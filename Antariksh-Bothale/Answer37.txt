 Antariksh BothaleMy roommates and I were discussing (in jest, in case that isn't clear) yesterday night that we should all root for Sundar Pichai for the MS CEO role, just so that we can maintain the IIT hegemony in the tech industry. Jokes apart, though, I think most people realize and acknowledge that hard work and stellar performance almost always trump academic pedigree. This is likely to be overwhelmingly true for the choice of a CEO, where you'd rather judge a person on the acumen they have shown and the results they have delivered for their company across the years, rather that what school they graduated from 25 years ago. If it is true that Sundar Pichai was a strong contender for the post, I am rather confident that at no point of the selection process did anyone say "But this one is from IIT and that one is not!", except perhaps as a joke.Academic pedigree does often help you (or make it easier to) get into desirable jobs in the beginning of your professional career. It also usually increases your chance of being at the right place at the right time, and of grabbing a good opportunity. It also makes it more likely to be part of a great peer group, and these things come with other synergistic effects. It is also likely to lead to a more enriching undergraduate / graduate experience. But it is neither necessary nor sufficient for being 'successful' in life, and this probably stands true for a widely diverse range of metrics of success.IITians would do well to realize (if there are those that already don't do so) that the IIT on their resume doesn't give them a trump card or an all-access pass, and those who could not get into IIT despite wanting to would be well-advised to not consider their academic background a major impediment.This is true for the IITs, just as it is true for top US schools, and I don't think Satya Nadella's appointment has changed that.[1] I am assuming here that many people consider an IIT degree to be academic pedigree.
