 Antariksh BothaleMy experience has largely been with scholarship/fellowship interviews, consulting interviews and CS coding interviews. At least in an interview setting, the tell me about yourself question is a pretty useful conversational starter and is often used by people to break the ice and make the interviewee comfortable. It is important that you dont get tensed up; instead, use this question to ramp up the interview. Jaime has talked about the kind of content you should have in your 'About Me'. A few more pointers:Avoid rambling: Sometimes, when people haven't thought of what they want to say, they end up talking incoherently for a long time. You will bore the interviewer and likely make them disinterested. Do some homework on the kind of values the company has. It might be good to show them in your work to improve your cultural fit within the company. For scholarship interviews, it is useful if you can link stuff in your background with the values of the funding organization.If it is a general scholarship kind of interview where they are judging my overall profile, I like to end with my hobbies / other interests or whatever I like to do for fun. This helps me in two ways: It helps me end my monologue on a confident note, and it gives an easy anchor point that the interviewer can use to steer further discussionI think the ideal sweet spot is when your answer shows preparation (that you have thought about what you want to say), but doesn't look entirely rehearsed. In short, prepare a list of things you want to talk about, but dont memorize the answer word by word. Answers that sound rehearsed are a turn off, especially if you are applying for a job that relies on communication.
