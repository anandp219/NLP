 Antariksh BothaleLast month, I got one of the nicest compliments I could have gotten as a human being.A guy pinged me one day and, after a small preamble, came out to me. He then said that he had told only a couple of friends so far and that I was probably the 4th or 5th person to know. Now, a bunch of people have come out to me prior to this, and it's not a big deal. But in this case, I was a bit surprised because I didn't know him. He is a junior from my university, but we have probably just met on a couple of occasions.I told him I was totally fine with it, and that he could trust me, but that I was curious why he had chosen to tell me despite not knowing me well. He replied that he had read my answers on Quora and the stuff that I write on my blogs and that I came off as a tolerant and rational person, and so he felt safe telling me what was probably the biggest secret of his life.Frankly speaking, this is one of the warmest compliments anyone can get.I wrote this in my answer to Interpersonal Interaction: How can I make myself more broad-minded?, and I'd reiterate it hereWe don't exist in a vacuum. We are a part of a complex society and our actions contribute to the overall health of the society. Everything we say and do, especially in public places and public forums, can have invisible but strong influences.If you are the sort of guy who makes homophobic remarks just to look cool, you are helping create an environment where gay folks feel scared and insecure. If you are someone who makes boorish remarks about women, it doesn't matter then that you think 'rapists should be hanged' or that you participated in candle-lights vigils after the Delhi gang rape. The truth is that you also ended up contributing to creating a negative environment for women. So don't be such a person. We don't need to put on a cape to help people. There are easier, more effective ways.[Thanks to Anasuya for 'editorial work']
