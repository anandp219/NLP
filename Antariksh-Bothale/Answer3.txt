 Antariksh BothaleAs others have written, while the term cottage cheese is commonly used to denote Paneer, there are slight differences in the way the two are made, and the ultimate difference from an end-product point of view is that paneer is pressed and comes out as a solid that can then be cut, while cottage cheese is wet and has loose curds which cannot be used the way paneer is used in Indian dishes. I've tried making palak paneer (paneer in a spinach gravy) using cottage cheese, and though I tried to strain the cheese, I still ended up with the cheese splitting and breaking down into tiny chunks and spreading all over the gravy.So what is the solution? Simple. Use the term Paneer and give people one of the following options: Tell them to buy paneer from an Indian storeIf an Indian store is not accessible, tell them how they can make a close approximation of paneer from cottage cheese, because if they use cottage cheese off the shelf in Indian paneer recipes, they will not get what they are aiming for.If they are particularly enthusiastic about it, tell them how to make paneer from scratch. It's not very tough, actually, and Youtube has tonnes of videos. Here's one by my favorite Youtube chef.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...English is a wonderful language that does not shy in absorbing foreign vocabulary. Let's add to the lexicon. :)
