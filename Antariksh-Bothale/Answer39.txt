 Antariksh BothaleAs a general rule, if you are in a foreign country, it is usually never a problem if you try to speak the local language [and appear to be making a genuine attempt rather than trying to mock them]. The response you get may vary slightly with where you try this, but it is in general positive. In countries where English is taught but not really spoken all that much, the service staff would mostly be more than glad to talk to you in t the local language, and even humor your potentially wrong attempts at it. Even in places like India, where most people in the service industry (such as in fast-food places and so on) speak in English, and where English is relatively more common in every day life, we love listening to foreigners speak Hindi (or whatever the relevant local language is), even if it is just a terribly mispronounced "NuhMUHsTay". In some cases, though, especially in countries whose local language is spoken no where else, and where English literacy levels are very high, people are sometimes reluctant to talk to outsiders in the local language. Whether this is out of courtesy for the listener or out of the annoyance of having to listen to your language being butchered by a non-native speaker, or a mix of both, I don't know. Personally, as a language learning enthusiast, I find it very very annoying if I make an attempt to speak in the local language and I get replied to in English, but I usually give people the benefit of doubt and assume that they either did it out of courtesy or just wanted to practise English.Finally, when you are in the queue at a fast-food place or even in a busy supermarket, people might just not have the time or patience to entertain your attempts at trying to communicate in the local language if you are not making a lot of sense. So it might be better, in such circumstances, to communicate efficiently in English, and delay language practice to a more suitable time.Most people appreciate it when someone tries to learn / speak their language, and tend to warm up considerably to foreigners who do so. Don't miss the chance!
