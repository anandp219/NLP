 Antariksh BothaleI dislike most selfies, but not for deep psychological reasons. My reason is very personal and very, err, selfishMost selfies aren't good. By good, I mean, good-looking photographs that have value for people other than those photographed (or their very close friends). And because of social media, we have to end up seeing them anyway. However, that should of course not stop people from taking them. Which is why I speak just for myself.In the last few years, mobile cameras were getting better, so you came across plenty of decent pictures on your stream. At the same time, more and more people started owning DSLRs, or had friends with DSLRs, so you ended up seeing lots of good quality pictures on your feed. If pictures are aesthetically pleasing, they are fun to look at.Then came selfies, which took us back to the 2009 era in terms of overall photo quality. Portrait shots look best at higher focal lengths, and the effect of low focal lengths on selfie shots can best be seen below. Notice how the leftmost shot of the woman and the rightmost shot of the man are 'selfie-like', while the opposite end is the kind of shot you'd see in a magazine.(Couldn't find the original source for either image. Both have been uploaded several times on various websites).So now people choose to chronicle major events of their life (weddings, graduation etc.) with selfies. These were the kind of events for which I'd earlier see extremely high quality shots taken in good lighting conditions. Photographs that were a pleasure to look at even if you didn't directly care about the event. Now, we get grainy, close-range shots with 5-6 seemingly dismembered and 2-3 partially covered heads with everything looking out of proportion. Definitely not my favorite style for capturing special moments.All that being said, it's their choice to make, not mine to prescribe. Nonetheless, it is an interesting and curious social trend.
