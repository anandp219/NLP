 Antariksh BothaleI hope that, by graduate studies, you mean something akin to an MS and not a PhD. You shouldn't join a PhD program abroad if it is not paying you any salary at all and requires you to take loans.While it's not possible to suggest what you should do without a more detailed understanding of your family's financial situation, as a general rule, I won't particularly recommend selling off family assets if you can avoid it.INR 30 Lakh is not an insanely large loan amount if you are going to enter an industry that is well-paying (which seems to be the case). For instance, if this were a CS degree, and you were going to get into Software Development jobs, you are all but assured an annual income of (at least) around USD 80 K.Job markets can be tough, though, and things can be trickier in Europe, so you should have a realistic assessment of all that. If your undergrad (and now grad) are from prestigious universities, that would certainly make things a bit easier.This also, of course, depends on where the asset is. If it is depreciating rapidly due to any reason, you might consider selling it. But most land assets in developing / upcoming cities in India usually appreciate more than your loan interest rate. Either way, this is something you should discuss with someone who has a better idea of the property market, and that is certainly not me.Finally, you should apply for scholarships in India that provide interest free loans. Some of them are: Narotam Sekhsaria Scholarship, K C Mahindra Fellowship, J N Tata Endowment Scholarship. Note that this year's cycle is largely over, so if you want one of those you might have to apply next year.(A2A)
