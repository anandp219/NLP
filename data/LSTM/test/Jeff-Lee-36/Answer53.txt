Can you see  now  that it was not truly threatening and the matter could have simply ended with  "Dude  I am flattered  but I don't swing that way " and end with a smile and a handshake? Did you ever have uncomfortable thoughts of attraction to another guy  and then repress them in shame because you were afraid of being rejected by family? Can you see  now  that it is common in youth  means nothing  and you need not fear  and that even if you were bisexual  your family would probably not reject you?Did you have a role model who was extremely homophobic and you simply adopted all this persons values because he was a trusted mentor  and made you feel special  and that you were not mature enough at the time to question that belief  or question him  and that you are now free to form your own conclusions based on its merits and on your own values?You certainly are correct to want to question your beliefs and change them if your higher values encourage you to do so.
