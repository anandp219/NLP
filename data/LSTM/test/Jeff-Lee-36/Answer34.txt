  And what if you get hit by lightning  and what if a meteorite hits the earth? These are not much different or worse than "what if I weren't short?" and "what if I wasn't born poor and black?" An alternative to "what if..bad" and "what if..wasn't " is the more optimistic  "what if I win the lottery?" and "what if I get that promotion?" The "what if..good? "  exercise is at least not entirely wasted thought in that it could prepare you for something that you actually want  and some beneficial background subissues and subplots could be resolved in your unconcious mind allowing you to capitalize on opportunities that might lead to such outcomes.
