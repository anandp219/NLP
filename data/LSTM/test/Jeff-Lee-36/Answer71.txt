  I am not sure I understand the second part of the question  it is perhaps a translation into English problem? Or is it that the number of assumptions made by the OP are so outside the norm that I am unable to see a linkage to something that the OP sees as causal connections? Regarding the first part  I don't believe one can make the assumption that introversion and extroversion are heritable traits. They are an epiphenomenon  a byproduct of ego. Identical twins raised in opposite environments would have opposite fears  beliefs  reactions  preferences  etc.
