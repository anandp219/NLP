  I am not sure what disconnect you see between being a socialist and being homophobic. It is perhaps atypical  and therefore makes you stand out if your liberal friends all share a common point of view and you don't happen to share that one. If this is your motivation for change  it is not a good one  and it will fail if your goal is to be internally judgmental but desiring to be externally accepting so that your friends do not accuse you of being intellectually bankrupt. Your thoughts are your own  and you are the only one who can will to change them.
