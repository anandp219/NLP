  Isn't that generally due to areas that were cleared by fire? If the new growth is only two or three feet tall  it is probably three years since the fire  therefore I don't think you would see charred evidence. There are many lightning fires that burn anywhere from one acre to 5000 acres  and then start regrowing within a few seasons. The only other thing would be if the area you were at was within twenty miles down from Mt. St. Helen  but that area should be a full height forest by now  unless it continued to erode from rain for many seasons before the growth could take hold.
