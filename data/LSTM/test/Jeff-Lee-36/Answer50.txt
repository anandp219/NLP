  If we talk of the Self  it cannot be improved. But  self can become more aware of Self  that would be improvement. How? Through living our most full life possible  by following our highest values  we discover who we really are. It can begin with meditation  and practicing mindfulness  practicing forgiveness  doing community service  helping others and seeing our fellow man through trusting eyes. When we stop judging  we are able to see our brothers and sisters as whole and healed  and as we see them  we will see our self.
