You will fall a thousand times  but you need only get up one thousand and one. Eventually you will reach a happy state of benevolence that is unprideful and you will know your true self. There are a variety of techniques that help  including meditation  mindfulness  forgiveness of others  service to your community or to individuals. My belief is that they all have value  and each of us has a different path based on our unique issues that we need to overcome. But  it is not a theoretical issue requiring intellectual analysis because we are talking about the human organism.
