Try and empathize with the gay person who thinks and acts exactly as you do  in every single way but one. What legitimate reason could you have for judging? Why would that one thing make that person not be deserving of equal protection under the law  or of having someone love them  or deserve your respect? I hope you are sincere  and that you join the mainstream of thought that values all humans in all their cultural diversity. Socialistic thought has great merit  partly because it does value inclusion.
