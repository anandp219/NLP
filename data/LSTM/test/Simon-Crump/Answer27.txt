  There is a wide variety of responses  ranging from "Oh no  these people have had such a hard time and are so desperate  we must do everything we can to help them" to "We have too many foreigners in this country already  we must stop any more of them coming in". Both these extremes and everything in between can be heard in just about every European country. In some countries  such as Germany  more people lean more toward the former view  in others such as Hungary  more people lean toward the latter.Europe is not one nation and so part of what makes the situation so difficult is that many people are inclined to see it all as somebody else's problem.
