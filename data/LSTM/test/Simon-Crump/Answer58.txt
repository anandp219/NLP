  When policemen become indistinguishable from soldiers  liberty has already been lost. There is nothing left to defend. The right to bear arms does not and cannot protect US citizens from the state. No militia could ever hope to challenge it now  no matter how many automatic weapons they have stashed in their log cabins. That particular arms race has already been decided.This is what a police officer looks like where I live (see below). Outside of high-profile targets such as airports  the most lethal weapon he carries is a can of pepper spray.
