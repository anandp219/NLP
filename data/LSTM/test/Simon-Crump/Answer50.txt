  No  because it has been demonstrated in the last few years that the Euro project is flawed.In principle a single currency is a good idea because it reduces transaction costs across the trading zone and eliminates the uncertainty that exchange rate fluctuations cause. Such benefits were indeed observed following the introduction of the Euro.However  if the currency is shared by several countries which implement varying fiscal policies  problems can arise. Without a fiscal union or federal structure which oversees fiscal policy  divergent policies will exert pressure on the monetary union.
