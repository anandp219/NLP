  Not by any definition of socialism that I accept.Part of the problem here is that the word "socialism" has become almost meaningless as it means so many different things to different people. Over the last hundred years such an astonishing range of atrocities and economic disasters have been foisted upon the world by people calling themselves socialists that modern socialism has become a wearying process of redefinition and revisionism. Some would have you believe that any system other than unrestrained anarcho-capitalism is socialism.
