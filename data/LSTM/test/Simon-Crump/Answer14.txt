The total supply of guns available to criminals in the UK is so low that there have even been cases of the same gun being used by opposite sides at different times in a conflict between criminal gangs. Likewise  it's much easier to track the flow of guns to terrorist groups in an environment where guns are unusual and not part of the normal landscape. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland  British intelligence had a fairly good idea of exactly how many guns the paramilitaries had  where they were stored and who controlled them.School shootings happen because of an over-supply of guns.
