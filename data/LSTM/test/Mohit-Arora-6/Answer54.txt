  Disclaimer - The answer below are my personal views.There are a lot of benefits of working in Adobe India. First of all  I do not have any experience in working with any other firm in India so I am not sure if these benefits are provided by other firms as well.1. Work life balance - This is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Adobe. You get ample amount of time to do things you like other than work. You can easily follow your hobbies and get the work done at the same time. Adobe has a gym  four table tennis tables  two foosball tables  a lawn tennis court  a basketball court  7 cricket teams  an informal guitar club  a toastmasters club  and so much more of the fun stuff.
