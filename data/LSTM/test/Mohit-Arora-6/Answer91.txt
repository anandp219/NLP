Remember  Mike left Philadelphia the next day after he killed those cops. And now he is working in Albuquerque for at least some time. The daughter-in-law didn't get to know about the deaths right away (Mike didn't tell her when she took him home when he arrived in ABQ). She might have got to know about this through some old neighbors or acquaintance in ABQ. As soon as she got to know about this she called the PD inquiring about the case.May be they were already looking for Mike to take his statement about the cold blooded murder of the two cops  and didn't know that he was in Albuquerque (which is very strange considering that he is working in a government office).
