  Most of the major cities in the country have stadiums for table tennis where there are coaches to train you. I know at least about Jaipur  Jodhpur  Delhi  Chennai and various cities in West Bengal where you can find amazing table tennis coaches who can train you very well and get you ready to represent India at international level (of course  it depends on how dedicated you are).But if I have to select just one coaching institute then I would most definitely go for Petroleum Sports Promotion Board's table tennis academy in Ajmer.
