  If I have to choose one  I will go with dogs. Those wild  bully dogs. Yeah  people keep them in their house to protect them but what about the visitors who do not have any intention to rob your house? These dogs start barking madly and try to climb you like you are a mountain and their goal is to reach the peak which happens to be your mouth. And I hate those owners who  instead of controlling their dogs from doing so  laugh at the misery of the visitors and later apologize with a grinning smile saying their dog is notorious.
