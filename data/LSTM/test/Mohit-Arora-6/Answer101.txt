New people usually don't know Quora very well and at first write copied content as blog posts. There are hundreds of science blogs  sports blogs  latest news blogs  "interesting and cool stuff" blogs on Quora and most of them copy the articles from newspapers or other blogs on the internet (mostly without attribution). I know people learn with time  about how to better use Quora  but again  I am not one of the persons who can help them with that.So  I just ignore any invitations to join blogs by people I don't personally know.That said  if I know someone well and have respect for their writing  I would at least accept the invitation to follow their blog.
