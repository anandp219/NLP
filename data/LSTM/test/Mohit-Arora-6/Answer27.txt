People shout and run behind the buses and then book an auto when they miss the bus. Guys ask their girl friends to keep hold of a seat for them in the bus. And then there are people who want to study on weekends as well. So yeah  they pack their laptops in their bags and head towards the lab.Weekends are also utilized to complete the work of copying assignments from the one guy who actually took the trouble to do it on his own and who is not sure whether he did it right or not. Weekends are also utilized for the meetings to discuss the ideas for semester projects but those meetings often end with a long discussion about classmates  professors  director  or even guards.Not to forget  the awesome morning tea with bread and butter in that small shop in the Peepal gaanv.And those tireless visits to the stationary shop on the morning of the project presentation.
