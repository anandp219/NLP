  Amit's account has been banned from Quora for repeated policy violations. After the ban he was a given access to his account for a certain time frame so that he can make whatever changes he wants to make to his content. Amit decided to delete all his answers and posts (if any). Unlike questions  answers and posts written by a particular user belong to that user and not to the Quora community. So they are free to do whatever they want to do with their content.There is no way Quora can "put that answer back."
