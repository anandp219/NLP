The threats to not release the movie started almost a week after the hack.2. This was a well planned attack and would have taken at least few weeks of planning  if not months. I don't think at that time North Korea would have the knowledge that a movie like The Interview  which is based on a plan to assassinate their supremo  was under production. So  the attack was not made just to stop this movie from airing.3. Almost everything points to the fact that this is an inside job. It was like the hackers knew the entire structure of Sony's network.
