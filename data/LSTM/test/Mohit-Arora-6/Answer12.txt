When Brody died  she came to her senses and realized that she cannot handle the responsibility of a baby. That is when she wanted to go for an abortion but her father and sister stopped her from doing so. So  she didn't love her baby even before the baby was born.That said  there is no doubt in it that the Baby was Brody's. Earlier  Carrie didn't want anyone to know this thing. She didn't even tell Brody that she was pregnant with his baby until they were in the safe house in the last episode. Again  she was tremendously confused whether she should give birth to this baby or not and probably that is why she didn't tell anyone about it.
