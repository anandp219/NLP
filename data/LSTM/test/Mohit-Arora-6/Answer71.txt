The element of surprise is still there. Little  but there. And of course  the thrill that you experience in the moment of action makes this show one of the best shows currently on air. But I would really love if the makers of the show can give us something different. For example  I know that the group is gonna spend the next half of the season wandering on roads fighting zombies and looking for a safe haven. I am definitely ready for a surprise. Please do something more eventful.
