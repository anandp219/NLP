For example  anything related to Cricket is taken very seriously in India and I can see people posting all kind of shit during major cricket tournaments. They engage with others in pointless debates  use derogatory remarks if the conversation is not proceeding according to their own perception of something.Another thing is religion. People just get too hyper when it comes to religion. Someone from the Pakistan writes a comments on some Indian page  all the Indians are over that guy  saying all kind of crap to him (and vice versa).I originally loved Quora because people here were supportive and rational.
