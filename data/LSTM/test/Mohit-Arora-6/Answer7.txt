I think the informant knew this thing and they also knew that bombing this wedding would put CIA's back to the wall and will probably deflect them from this case (Lockhart was exactly following this approach when he decided to keep Carrie at Langley. )I am pretty sure that Lockhart never interacted with Sandy's informant. I think he didn't even know who he/she was. He just knew that Sandy was getting the information and since it was profiting him (Lockhart) he decided to keep his mouth shut about it.
