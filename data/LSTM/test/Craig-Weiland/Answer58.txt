I have to be available in the office to everyone else  so I'm here during the day too. I work with many different people in different divisions all over the company  as well as people at our retail locations calling in from all corners of the territory. I have to be able to listen to these people  and understand what they're looking for even when they don't really know how to express it. (Fortunately  they usually do  but not always.) I have to deliver work that will do what they need it to do  and I don't always have the final say in that.
