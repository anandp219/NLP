  It is a simple rewording of the ancient adage "Fortune favors the bold. "Today  it just means that those people who take initiative to solve their own problems usually find better luck in their endeavors. Religious people attribute this to their deity of choice. This is pure confirmation bias. Even hard-working people suffer misfortunes; working hard is not a protective shell against bad things happening to them. "Fortune favors the bold" was  interestingly  an invocation of a deity in its original sense.
