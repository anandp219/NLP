  I think it is cool. The Apple Music logo was not dependent on its choice of typeface for its recognizability.This is actually pretty generic. So it seems natural to me that Apple would liven it up with different typefaces  representing the variability in people's musical preferences. The campaign photographed in the question details makes perfect sense to me.This is the second logo I've seen that incorporates Apple's new San Francisco Compact (the first being that for the Apple Watch). It seems like a touchup of Nudista Bold to me.
