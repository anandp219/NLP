  Because dependence is a form of slavery.If you are dependent upon someone else for money to live  you must do what they say. They have power over you. At any time  they can cut off your money supply and if they're your only source of income  you must make sure this doesn't happen. That means you have no choice but to do what they want.Independence means no one else has that kind of power over you.I could never just accept my parents' money to support me. That would mean I'd be giving them tacit veto power over anything I wanted to do.
