Something you do for yourself  something that touches on one of your most cherished life passionsyou know you have them.If a friend (or lover) wants to come  by all means share this with them... but it is yours  not theirs to derail and compromise with concessions to their preferences. Don't let anyone else try to force you to settle for less than your goal.When you feel depressed and alone  and feeling like there's no point to it all  remind yourself that you have a plan  you are working your plan and that someday it will be complete.
