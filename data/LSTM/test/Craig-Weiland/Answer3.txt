Portal 2 is a fully developed triple-A first person "shooter" with incredible writing  puzzle design  environments and voice acting. The character of GLaDOS is  in my opinion  one of the most enjoyable  intriguing and flawlessly realized video game characters I've ever encountered.The Portal games have been recognized as some of the best video games ever made. Eurogamer had this to say about the series: "Portal is perfect. Portal 2 is not. It's something better than that."
