  Be nice if they could  but no.Adobe's Multiple Master technology was abandoned in the early 2000s  since the OpenType standard has succeeded it on Windows and Mac platforms.If you want to have access to the full capability of MM fonts  I suggest you get a copy of MMAFM which can export new weights generated from the MM source fonts  and these exported fonts can be used in current design programs like InDesign. (I have not tried to do this myself  but it seemed the only free-software solution I could find.)
