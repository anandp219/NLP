I feel like I'm making the world just a little bit better  even though none of those farmers know who I am. When I see one of our trucks go past on the road  with my livery on it  I smile to myself. I think  that's one of my trucks. If only my 10-year-old self could see me now... actually  he kind of does.The pride I take in what I do does not come cheap or easy. I work very hard  often coming back to the office on evenings and weekends when it's quiet  so I can concentrate on a project without any interruption.
