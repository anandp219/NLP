Seeing an ad in our periphery in the morning for a certain television show may prompt us to go looking for it on Netflix later in the day. Seeing an ad for Pop-Tarts somewhere in our Web surfing can tickle a "oh yeah  Pop-Tarts" idea the next time we're carting our way past them in the grocery store aisle. An ad for an expensive  trendy new Bluetooth speaker may find its way onto our Amazon wish-list at a future date.All it needs to do is find just the slightest amount of our attention  and its mission is accomplished.
