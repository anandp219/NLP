What can I do? "]Don't pass on the blame to the 'other': The government is responsible for corruption  the rich & greedy for money-laundering  the media for unwanted sensationalism  the uneducated for committing all the rapes across the nation? When we pass on the blame to someone else for crimes happening in the society  we miss an opportunity to look within ourselves. But remember- whether it be the government or a random rapist on the street: they're all by-products of this society. Odds are if me or you were to be elected into the position of power  we'd have done the same as the government official.
