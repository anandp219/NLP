I'm not sure how many other Nobel Laureates have such modesty. PS. I did write him an email to which I didn't get a reply. I read the email again today  and I'd myself never reply to that kiddish (non-specific  generic) email. As I said  I lost Dr. Dreze's email ID soon  so rather than emailing him or catching up with Dr. Khera in my own college I updated on Facebook that I met a Nobel Laureate for the first time. Sigh  to be 21!
