And from here  it was cheers for Federer all the way. Even as everyone settled in their seats  snippets of RF would invite wild cheers. But it became extremely cathartic  when he finally set foot and the whole crowd stood in unison for a standing ovation. An excellent thing about the crowd was even though they supported and hooted for Federer with "Roger"  "Federer" chants whenever he won points/games  whenever Groth pulled off a splendid point the audience was quick to show him appreciation despite affiliations.
