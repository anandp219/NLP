  The word which is the source of controversy here is "intelligent men". The question justifies the word with: "intelligent men hold more credentials  so their view matters". However if the question were "do many men think men are biologically superior to women in terms of rationality" the answer can be probably a yes. But here's the problem- the ones dismissing the lack of intellect and rationality in women can themselves be lacking in the same qualities so much. Indeed rationality is a rare trait in humans of both genders.
