So to summarize- I've no pressing need to migrate from my current platforms and when I will  I'll look for the cheapest alternative to get the task done. Just because I earn enough to afford stuff doesn't mean I have to spend it on stuff I don't need.Also a final point worth adding. The feeling of pity Apple users have for others with the question "why would anyone not buy Mac" gives non-Apple users enough reasons to not associate with the brand.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------* MS Office can do lots of fancy stuff  I don't use it for that though
