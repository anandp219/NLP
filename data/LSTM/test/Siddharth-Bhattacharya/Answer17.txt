  Celebrated where? That's the important question. Others have suggested examples like George Washington being a slave-owner  Gandhi being sexist/ racist doesn't modify their overall accomplishments (democratic  peaceful world respectively). While true  these leaders genuinely contributed a lot and are perceived positively widely across the globe. However there are leaders with much less flattering records  much lesser positive contributions to humanity and way more harm who either enjoy a positive image in their territory or have policies against badmouthing them.Image: Warmongers with great PRs with sketchy human right recordEven Truman  Nixon  Reagan amongst themselves have led to loss of civilian lives in Japan  Korea Vietnam  Grenada  Libya etc.
