  Natural inequality: By natural  I mean an inequality which will exist in any economic system. The root cause for such economic inequality is definitely market dynamics  leading to more rewards for those who possess the precise skills required to manufacture and sell goods which add value to the lives of consumers. Note the usage of the term value to consumers  rather than value to society which are different things and the latter due to being highly subjective doesn't result in a consensus of what it is.
