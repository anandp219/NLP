Of course  this answer also has been trimmed leaving many important events especially in recent history which affected geopolitics of the region a lot. However I've tried to focus on the notion of religion as an identity than just a set of beliefs  and how history plays a role. Anyways if there is a separate question somewhere on how we all commoners should deal with these issues  I will happy to address them within this historical context.
