Religion feeds on the primal instinct of fear within humans to restrain them from committing heinous acts which they would have otherwise justified as "necessary" citing circumstances. The fear of a divine creature who can punish these individuals is a wonderful concept to create restraint. Coming to the present times when after the evolution  morality has indeed seeped through within us. Do we still need religion? This is a scene of a slum in my country- India. The scene is not as beautiful as America.
