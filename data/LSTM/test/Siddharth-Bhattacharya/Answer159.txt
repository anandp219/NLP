What can be done regarding it? Limit distribution: When Quora was released  only invited people could join- which is a prime reason why discussions on this website are so awesome. It can be done again. If Quora decides it needs to pander to it's Indian audience  it can send some invites to Indians from varied fields. Alternately stop new members until Quora gets diverse enough from all over the world. Spread to Europe: This is very important. Europe has an amazing history  an awesome blend of cultures  has been the home of most famous wars  has best competitive football and (well before US)-the hub of popular culture.
