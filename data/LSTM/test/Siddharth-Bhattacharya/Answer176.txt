However in winter  even the lakes freeze completely making them good for sports but it's again a matter on being able to endure the cold for so long out in the open. Outdoor activities definitely get stagnated in winters  and beauty of snow also loses it's charm in few days when everywhere you see  it's snow.So to summarize life in Madison (or nearby Wisconsin cities) is really tough in the winters especially for someone not used to the terrible chilly winds and winters are a real hindrance to lots of activities you could have done otherwise although at least Madison has opportunities for social activities.
