Just like Bible- here also we have Sybille Trellawney prophesizing the birth of 'Chosen One' who predicts he will the cause of the fall of the 'Dark Lord' Voldemort. Also she predicts the rise of Peter Pettigrew correcttly. It almost sounds silly a 17-year old boy killing the Dark Lord who great fighters couldn't ever. Thus the odds of fulfilling the prophecies is very low- nevertheless it happens. This boy also dies for few troubling moments  just to get up: a resurrection.Now if someone asks for an explanation of how all these otherwise incomprehensible phenomenon can be explained and how these predictions were right- the answer is pretty simple.
