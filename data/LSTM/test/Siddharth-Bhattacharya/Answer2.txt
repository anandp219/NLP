And it's easy to see other's irrationality while failing to recognize one's own. Why lots of men see women as irrational creatures is because of seeing them as "the other". I have came across too many of my male friends making statements like "you can't reason with a girl. They're emotional creatures." If I try to argue with them on social conditioning and gender roles  they'll start laughing at me. Are these intelligent men? I am not sure if they are unwilling to have rational arguments on their generalizations  they're very rational or intelligent.
