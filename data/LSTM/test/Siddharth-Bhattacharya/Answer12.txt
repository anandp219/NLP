Nevertheless I kept reading news on my forte- sports. Explored more on it: on whatever interested me. I also used to read novels. Passive references to history  events compelled to explore some more. Indian literature motivated me to read more on India. So when I came back a year later into quizzing arena  I could at least clear prelims- it was all about curiosity. When I couldn't excel in my college- I searched other avenues. Tried inter-college events: won various accolades. By the end- though I am nowhere near the best in my college- I've won accolades representing my college  within my college  as well as featured 2-3 times on TV.
