It's by no means trivial  but lack of visa requirements will tilt things more in your favor given experience with good projects. If you perform really well  they can send you to offices in US. After working for > 1 year  you can even go on L-1  which doesn't require lotteries.One of the most widely followed route- get admitted into Master's degree in US. Preferably CS/math/electrical since you asked Silicon Valley. Most people don't get scholarships or make to MIT/Princeton. Don't worry  go for it.
