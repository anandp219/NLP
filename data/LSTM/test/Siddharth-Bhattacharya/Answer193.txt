  Consider his resignation as a hedging strategy for his vote bank. Last few months have been very volatile for the party in terms of it's perception amongst voters  and he needed a strategy to contain any further losses. Arvind Kejriwal's resignation is a political statement signifying on one side the party's assertiveness to contest the Lok Sabha elections; on the other side  it's a statement to his voters of his frustration with the current corrupt system which didn't let him work. Resignation- when passed off as bullying into submission by big-wigs- creates sympathy amongst people.
