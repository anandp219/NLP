India is a democracy. Good intent or even same intentions can lead to paralysis. India has got a majority government last year  but that party is a minority in the upper house till 2017  so pretty helpless in passing ordinances. Traditional roles for women historically means very few women in police force  and this is one of the main things required. Even though women have started to break traditional barriers  and are pursuing this path aggressively now it will take a lot to undo the rigid norms and have a sizeable police force comprised of women.
