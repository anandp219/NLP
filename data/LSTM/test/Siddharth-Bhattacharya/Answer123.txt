  The explanations of Messianic prophecies would be no different from explaining whatever goes on in Harry Potter books. (Disclaimer: I'm sorry if I offend anyone's Christian sentiments  but an explanation is hardly possible without it. )*Spoiler Alert for Harry Potter* There's a 10-year old boy who can run through platforms at Kings Cross while no one nearby can. He can also speak to snakes. He can fly on brooms. What's more- he can wave a stick in his hand  speak few words and lots of incomprehensible things happen- feathers fly (wingardium leviosa)  lights illuminate (lumos)  people are frozen (stupefy)  some ghostly creatures run away (expecto patronum) & even people die (avada kedavra).
