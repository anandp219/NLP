For instance  had he apologized for 1984 riots or accepted Congress role in abetting it  it could have given his political opponents points to use for the remaining campaign. So he chose silence and let his detractors poke fun for his foolishness than something sordid. After all  being stupid is better than being evil in politics. Anyways if you're wondering which side I'm on. When I was in college  I read Vir Sanghvi's articles which spoke convincingly in support of Rahul. So I do believe RG does lots of empowerment behind the scenes  and has transformational ideas for his own party and if it was someone else doing the same  it could have won applause.
