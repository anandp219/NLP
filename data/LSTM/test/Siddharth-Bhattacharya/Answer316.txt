Especially within India  some of them are more lucrative compensation-wise than Google  Microsoft offers. Personal caseAs I can see people asking me anyhow on my specific case  I didn't have a major in CS  but Mathematics & Computing from IIT-Delhi. I didn't have a particularly high GPA (~ 7.5/10). During on-campus placements  I'd not read from so many sources. I just did well enough to get through Epic's coding exam and interview. When I began reapplying within US  I got interviews in Google  FB  Microsoft  Amazon via referrals from friends/ batchmates.
