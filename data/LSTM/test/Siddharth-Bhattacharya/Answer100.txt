At some level  it can also hamper white people if they're seen to be not into math as much as Asians inherently. The important thing is acknowledging any such aberration (if statistically true) based on race/caste/gender etc is a result of social conditioning rather than an inherent state. Not recognizing this leads to prejudices and unequal opportunities based on extraneous characteristics. On the other hand  dismissing a statistically correct statement as racist closes the door for discussion and improvement.
