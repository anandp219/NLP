As a result  you have lots of people dressed in crazy costumes attending the fest with lots of amazing practices.I know I make it sound like the hippy celebration aspect of it was the interesting part and I kind of killed the historic site in drunken boorishness  but really what made it special was a mixture of the ability to come close to the stones as well as the festive environment. The only downside was it rained excessively that night  and given that it's a vast open field there was no shelter and only choice was to get wet.How does it feel to touch the stones?Normal.
