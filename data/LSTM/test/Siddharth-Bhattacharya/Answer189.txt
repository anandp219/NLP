Cool  he maybe doing revolutionary work behind the scenes but the electorate needs instant gratification and symbolisms and he doesn't concern himself with them. Nevertheless he would possibly be a good candidate in judiciary rather than legislature- given his respect for democracy  alongside willingness to implement fresh ideas. The ideas he suggested aren't very different from Arvind Kejriwal's (empowering common man  increasing their stake  RTI)  yet he finds no supporters on social media while there would be AAP apologists posting "other side of the story" had AK been the one saying.
