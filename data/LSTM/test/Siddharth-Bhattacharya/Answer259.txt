So when people see Akshay Kumar jumping off buildings unscathed & dancing with gorgeous ladies or Salman beating 50 policemen at a time- who wouldn't want that? Or giving the youth who confront sex as a taboo some celebration about it with some 'catchy' beats. Achyut & Rachana have done the ad-hoc analysis of how Chetan Bhagat exploits populism already- writing about sex  IITs  IIMs.However there's a twist in what separates Chetan Bhagat's success from Salman or Honey's. The difference is inherent to the field of literature vs. music/movies- people find going through 400 pages of dry-text much tougher than viewing pictures in motion.
