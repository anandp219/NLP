There are many people possessing the necessary skills to complete the task  and thus the price for the skill lowers. This difference in skills becomes the root cause of economic inequality. An effect of this is market agents have no/lesser incentive to design goods for the lower end of economic spectrum  as it won't lead to profitable outcomes thus leading to what we call "rich becoming richer" phenomenon- increasing economic inequality. However this model of course assumes everyone has an equal opportunity.Artificial inequality: Unfortunately it's also possible to create economic inequality.
