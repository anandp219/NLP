)Although BJP doesn't support dynastical politics  it suffers in leadership issue:Lots of leaders-most notably Modi- have risen among the party ranks with their hardwork. Some- again notably Modi- have demonstrated capability to win elections. However not everyone's persona- again notably Modi- fits with other top-leaders. As a result we have squabbles with Advani  Jaitley  Modi and others battling for the top spot creating friction within the party. Conclusion: Manmohan was chosen rather than others as his name creates least opposition among party circles apart from his good performance  which is an essential component for functioning of a political party in a democracy.
