  This is indeed a very good question  which I've discussed with some of my Chinese programmer friends on multiple occasions. The question isn't really why there are no Chinese tech executives  but rather why there aren't Chinese tech executives in America. After all  Jack Ma (Alibaba) and the founders of Baidu  QQ  Weibo etc. are all powerful Chinese tech executives in China. So even though Jerry Yang (founder  Yahoo!) is a notable exception  it's true Indians have way more top-level prominent executives in US (Vic Gundotra  Vinod Khosla  Padmasree Warrior  Shantanu Narayen  Indra Nooyi  Vikram Pandit  Nikesh Arora) despite similar representation among programmer population.English: Whether you like the fact or not  when one is running boardroom meetings everyday  speaking to tons of customers etc language proficiency becomes very important.
