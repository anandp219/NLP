In short  this is the part where you demonstrate not being desperate and one where you're asking them to sell the company to you. A non-snarky and non-desperate attitude goes a long way. How to PrepareIf you haven't already  read a complete DS/algorithms book. I'd read Data Structures and Algorithms in Java: Michael T. Goodrich  Roberto Tamassia during my college placements. If you can (not required necessarily)  do try Introduction to Algorithms. This creates a firm base for trying out questions.
