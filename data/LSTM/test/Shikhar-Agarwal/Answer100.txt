It seems that the flexibility offered by the religion  which is its one of the biggest strengths  is hurting itself big time  thanks to all the misinformed and hypocritical society.Raksha Bandhan celebrates the bond  love and friendship between siblings; the sister prays for the well being of her brother while the brother promises to protect her under all circumstances.
