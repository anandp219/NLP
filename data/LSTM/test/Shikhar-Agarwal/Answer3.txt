  Mummy: Did you have dinner?Me: Yes.Mummy: What did you eat?Me: Only one question related to food!And then she smiles. Everyday  she asks "Did you have dinner" first...I believe Yes gives her the real satisfaction.Before I start my Skype conversation  I change my t-shirt to a particular one.Mummy: Again the same t-shirt! Do you ever bath? How many months have passed by since you have washed your clothes?Me: I just smileAnd then occasionally  I have a different t-shirtMummy: OMG  what happened today?
