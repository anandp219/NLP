Go on vacations or study hard? In which case would you actually get 100%? You would probably study hard because you know for sure that going on vacations would certainly not get you that top grade. Similarly  Krishna lives on Earth not because he knows what is going to happen when he is here  but because he knows what the world would become if he doesn't come here. Imagine the world with the likes of devils like Ravana or Hiranyaksha  females getting disrobed in the public  brothers killing each other  in short  total chaos spread like an epidemic.
