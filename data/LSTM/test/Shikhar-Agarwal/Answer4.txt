<big  big  smile>If it is my dad who initiates the Skype call:<Skype ringing  then I pick up>Silence...both of us are waiting for other to speak first. He finally lets go saying "bohot achi baat hai!" (great going!) and we both laugh. I think he loves me more than I do.I have 2 little cute teddy's (a lion and a small duck). Occasionally while talking  I would pick these and show them on the camera  zooming in and zooming out  making them dance. They just love it and makes the mood jovial. Occasionally my mother would "feed" them with cookies!And then some random stuff.
