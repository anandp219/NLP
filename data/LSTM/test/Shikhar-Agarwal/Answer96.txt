  I'd agree with Amit but then we'd both be wrong!I have seen brilliant answers on Quora  pouring knowledge all over the place  but Amit combines knowledge with humor and life experiences  turning every answer into a master piece  making it very intuitive for users to understand - this is how intellect differs from knowledge. I have learned a lot from him  both in terms of skill and knowledge  and a guru is always better than his student  no matter how much he praises this student out of humbleness.Amit it is  hands down _/\_
