  Once there was a general who was leading his army into a battle against an enemy much larger than his own. While going towards the battlefield  they stopped at the local temple to pray for strength and victory.The general held up a coin and told his army  "I am going to request God to help us defeat the enemy. If this coin lands with the head on top  we would win. Else we would lose. Today our fate is in the hands of the God. Let us all pray to Him".They all prayed for a short time and the general then tossed the coin.
