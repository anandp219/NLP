What better death can befit someone as brave and powerful as Karna than dying at the command of peerless Lord Krishna? Death is certain for anyone born here  especially when Lord is sitting in the chariot opposite to him  wishing that he dies - no sun or moon can save him. Clearly Surya understood that. Wouldn't have he put a blot on his son's life by his intention of helping him?Surya on that day didn't only follow his dharma towards the nature  but a greater dharma towards his son by letting him die in the fashion he deserved.
