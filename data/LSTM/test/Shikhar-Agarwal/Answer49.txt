If today Apple decides to donate iPhones to all of Africa  we won't say Africa has become a modern continent.I believe that being modern is a shift in science and technology  how we think  behave and act  and therefore requires a deeper understanding than what is visible in movies. Doing advanced research to develop power efficient phones like iPhone  packing millions of transistors to create Intel-like chips  creating weather-agnostic seeds  attempting to develop low cost drugs for cancer - these are modern advancements.
