We successfully put Mangalyan on Mars orbit  built nuclear weapons  constructed Metro transportation in cities - these reflected modernity. Modernity means treating servants and waiters with respect  not eve teasing a girl when you see her  neither judging nor caring about others while jogging on streets  not looking down upon a friend who is working part-time in McDonalds to pay his college's fees and so on.
