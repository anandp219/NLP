It does not says always - it says eventually. So you might gain by lying in the short term  but that's equivalent of settling with shorter trees. This is not how great nations are built. A nation that has to reach the zenith cannot have a foundation that is built on lying  jugaad and shortsightedness. India is lucky enough that since its early civilization  the teachings of our great sages  mythologies like Mahabharata  festivals like Navratri  in fact the entire culture celebrates the victory of good over evil  dharma over adharma  truth over lying.If we see  one of the major challenge that is pulling us back is corruption.
