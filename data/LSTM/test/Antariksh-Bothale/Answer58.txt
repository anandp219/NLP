  I think the golden standard for pranks is that  at the end of it  the prankee enjoys it  or at least  can derive fun / humor out of it. This usually rules out most pranks that cause physical harm  or put the person in considerable danger. Dangling someone from their feet over a ledge would mostly count as bullying  not pranking  for example  even if you have no desire to drop them.Also  I hate 'Crying Wolf' style of pranks  where you give your well-wishers a false alarm for the sake of a prank.
