Geek is not a universal label. It usually goes with specific subject-matter  such as car-geek  or train-geek  or astronomy-geek (though it is true that without the specific label  a geek is usually assumed to be a tech-geek  but that's besides the point).People like to put themselves into such labeled groups because it is a means of self-identification  and also simultaneously a means of signaling to and finding others with similar interests. It can be intensely frustrating to have a hobby that you do not share with anyone around you.
