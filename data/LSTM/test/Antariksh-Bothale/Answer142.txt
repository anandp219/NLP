Everything we say and do  especially in public places and public forums  can have invisible but strong influences.If you are the sort of guy who makes homophobic remarks just to look cool  you are helping create an environment where gay folks feel scared and insecure. If you are someone who makes boorish remarks about women  it doesn't matter then that you think 'rapists should be hanged' or that you participated in candle-lights vigils after the Delhi gang rape. The truth is that you also ended up contributing to creating a negative environment for women.
