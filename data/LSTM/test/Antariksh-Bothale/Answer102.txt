Worse  it's absolutely soul-crushing to be surrounded by people who not only don't share your hobby  but can't associate with that sort of crazed up geeky obsession with anything.And so if you are like a friend of mine  you'd join the Indian Railways Fan Club mailing list and would love to discuss this topic with others who can identify the make of a diesel engine by the sound of its horn.That brings us to food. Many people use the term foodies to refer to food geeks. I personally am not a fan of the word  largely because it sounds kinda childish  and  like most labels  it tends to be applied to anyone and everyone and sort of loses the point.
