This manifests itself in various forms  from the fashionable concept of the Friendzone  to more drastic consequences such as the Isla Vista killings.Finally  the root cause of injustices against both men and women is the patriarchal framework. For instance  men find it tougher to get custody because of the inherent assumption that women are better care givers  and what not. My problem with 'Equalism' is that it sets a target that most reasonable people cannot disagree with  without providing clarity about what exactly needs to be done  and masking out the fact that the playing field is tilted in one very-specific direction.
