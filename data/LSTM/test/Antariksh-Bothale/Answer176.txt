This kind of harmful messaging is all-pervasive  and phrases like "Be a man" are instances of the same  no matter what their original  optimistic intention be. I should point out here that "Be a lady" is almost equally regressive. A phrase sometimes found in Hindi stories is   (literally: diffidence / shyness fit for a lady). We no more want to teach girls they should always be diffident and shy than we want to teach boys that they should suck it up and not cry.When people talk about empowering women and removing gender divides  they focus largely on reducing rape and increasing employment for women.
