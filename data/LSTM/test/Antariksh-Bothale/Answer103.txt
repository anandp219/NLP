But the ultimate arbiter of language is usage  so I am fine if someone wishes to describe themselves using it. Also  I am very skinny  and the first question people ask is "But if you love food how come you are so thin!?". Another is "But IITians to kuchh bhi khaa lete hain naa" [But IITians can anyway eat anything right]. That gets tiring fast.You might be a food geek  if  as some others have suggested  you care about more than just the functional use of food. You care about knowing more about how it's made  possibly making it yourselves  about what goes into it and how the various ingredients contribute to the final taste  about possessing interesting tools  devices  utensils etc to help you in your cooking  and about the kinds of skills people who cook food professionally exhibit (I have spent way too much time staring at cooks deftly throwing dough into the air to roll it for Pizza bases or Rumali Roti  and at people chopping onions at blazing speed):https://youtu.be/0tpvNUH3KDI?t=5sSo  yes  there is more to being a food-geek than just wanting to eat food.
