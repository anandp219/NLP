Casual runners do not need very specialized gear  and you don't need access to fancy courts or other infrastructure. Feel like running? You can start today. You are rich? Doesn't matter. You are still gonna have to run yourself. Can't delegate it. This is also a kind of fund-raising activity that is not dependent on entry into elite social circles. Unlike  say  high-profile charity events. [Edit: it is true  though  that some marathon events tend to be very elitist and expensive for runners]Running  and the lead up to it when people train for it  promotes a culture of physical fitness.
