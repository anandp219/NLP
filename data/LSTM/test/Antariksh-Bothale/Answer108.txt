  I have written about this in the About section of my blog Linguistrix  so will cross-post relevant stuff here. There's also a lot of relevant fodder from my SoPs :)For someone who's deeply into Languages and Linguistics  I started rather late. Although my first experience with Linguistics was in Class VIII  when my English teacher taught me how to write the phonetic transcription for English words.I got to know of phonetics  learnt how sounds are produced  how stresses and intonation work in languages  and how the phonemic inventories of the world's languages were so different yet analyzable using the same tools.
