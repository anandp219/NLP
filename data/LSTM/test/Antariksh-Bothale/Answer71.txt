Height  for example is mostly measured in feet and inches even in India  and I find it more convenient than using the meters scale where most people would be between 1.5 and 2. Another example is temperature--the boiling point of water  no matter how important it is to Science  is of little consequence in every day life  especially since even temperatures lower than that are dangerous for humans. The freezing point calibration is more meaningful for people living in cold areas  but like another answer suggested  having a scale which uses the lowest and highest ambient temperatures you will experience as 0 and 100 anchors is pretty meaningful.
