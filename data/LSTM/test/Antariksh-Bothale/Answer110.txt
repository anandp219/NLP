I became a regular reader of LanguageLog  the world's best blog on linguistics  and have learnt a lot from the posts there and gotten exposed to a wide range of linguistic issues. I also read books like 'The Language Instinct' and 'The Atoms of Language'  which further piqued my curiosity.I also took an undergraduate course in linguistics  where I found myself in my element. Next  I took a course on Paninian Grammar  in which we studied the linguistic basis of ancient Sanskrit grammatical texts.I figured it'd be interesting to do something that combines my various interests  and Computational Linguistics seemed like a good option.
