  As others have written  while the term cottage cheese is commonly used to denote Paneer  there are slight differences in the way the two are made  and the ultimate difference from an end-product point of view is that paneer is pressed and comes out as a solid that can then be cut  while cottage cheese is wet and has loose curds which cannot be used the way paneer is used in Indian dishes. I've tried making palak paneer (paneer in a spinach gravy) using cottage cheese  and though I tried to strain the cheese  I still ended up with the cheese splitting and breaking down into tiny chunks and spreading all over the gravy.So what is the solution?
