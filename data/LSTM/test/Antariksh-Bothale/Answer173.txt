"Be a Man" is the kind of exhortation that is almost exclusively directed at boys and men  and is usually in response to displays of emotion or sentiment or 'weaknesses' which are considered fine when done by women. Note that this is unfair to both men and women. I am sure corollaries of the same can be found in cultures around the world. Hindi popular culture has a line Mard ko dard nahin hotaa (A real man doesn't feel pain). This kind of messaging is fairly pervasive in society. For instance  guys who cry are usually asked not to cry like (little) girls.
