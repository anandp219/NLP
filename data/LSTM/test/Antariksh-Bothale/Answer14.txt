When I was learning to walk  he'd make me count my footsteps in English as I climbed up the stairs. Mind you  all this happened when I was less than 6 years old  a period particularly facile for language acquisition. By the time I was 7  I could talk fairly comfortably in English for a non-native speaker  and since I grew up in a Hindi / Marathi household  I had native competence in the two languages.During all this  however  I was also reading Hindi (and occasionally Marathi) newspapers and books and comics and what not.
