  I thought about this myself when I first read Marina Keegan's thought-provoking article Even artichokes have doubts  but didn't find anything specific. Yesterday  I did a bit of searching again  and I think I have found the original source of the title  or rather  the source that the title seems to be alluding to. I think the title is a reference to a quote from the movie Amlie (Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amlie Poulain). The quote goes (Source: Amlie - Wikiquote):Vous au moins  vous ne risquez pas d'tre un lgume  puisque mme un artichaut a du cur.You couldn't even be a vegetable  even artichokes have a heart.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
