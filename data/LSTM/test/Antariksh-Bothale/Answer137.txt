  In general  when people talk loudly to foreigners  they also tend to speak slightly slowly or tend to pronounce words more carefully and clearly. These things definitely make it easier to understand a foreign language  especially since a lot of phonetic reductions that are natural for a fluent speaker are very unintuitive to a person who has limited knowledge of the language.Be very careful with this though. Loud  slow  directed speech  especially if combined with gestures  can come off as extremely condescending and rude  and gives the impression that you think the listener is stupid.Since the line between accommodating and condescending is not too difficult to step on  err slightly on the side of caution.
