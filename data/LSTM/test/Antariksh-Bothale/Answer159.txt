I grew up very technology literateused computers since I was 7 (this was in the 90s mind you; now kids are anyway born into computers; I am waiting for the first foetal selfie)  started learning programming at the age of 9  and in general  spent a lot of time tinkering with stuff.Since both my parents work  I've spent large amounts of time alone at home. To a large extent  they didn't police me around excessively and put unnecessary restrictions. To give you a very 90s example  we almost always had Cable TV at home while many other kids had it only during vacations.
