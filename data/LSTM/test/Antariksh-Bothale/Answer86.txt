If you frequently express disapproval of their activities (in some cases  your disapproval may be justified  but that doesn't matter)  they will probably just stop telling you about what they do. If it creates conflict or unnecessary headache or drama  it will be avoided. For instance  if your first reaction on hearing that your son has a girlfriend is one of anger (or worse: OMG! You have a girlfriend? No kissing! Get married soon! )  you are pretty much guaranteeing that your son will never talk to you about his love life.
