Before any big purchase  we always spent time researching our options and trying to ensure we were making a reasonable choice. The result is that I rarely make impulse purchasesthere's always a bit of 'due diligence'  so to speak.In the same vein  taught me financial triage by example. They didn't mind spending  but they tried to spend it on the right things. They spent on fairly expensive books (which  in today's money  might have costed  say  INR 3000-4000)  but would have probably cringed at spending the same money on a single night  eating out.MiscellaneousMaintained a largely peaceful environment at home.
