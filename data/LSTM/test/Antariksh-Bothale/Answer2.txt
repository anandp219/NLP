Visit: IIT Bombay Programmes.Apart from you branch  the bigger overall aspect that will affect your experience is of course your life on campus  and for everything about your next 4-5 years at IITB  from academics (or as we like to call itacads) to hostel life to Cultural (cult) and Technical (tech) activities... To give you a better insight into how life@IITB will be and how you can prepare better for your hostel stay  we initiated a "Freshmen Forum" back in 2010  which we hope will be as useful to you as it has been to the previous 5 batches of IIT entrants.Around 70% of all new entrants register on this forum.
