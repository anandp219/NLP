When you give people  such as the Westboro Baptist Church  a constitutional right  it tends to be viewed as an absolute  and isn't weighed against competing rights. I find that absurd.This concern could also be addressed  by explicitly stating in the bill of rights that rights are always to be considered in a broad context  and balanced against competing rights.In summary  I think that our Courts are actually quite good at protecting our rights  and they do so without having to consider the political consequences.
