  I have very positive feelings towards India. Ironically  I find the Indian government's actions in seeking to censor this documentary reflect far more negatively on India than this documentary did (which I have seen).By attempting to ban this documentary  the government is suggesting that:"Reputation" and "honour" are tangible things that it's acceptable to defendThe actions of third parties can damage reputation and honourDefending reputation and honour thus demand that such actions by third parties be prohibitedIsn't this precisely the thinking that the vast majority of people - including the vast majority of Indians  I presume - are fighting?
