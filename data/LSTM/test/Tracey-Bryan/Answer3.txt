Isn't this precisely the logic underlying honour killings  and the "she deserved it for being out at night with an unrelated male" responses to rape?India is a thriving  robust  liberal democracy. It can withstand close scrutiny  and to be defensive and try to shut down conversation and examination is highly unbecoming. It is action more suited to a dictatorial regime than the liberal democracy that is modern India.I felt the documentary actually presented India  overall  very positively. Despicable crimes such as this one also happen in western countries  and documentaries are made about those  too.
