Obviously that's not viable. (And clearly morally repugnant. )Do we force them to renounce their religion? I don't even know how that's possible. Do we introduce global laws illegalising the Quran  mosques  etc.? Is that the kind of world we want to live in  anyway?If we can't kill or convert them all  and Islamic terrorism is a problem that we want to address  can we do it without the 24%+ of the planet's population who are Muslim and not terrorists?We just can't. Further  how do you think the 24%+ are going to react to being labelled as complicit?
