I can't imagine any scheme other than self-identification making any sense  therefore it seems that changing ethnicity or race should be as simple as saying "I no longer identify as race A  I am race B"  and filling out any future paperwork consistently with that.Lest anybody thinks otherwise  I am not suggesting people should be obliged to do this  of course. Race only makes sense as self-identification  so people should not be obliged to be racially classified due to DNA or any factor other than self-identification.
