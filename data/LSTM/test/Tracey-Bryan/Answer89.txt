What an enormous waste of human and court resources  as a result of the inflexibility of incorporating it into the constitution.This concern can be addressed by having a legislative  rather than constitutional  bill of rights  and I'm "less opposed" to a legislative bill of rights than a constitutional one. Victoria  the ACT  and England have taken this path.AbsolutismPresently  Australian courts balance common law rights against other factors  such as the rights of other individuals  statutory law  common law precedents  international covenants  etc.
