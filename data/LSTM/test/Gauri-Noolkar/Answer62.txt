  I will try to answer this question with the story of a woman who completed her PhD recently.She was by no means privileged  but she had dreams which few women from her generation could relate to. She wanted to do a PhD long back  but the humdrum and duties of daily life neither allowed her nor motivated her to take that step. She was daughter-in-law to a struggling household  wife to an ailing husband  and mother to a young boy  while working as a professor in a nearby college. PhD went on the back burner.She finally did take it up.
