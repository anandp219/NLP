  Wrong by whose standards?Writing poetry is a form of expression  and if you write when you are upset  that might be your coping mechanism as well. I too write poems when I am upset and/or happy because of Gauri Noolkar's answer to Why do you write? or sometimes simply because Gauri Noolkar's answer to Why do you write poems?. Does writing poetry help you order your thoughts? Does it calm you down? Clear your head a little? Make you feel better?Or if nothing else  end up being a piece of literature?
