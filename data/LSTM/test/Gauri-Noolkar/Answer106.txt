  "Overrated" is your perception  so I won't go by that  but I can definitely share a thought or two about why he garners so much attention  involvement  and support among common folk - i.e. through the layman lens of viewing the Mahabharata.The soft corner for Karna begins with his birth - when his mother abandons him as an innocent  helpless baby in the clutches of a mighty river which had every chance of killing him. Coupled with the fact that he is the illustrious child of the Sun (an extremely revered entity in Hindu philosophy  religion and mythology)  Karna sets the perfect stage for a mixture of awe and tender sympathy right with his first breath of life.
