  I read this question just after I read an article in the news which spoke about how the Arab World was not stepping up to help their brethren  so I do not agree with your statement that no one is pointing fingers at them.Also  right since 2011  countries like Jordan and Lebanon (both Arab) have been taking in refugees right since the outset of the war. Earlier  they took in Iraqi refugees as well. And 0h  Palestinian refugees before that. Today  about 25% of Lebanon's population (a freakishly tiny country) is refugee.
