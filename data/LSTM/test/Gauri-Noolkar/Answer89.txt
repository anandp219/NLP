  Ishita Roy and Bala Senthil Kumar have given great answers  but I cannot resist answering even though my answer is on similar lines.In a single word  yes. Feminism directly challenges traditional family roles of women in the Indian society. It stands for everything family roles do not - individualism  independence  equality  self-responsibility  sexual empowerment to begin with - and directly contradicts what young girls and women are taught and generally expected to be.Feminism is a threat because it 'allow's women to simply use their brains.
