It does get hot in the afternoon though  and the evenings are breezy and pleasant. The cold sets in with the night  and you would not mind snuggling in a quilt all night long; it does get that cold.Well  I have been rambling enough  but yes  keep a muffler  gloves  socks and a sweater or two in your wardrobe if you are going to spend a winter in Pune.
