Join an airline  or the railways.I don't know what it takes to get there  but perhaps a course in aviation management? You can steer yourself towards being placed on the plane rather than at the airport.Also  you can join the railways. Hop in as a TC  or railroad engineer.3. Or become a pilot or a train operator.Some hard work and you can actually drive yourself to places.4. The Anthony Bourdain way.If you love travelling  you have surely heard of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. Again  I don't know what it takes  but you can surely earn by travelling and presenting new  offbeat places  or offbeat aspects of regular places to thousands of TV viewers every week.
