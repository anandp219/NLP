  I'll try to answer this with my own example.I got married at a very  very beautiful beach in a small  picturesque Maharashtrian village named Anjarle. The sun was out  the breeze was lovely  the sea clean and blue. Guests were few but fun  and food was delicious.do you spot the sea?To be honest  the idea of getting married at Anjarle was a decision which was not very popular at the beginning. It raised a lot of eyebrows and arguments  and if it weren't for my husband's determination  I would have found it extremely difficult to convince a whole bunch of people to let us tie the knot there.Why Anjarle?
