So  a) we are either late  orb) we break the traffic rules - signals  speed limits  one-way signs etc. - and make it on time.Following traffic rules do not allow us to 'fix' hence we break them.Further  commuting in India is one nerve-wrecking task. Indian cities and towns have hardly heard of urban planning; they have simply grown like a wild nettle bush. There is little logic to how roads appear  turn and blend into each other. Many of them are narrow and in extremely bad shape. To top it all  they are now packed with cars that grow larger and larger in size and number (making them seem narrower than ever)  and they can no longer sustain the ever-growing traffic which comprises of a chaotic motley of all sorts of vehicles  hawkers  people and animals.Wading through this chaos is difficult  stressful and time consuming  and the added woe are ill-designed traffic rules.
