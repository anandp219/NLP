Consider Boris Johnson on the zip-wire  for example  or President GW Bush being pecked by a pardoned turkey  or David Miliband with his banana. Those are such cracking moments in time they fairly deserve their moment in the sun  or in The Sun even.Does the story demand a more serious treatment? I would expect even the Daily Mirror to choose a reasonable shot of David Cameron to illustrate its VJ Day coverage  for example. It just wouldn't do to select an unflattering comedy shot to illustrate such a serious story.
