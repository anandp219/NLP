  As Franklin Veaux has pointed out  "telling your partner not to talk to other men is extremely crosses dive and controlling." I fully agree  but it seems from the wording of your question that you are merely telling your girlfriend you don't like it. And you're entitled to share that information.I sympathise with your plight. I would have no objection to my wife retaining cordial relations with her exes  but I think it's reasonable to put some distance with previous BFs/GFs upon entering a new monogamous relationship.
