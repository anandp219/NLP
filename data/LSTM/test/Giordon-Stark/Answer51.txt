This torque causes the dipole moment to rotate about its center in the electric field. Define the origin to be at the center of this rotation. [math]\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E} \qquad \left|\vec{\tau}\right| = p E \sin \phi[/math]Just to put in direction  let's say that the velocity [math]\vec{v}[/math] of the particles are in the [math]\hat{\phi}[/math] direction (positive = counter-clockwise). Then [math]\hat{\phi} = -\sin\phi \hat{x} + \cos\phi \hat{y}[/math].What happens if the magnetic field is in three configurations?
