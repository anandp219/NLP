  Living with Google Inbox  life is good.I'm probably one of the heaviest users of gmail I know. I adopted it rather early  and I have tended to be in beta access for many of the features. Let's just start with stats I took a few days agoSo yeah. I guess I know a thing or two about dealing with email. First  I now currently use Google Inbox and have almost fully migrated[1] from Gmail. See my post on Forbes which is of Reviews of: Inbox by Gmail.Note  I also use Google Chat a shitton. But remember that I'm deaf so I naturally like to just communicate by text rather than spending effort lipreading or understanding accents.
