And now  Google Inbox is the answer to my dreams  and more!See  emails flood in on an hourly basis for me. I talk with people all over the world in pretty much every timezone. There is no downtime for my email. Unlike Facebook  I know which emails I've read and responded to  and which ones I haven't gotten to. And I'm guaranteed not to miss anything. I dislike emails that stay at the top  such as in gmail with the "Important"  "Unread"  or splitting it up into separate categories. For me  this is terrible.
