Tier 0 distributes the raw data and the reconstructed output to Tier 1s  and reprocesses data when the LHC is not running.Tier 1 consists of 13 computer centres (table 1) large enough to store LHC data. They provide round-the-clock support for the Grid  and are responsible for storing a proportional share of raw and reconstructed data  as well as performing large-scale reprocessing and storing the corresponding output; distributing data to Tier 2s; and storing a share of the simulated data that the Tier 2s produce.
