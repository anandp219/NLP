  There are three cases to consider with this electric dipole in fields. First  let's just deal with treating the whole thing in 2D and only talk about an electric field. What happens to the dipole? It undergoes a torque.We have an electric dipole of [math]\vec{p}[/math] with the two charges separated by [math]d[/math] in a uniform electric field [math]\vec{E}[/math]. Now  if it's at an angle [math]\theta[/math] with respect to the electric field  then this will feel a torque [math]\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}[/math].
