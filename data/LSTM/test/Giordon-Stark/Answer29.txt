The rule of thumb on data size per event is [math] 1 \text{ event} \approx 1 \text{ MB}[/math] [7]which is 40 terabytes per second of data coming in. PER. SECOND. This is a lot of information  and we would fill up a single petabyte in about half a minute. It is impossible for us to record all that information. So we need to filter events at the same rate at which they come in. This is where the levels come in. I made the following cartoon to highlight the overall system summarized from the Level-1 Technical Data Report (L1TDR)[6].To make this clear  imagine that water flows through the system from top to bottom.
