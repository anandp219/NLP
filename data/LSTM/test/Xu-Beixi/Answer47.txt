  Please don't do it.The problem with these 'pranks' is that they can always go horribly wrong. In the best case scenario  the owner laughs along with you  everything's forgiven. In the worst case scenario  you're savaged by their dogs  beaten with your own sign  and slapped with litigation (to add to trespassing on private property  there's emotional distress  harassment  etc. )- and the other problem is that nearly no passersby will take your side when they realize what you're doing.Ultimately  it's up to you.
