I was also in a special high-school with a great deal of stress; my white-haired days have yet to begin. However  your water intake  diet  and lifestyle can contribute to your hair graying. If you don't take care of yourself or give yourself nutritious food and nourishment during those periods of exam stress and late nights  your body will get you back for that (please see: Page on gaizupath.com for the source).Thanks for the A2A!Footnotes: your hair is coloured thanks to melanocytes (see brown squiggly things at the bottom); your hair goes grey when they can no longer produce their pigment.
