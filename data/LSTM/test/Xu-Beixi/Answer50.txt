Whenever I've approached strangers in public for no apparent reason (to them)- they would look quite lost for a second  and their features would transform into one of gratitude when they understood what was going on.However  you're asking two different things here- correcting an objective wardrobe malfunction (fly down  dress unzipped  tp stuck on shoes) is one thing  correcting a subjective one (unbuttoned top button  off-the-shoulder top) is quite different. In the latter  it is typically assumed the wearer intended it as such  and should be left alone.
