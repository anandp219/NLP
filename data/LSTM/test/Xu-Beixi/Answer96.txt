I read a thoughtful comment on dlisted that was lovely food for thought:As I've gotten older I've found that I'm no longer fixed on a "type." It's more or less an affinity for a set of traits  or a combination of habits  values  and behaviors. There's no formula  no equation  no requirement  even. The range of who and what I enjoy watching and interacting with has broadened  while at the same time I find myself looking at the "hot" guys and going... "ew." Don't get me wrong  looks can  and do  factor in.
