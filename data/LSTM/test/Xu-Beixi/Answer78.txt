  A lifetime ago (i.e. 3 years back)  I attended the Singapore Airlines interview in hopes of landing a job as an air stewardess. The main reason being  my father had wanted me to see the world- just not on his dime. It was held in the lobby of the Sheraton  and took up nearly the entire second floor of it. Hundreds of young men and women lining up  snaking queues  and endless anxious faces. It was almost like a really hip club- you had to wait in line to do everything  everyone was dressed their best  and nobody looked like they were enjoying themselves to any degree.
