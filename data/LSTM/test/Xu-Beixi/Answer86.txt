As a start  I hope to recommend The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love  Character  and Achievement: David Brooks: 9780812979374: Amazon.com: Books and Stumbling on Happiness. It helps us understand certain decision making tools we have  why they're flawed  and what you can do. Should be available in any decent library. Good luck out there!
