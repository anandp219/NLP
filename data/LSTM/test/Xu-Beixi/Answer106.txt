  I'm afraid I don't know until we have a look at you in person. It could be anything ranging from entirely normal to serious  without answering a few questions.Can you describe these projections? How do they feel? What colour are they? How many?How high?Is there pain/aching/soreness in the spot?Are they bleeding?How long have you had them?Are there any other symptoms?Say  abnormalities in bodily functions- your appetite  your urine  your bowel movement  your sleeping patterns  temperature  and so forth.
