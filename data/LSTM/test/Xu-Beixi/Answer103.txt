Having fun is good and all  but who takes care of you when you're sick? Who do you tell everything to? Who waits up for you when you're not home at night? :/ Doesn't it ever get soul-crushingly lonely? And who will help raise your kids (should you ever have any)? What happens when you get old? The behavior that was carefree and breezy in our youth can turn stale and trite in middle age  alas.I think we are wired for relationships. We are social animals. We are all about relationships  romantic or otherwise  and the quality of them will determine the quality of our entire lives.
