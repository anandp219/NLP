Going through an experience like that makes one lose track of how many different people are asking the questions. It starts to feel like the same person is asking the same question.

Wouldn't you want to throw this journalist through a window?https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sj...The same thing happens here on Quora - on a much smaller scale - We get asked the same questions over and over and over.
