He became as good a friend  as good a master  and as good a man  as the good old city knew  or any other good old city  town  or borough  in the good old world. "That leaves us to either assume the omniscient narrator is referring to the future or the story takes place far enough in the past that Ebenezer could become a better man before the story was told.
