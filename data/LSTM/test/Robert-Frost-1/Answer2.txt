  I don't believe he is negative about the films. To the contrary  he has been quite positive. He has repeatedly praised Sam Mendes work as director on Spectre and Skyfall. He has repeatedly said how grateful he is for the quality of the script in Casino Royale that allowed him to be Bond  rather than just impersonate past Bonds.Any negative remarks he has made have been about the exhausting process of making the films. They are massive films that put a lot of pressure on the star. They are physically demanding films that strain the body - work on Spectre had to cease for a few weeks while he had knee surgery after an on-set injury.
