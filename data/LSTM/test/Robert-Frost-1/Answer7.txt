  More than two dozen. From the 1901 silent film called Scrooge  or  Marley's Ghost to the 2009 full CGI 3D Jim Carrey version  A Christmas Carol is adapted for film  television  and stage perennially.I believe that the best version is the 1984 version  starring George C. Scott  David Warner  Susannah York  Roger Rees  and Edward Woodward. In addition to the strong performances from such a stellar cast  it is the version that I believe is most true both to the spirit and the setting of the film.
