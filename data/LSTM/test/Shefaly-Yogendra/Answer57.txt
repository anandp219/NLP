  The answer below addresses the headline question  and not the question details which have been addressed by a couple other answers. The human pre-frontal cortex - which regulates impulse control  attention  logical and organised thinking  risk management etc - doesn't develop till a child is much older (and continues to develop till around age 25). This means that kids are operating from a relatively primitively equipped brain - namely  in neonate and younger kids  the reptilian brain (which helps basic functions such as breathing  eating  pooping  sleeping etc) and in older kids  the limbic brain (which starts developing after birth  and is essential for survival hence feelings like fear  pleasure  danger monitoring etc).
