  Many Indian homes and a few British homes have staff that bring them tea or coffee in the morning. These are paid domestic staff so effectively these people are paying someone to bring their coffee in the mornings. Many people's partners or spouses bring them tea or coffee in the morning. I know this from friends as well as from reading "my weekend" type columns appearing in the FT How To Spend It magazine or other weekend magazines. I believe these people aren't paying for their tea or coffee in the morning.Personally I wouldn't pay for anyone to bring me coffee in the morning.
