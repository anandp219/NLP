Then mix it vigorously with a widely held and internalised belief in the cycle of birth and death  and the form of life/ quality of life being an outcome of the previous birth's actions.The result is a society that despises  hides  discards its disabled. They are deemed inferior  with their disability - stupidly enough - attributed to bad kismet or sins of the last birth or some equally indefensible idea. Is that wise? Of course not. It could happen to any of us -- an idea we don't entertain at all as I wrote in my answer linked above.
