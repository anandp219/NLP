  A friend of mine went from a Philosophy and English literature degree  straight to work in investment banking. He was about 21  not sure what he wanted to do and the investment bank  hiring at his top notch university  didn't think philosophy a hindrance to investment banking. Several years later  he told me he found his ability to abstract things quickly very helpful in understanding concepts and agendas behind specific decisions and actions  but he also couldn't shake the feeling that there wasn't much meaning or value being created from his work.
