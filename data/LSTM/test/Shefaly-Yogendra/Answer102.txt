On the flip side  such experience is not likely to be valued by those  who bring narrow criteria of age and associated prejudices to the process of engaging with such hugely experienced people. None of these persons sends a CV or a written communique to anyone  outlining their own wonderfulness. The younger people  whom they mentor and advise  such as me  do the job for them. We bring ideas and opportunities to them  for feedback  validation  advice and sometimes a request to engage in a formal capacity.
