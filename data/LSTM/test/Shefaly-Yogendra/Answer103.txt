I learnt from them and I am practising it as I myself get nearer the 25-year experience mark  that beyond a point  the CV matters but a little  but what matters more is the people  who are in your network and who are your true social capital. These people are the true champions of your brand  your experience  your wonderfulness as a mentor and advisor and executive. My glib-sounding advice here would be if some one is judging you instantly as being pass just because of your age  you are talking to the wrong people.
