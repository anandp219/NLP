  Bitter tastes such as that of coffee and alcohol are indeed acquired tastes. As babies  we like sweet  rejecting many other tastes such as sour (ever watch a little kid's face after her first taste of a drop of lemon juice? ).A combination of how we develop and mature  experiences we have  the sort of social example we see  the "reward" properties of some foods  and our own genetics then shape our acquiring - or not - of other tastes. As we grow  we experience more foods and tastes. If the family and social context is  say  experimental and open minded  one might try more things and decide like/ dislike preferences.
