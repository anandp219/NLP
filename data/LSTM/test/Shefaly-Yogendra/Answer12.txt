When a name is attached  an OP is forced to word the question carefully. His or her edit record is available for us all to see if the rap sheet is clean or if this is a habitual offender. If the OP feels  he or she can defend his or her intent in question details. Many of us are more likely to answer the questions if we don't feel it is a troll. 2. The "snowflake" syndrome needs to be quashed not encouraged. In other words  OP of such questions needs to look more at older questions -- if indeed he or she is coming from the genuine intent of learning rather than idle trolling -- before posting.
