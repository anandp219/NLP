  Excerpted from my answer to a similar question Shefaly Yogendra's answer to How can I overcome loneliness as a foreigner?I empathise with your experience. I have been a "foreigner" in many countries but several times in my own vast diverse complicated country too. I write the following based on my experience. Are you there by choice? Then you are in luck. You are in control of what you choose to experience and how  without needing to spend energy on blaming someone else for dumping you in what looks like an alien space.
