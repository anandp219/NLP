  Apple seems to have a formulaic approach of rejecting ideas  and then later pursuing them that goes something along the lines of:a) We are doing X.b) If someone asks them about Y  possibly adjacent to X  the answer is "People don't want Y for reasons A  B & C."c) When they come out with their own Y  they say "Y has never been done right  and we're changing that today".Other companies follow similar patterns  but given it's reputation for great products  Apple in particular sends a different message when it really does enter a space.
