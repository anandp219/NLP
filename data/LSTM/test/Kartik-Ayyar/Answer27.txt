( I had this happen to me on a deserted offramp ). I wish there was also some learning or early warning that was based on Tesla using it's mapping data based on routes you drive often around where lines are weak.This is a nitpick  though I get the impression it tends to keep constant distance from the lane line to your left rather than aligning itself in the middle of two lanes.Thanks Tesla for making such an awesome feature.
