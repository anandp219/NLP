  Imagine for a second that Computer science is a forest.So even though on a day to day basis often you're hacking away at trees to make further progress as a programmer  it's easy to appreciate how having a map will orient you to make good strategic decisions further down the road.The CS degree is not there to tell you how pick up the day to day vocational and domain specific aspects of the job. It is there to give you a framework to make decisions when you come to a fork in the road.Finally  in my experience  even some of the most seemingly obscure classes that I took that I felt were fun but had no value have come in handy in times of need.
