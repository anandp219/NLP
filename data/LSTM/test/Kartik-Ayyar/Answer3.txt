  My picks would be:Education: There is far more demand than supply when it comes to avenues for quality education.Health: Life expectancy in India is 66 years. This is far below that of developed countries.Infrastructure: There are frequent power cuts  water can sometimes be scarce  and roads are jam packed. There is no notion of lane driving. There has already been some great progress with the creation of public transportation services like the Delhi Metro. An american friend of mine visiting Delhi felt it was already better than Bart  though there is still a long way to go.
