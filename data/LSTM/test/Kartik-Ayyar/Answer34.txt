Or for that matter Pixar. I would have expected at least some of that.If it were a pure work of fiction  I might have liked this movie - the acting is really quite good. I expected authenticity  and I did not feel I got that  which is what broke it for me.I really enjoyed The Social Network  and felt if this movie had a similar vibe  I'd like it too.However  I came out feeling disappointed.
