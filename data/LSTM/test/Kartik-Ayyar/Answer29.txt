There are concurrency  reliability and memory hierarchy friendliness issues that are very complex  and rarely captured well in textbooks.There might be some overlap with some of this material and a databases or OS class  but in those classes the algorithmic analysis is not that rigorous.So if I could have one feature request for the next book  it would be that there be a lot more additional material focused on persistent data structures.Update on what to remove:If I had to pick I'd vote for sorting networks  linear programming  FFT and computational geometry.
