  Yesterday I was at the mall when I saw a Tarot Card booth that was owned by two ladies. Well  I sat down and she told me to pick five cards and to ask a question. I asked  "When will I start walking?" She told me that she won't be able to give me the exact time but she'll give me whatever message the cards show her. I picked out five cards and almost immediately she said  "You worry too much. You need to stop thinking and worrying about your future. Sometimes things are meant to happen more quickly  but by doubting yourself and thinking too many negative things  like asking yourself 'what if' questions  you're promoting negative energy to enter your heart and mind  which causes the positivity to lessen and eventually  it disappears."
