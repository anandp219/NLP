  Here's the thing: Indians have populated the majority of Quora  that's a known fact. There are a couple of things that irk me  which I'd like to mention. There are users on here (not particularly Indian) that ask troll questions  simple questions that can be Googled  questions that are demaning and sexist (which are very  very hurtful and controversial)  and ask questions before checking for similar questions. There are also those who write troll answers; the reason I say that the majority of such offences are Indians is because if you check the "collapsed answers"  it's mostly filled with collapsed answers of Indians.
