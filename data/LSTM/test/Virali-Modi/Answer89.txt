I was also put on a strict diet which  in retrospect  wasn't really healthy. The people there knew no English  which made it hard for me to communicate with them  because I couldn't speak Hindi. The treatment didn't help me at all. It was a failure  I saw no improvements  even when I continued the medicines at home for over a year.During that year  I also underwent another treatment which was kind of the same  but the men that would massage my legs  would come home. The oil was a mixture of herbs  oils  and seeds  which smelt horrible.
