My mom constantly saw my long face everyday and would ask me why I was upset  but I couldn't tell her.When I finally did  she was upset with me. She shouted  because drinking at such a young age was really unheard of in my family. To be honest  it was stupid of me to do that. After all the waterworks were done  she gave me some advice and I implemented it. Guess what? The rumors died off.That's when she told me  "People in this world are just waiting for a reason to talk about you  put you down  and to hurt you.
