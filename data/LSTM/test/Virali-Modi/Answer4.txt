  The disability has nothing to do with it. What's important is how you are around people. I have friends that are wheelchair bound  whom aren't that good looking (according to me)  but have a lively personality and are incredibly confident with who they are. They have girlfriends who are able to walk  and got into a relationship after the person was on a wheelchair.Your looks don't matter up to an extent  what matters is your personality  how confident you are  and your ability to get along with the opposite sex.
