  I don't think there's an age limit to anything. According to me  you can be sixty years old and party like a college student; at the same time  you can be the same age and study as much as you want to achieve a degree. I think society puts the pressure on us to have our lives figured out by the age of thirty  but that's just not possible. At thirty  that's when our lives are truly starting. We're able to focus on our goals and aspirations  and we can make them reality. Life isn't about going to college  getting a degree  getting a job  and earning money.
