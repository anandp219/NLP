  No.Everything up until I came out of my coma is still hazy. I don't remember much or anything at all  to be completely honest. I don't remember as vividly as other memories of how I became sick [1]. I don't remember when  how  or why I became comatose. All I do remember is the dream [2] I had during those twenty-three days. The dream I had was what was happening to my body at that exact moment.I don't know if this is the case with all coma patients  but my memory was greatly affected. I still have trouble remembering things.
