I always wanted to hear the stories of my followers  how my answers helped change them  what they did different than me  how they motivated someone in their life. Unfortunately  that hasn't happened yet.To be honest  it's totally okay that I'm famous on Quora yet I'm not widely recognized in real life. I suppose I get my privacy this way. On the bright side  I usually end up in tears when I read messages from my followers; at least I won't be crying in front of them.
