  Just this year when I went to Zimbabwe for my boyfriend's sister's wedding  I was shunned by all of the kids my age. Apparently some of the elders were talking trash about me to his parents. They were saying stuff about me being on a wheelchair  about me influencing Dhyaan (my boyfriend) to leave his parents  and other bad stuff which I don't want to share. Dhyaan's cousins started creating drama too. They'd leave me alone and go out for lunch  they'd play games and wouldn't include me  just really childish things.
