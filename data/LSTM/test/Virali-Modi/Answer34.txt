For a quick bun  I gather my hair into a ponytail in my hand  then I twist the hair and loop it around itself on my head and use a hair tie to fasten it. It literally takes one minute.4. For extremely soft feet and hands  I apply a heavy duty moisturizer for dry skin and enclose my feet in thick socks over night. The next morning  I'm left with soft feet and hands. If you don't have a heavy duty moisturizer  vaseline works too.5. For an inexpensive makeup remover  I use baby oil to remove my eye makeup.
