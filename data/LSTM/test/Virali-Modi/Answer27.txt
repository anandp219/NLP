Dhyaan taught me about the African culture  things I never thought I'd get to learn and experience; but because of him  I did. I traveled to Zimbabwe in May (2015) too see him and crossed off another country on the map.Dhyaan especially has always been so supportive and loving. He's supported me in everything and anything that I've ever wanted to do. He's helped me with therapy and exercises  he got me motivated to start going to the gym  and he's actually gotten me to eat healthy food (which I'm not a fan of).All I can say is that  I took a big step especially after knowing how horribly my ex-fianc treated me.
