Well  I've been doing that for the past week now  and it seems to be working. One of the friends from the group has started talking to me whenever she and I would cross paths.If you think you're right  ignore them and live your life as if it doesn't matter if they're ignoring your or not. If you're wrong  apologize once  but if they still have the audacity to ignore you after an apology  you should ignore them too.
