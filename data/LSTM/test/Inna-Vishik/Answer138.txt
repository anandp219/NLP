If we have learned anything about superconductivity in the 58 years after BCS theory explained the mechanism for one class off superconductors  we have learned that superconductivity is a very common ground state for materials to assume. Many materials have been discovered which would not have been predicted to be superconductors by BCS theory  so there are likely multiple pathways for achieving superconductivity  just like there are multiple ways to make a magnet. With material and mechanism space wide open  a much higher Tc is possible.
