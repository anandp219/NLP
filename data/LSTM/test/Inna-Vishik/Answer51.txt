Helium makes up almost a quarter of the mass in our universe  and it is found in abundance in our sun and in gaseous planets in our solar system. Additionally  there is some quantity on the moon. However  this does NOT mean that it is practical with today's  tomorrow's  and next century's technology to extract helium from these extraterrestrial sources and bring it back to earth. In the rest of the answer  I will primarily make reference to lunar mining for the obvious reason that it is over 1000 times closer to the earth than Jupiter is.see also: Inna Vishik's answer to Are we really running out of helium?Helium-4These days  liquid helium-4 cost ~$1000 for 100L  and this amount of helium might keep a physics experiment at 4.2K for one week.
