  Yes  it is possible to get admitted to a PhD program without a physics major  though it is perhaps more difficult. The biggest stumbling block is convincing the committee that you have the same knowledge base  because graduate core classes are not of introductory nature: they assume a prerequisite undergraduate course. The question details indicate that you are a ChemE major. If your ChemE curriculum was like my undergrad friends'  it included courses in quantum mechanics  statistical mechanics  and electromagnetism.
