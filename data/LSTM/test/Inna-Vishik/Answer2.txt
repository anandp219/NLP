  Helium is a relatively scarce and non-renewable resource on earth. In addition  it has many uses in industry and in research  some of which cannot substitute something else for helium  so there is a large (inelastic) demand for this scarce resource. These three factors conspire to make it expensive (~$15/Liter (125 grams) for liquid helium in the US).Scarce:Terrestrial helium is almost solely a biproduct of uranium and thorium fission. These elements are not very abundant on earth (see: Abundance of the chemical elements) Helium is extracted from the earth through natural gas mining  where it typically constitutes only a small percentage (<5%) of the gas in the mine.
