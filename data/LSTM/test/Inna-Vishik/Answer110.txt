Thus  when one knows the energy of a process  they can assign a timescale to it which is inversely proportional  based on this uncertainty. The relevant energy in the first step is the energy of the photon  which can vary by many orders of magnitude. For the sake of argument  lets pick something on the low end  say 10 electron volts (eV). This corresponds to a timescale ([math]t=h/E[/math]  using planck's constant  h  in appropriate units) of 0.4 femtoseconds (fs). Step 3: I am going out of order here because this step is similar to 1.
