What did piss me off about the women's races I have participated in outside of NWM (and all this was in the bay area  so it may be a regional problem) is that 1) there was an overemphasis on praising mediocre accomplishments  like participating in the first place (is the implication that women are like elementary school children and need to be patted on the head and encouraged at every step?) and 2) the field was not very competitive  even by recreational-runner standards (which is probably related to point 1).This is not to say that all women-focused races suffer from the ills described above.
