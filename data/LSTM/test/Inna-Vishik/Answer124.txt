  Answering the question itself (not the details): yes  it is possible to change the color of a material gradually and permanently by applying a voltage  and the mechanism I am thinking of is ion conduction.There are materials called 'solid electrolytes' (see Fast ion conductor) which conduct ions  but not electricity  when a voltage is applied. Ions move by hopping from void to void in the crystal structure  and an applied voltage (and possibly an increased temperature) give a portion of the ions sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier for this process.
