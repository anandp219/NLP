After the deadline related to your PhD research passes  you can try to work shorter days and spend more time on your novel for a fixed period of time.DeadlinesPressure makes diamonds  and sometimes peoples can only be productive if they have a pressing date on which they need to have something to show for their work. PhD research naturally has deadlines (sometimes soft ones) in the form of presentations  papers  applications  referee reports  and the start/end of a semester. If you don't have enough of these to make you productive  you might consider making new ones  such as volunteering to give a presentation at a student journal club or setting up a meeting with someone important that you need to be prepared for.
