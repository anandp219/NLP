  White light (a.k.a. continuum) generation is a nonlinear optical process which can happen when ultrafast pulses of laser light propagate through certain media (examples of such media can be seen/purchased here).The first ingredient of white light generation is the Kerr effect  which causes the index of refraction to be different depending on the intensity of light ([math]n=n_0+n_K I[/math]). A focused pulsed laser has intensity which is variable in space (as any beam would if it is focused to a small spot) and also in time.
