The capacitance relates the amount of charge accumulated on the plates to the voltage between them: [math]C=Q/V[/math]. The position sensitivity comes from having a grid of parallel plate capacitors on the screen  and you can see this grid when you tilt your phone at certain angles in the correct light.Most modern touch screens work by modulating the charge on the plate  not by changing the distance between the plates. You can tell this is the case by trying to use your smartphone while wearing gloves: it simply won't work unless your gloves have conductive thread in the fingertips.
