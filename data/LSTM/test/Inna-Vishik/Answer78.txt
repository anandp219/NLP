If the 'difficult' problems are really just standard derivations in a later course  this unfairly advantages people who happened to read the more advanced textbook and/or bring it to an open book exam.Thus  arguments can be made favoring both 'impossible' exams and 'challenging but doable' exams. For service courses which are intended for people of all majors  it should probably lean towards the latter. For advanced courses for people in the major  it is probably better to leave this to the discretion of the professor.
