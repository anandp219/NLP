It should be noted that vibration isolation is not always a money sink. For some types of experiments  it is sufficient to just build the STM on a floating table in a lab space which is situated on the buildings' foundation (basement if there is one  first floor if there isn't). For more extreme vibration isolation  one needs to float the entire lab floor on which the STM sits (plus one or two more vibration isolation systems on top of that)  which quickly escalates costs. In addition  an STM experiment which requires that much vibration isolation is likely to be operated at very low temperatures  so throw a dilution refrigerator on top of that.
