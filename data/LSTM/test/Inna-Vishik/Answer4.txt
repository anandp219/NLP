While there are theoretically other ways to cool something to very low temperatures  these alternate methods are not an appropriate substitute for every situation because of space  vibration  durability  magnetic field  and other concerns.Hospital MRI machines and the semiconductor industry also make extensive use of helium.The only factor that diminishes the cost of helium is that it is non-reactive so it can be recycled indefinitely.
