*High temperature superconductivity in research-speak refers to two specific materials systems: cuprate high temperature superconductors (which superconduct above liquid nitrogen temperature) and iron-based superconductors (which superconduct below liquid nitrogen temperature  but above 30K). The highest superconducting transition temperature ever is in H2S under high pressure (203K). This is not discussed in the context of high-Tc because 1) it was discovered last year and our language has already been solidified 2) it's mechanism is understood (it is a conventional BCS superconductor).
