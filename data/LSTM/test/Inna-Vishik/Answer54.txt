In low-temperature physics  He-3 is required in order to reach the lowest temperatures currently possible for bulk solids--down to milliKelvin temperatures. It also has potential as a fuel for nuclear fusion. He-3 costs over $2000 per liter (note that I quoted the price for He-4 per 100L)   but much smaller quantities are needed than of He-4  excluding the possibility that fusion applications become more ubiquitous one day. In recent years  only ~8kg per year were used in the US. He-3 is more common in the moon's crust than it is on earth (see: lunarnetworks.blogspot.in).
