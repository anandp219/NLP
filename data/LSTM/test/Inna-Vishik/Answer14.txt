  Floating tables are used to damp vibrations for precision optics and microscopy setups and have several levels of vibration isolation.First  the tabletop itself is very stiff and heavy. This limits small deformations and also produces a resonance frequency which is (hopefully) higher than vibrating components on the table.The second line of vibration isolation is 'floating' the table on four pneumatic legs (air pistons) which resist high frequency motion by producing an effective viscous impediment.
