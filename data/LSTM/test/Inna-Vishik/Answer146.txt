See: Zhun-Yong Ong's answer to Physics: Why do scientists crave to reach the absolute zero?Many experiments use cryostats designed to be operated with liquid helium (to study those materials which don't do anything above liquid nitrogen temperature)  and it is often non-trivial to operate these machines with a different cryogen.So how much liquid helium do researchers use to study high-Tc? This is highly variable. As I discussed at the end of this answer  there are two general types of cryostats (excluding mechanical cryocoolers): a bath cryostat where the sample is in thermal contact with a bath of liquid helium (surrounded by a vacuum jacket and a liquid nitrogen jacket; so if an experiment uses a bath cryostat  it will require liquid nitrogen  perhaps 100L per week of cold operation) and a flow cryostat where the sample is in contact with cold helium gas.
