The use of a Westboro Baptist Church expy was interesting in that they are a group that are equally hated by both the politically left and right. The former for their social views and the latter for their anti-military protests. However  there was absolutely no setup for the congregation to be killed. None of the members are introduced before the scene. The preacher wasn't in cahoots with the villain. The audience was simply given a minute or setup to let us know these were despicable people before Galahad went on his murder orgy.
