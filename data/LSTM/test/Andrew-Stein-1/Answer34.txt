  As opposed to armor-like hides or razor sharp claws  human beings' evolved to be social animals. Our survival depends on conforming and cooperating with group(s) in order to do things like split up labor into smaller tasks  taking down larger animals  etc. For the vast majority of our existence  an individual's survival depended on being part of a group  pack  tribe  etc. Exile and isolation lead to death. Thus  we evolved instincts and behaviors that let us conform to groups in order to keep from disrupting cohesion in the group.
