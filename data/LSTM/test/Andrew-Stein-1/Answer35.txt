For example  our brains evolved to make use of Heuristics in judgment and decision-making. These are essentially shortcuts that allow us to make quick (if sometimes inaccurate decisions.) These can take the form of Cognitive biases  many of which are geared toward making decisions that conform to pleasing your group. One of the more well-known examples of this is Groupthink. In order to maintain cohesion  group members tend to strive toward consensus  even if the consensus is "wrong." Groupthink is driven by our instinctual need to be seen as a positive member of the group to avoid being cast out.
