People are busy and the fact that they are showing up to your presentation shows that there is interest in your topic. Why are they coming to hear you speak? Why do they care? Give the audience what they came for. People have showed up for a reason. Keep that in mind. Tell the audience clearly why you are there  and why you are excited to speak to them. People respond to passion and conviction. Speak to what is relevant to them  and tell them why you believe it is relevant for them. If you've been given an open mic  and really don't know what to speak about  people are generally interested in topics like the following:Making money & getting richImproving productivity & saving timeBecoming more attractive & well likedInteresting stories & antidotes about celebrities (depending upon your audience can be entertainers  politicians  sports stars  etc)What now?
