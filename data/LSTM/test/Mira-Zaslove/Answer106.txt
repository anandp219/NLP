Ben Carson  from House Martel  is too far from Westeros to seriously take on the stronger Houses. He has separated siamese twins  "Unbowed  Unbent  Unbroken." But it's nearly impossible for someone without any elected political experience to actually win the presidency of the United States in 2016. Carly Florina  has the "Fire and Blood" of the Targareons. She  like the Mother of Dragons  is an excellent marketer  public speaker  and debater. On the grand stage  she shines. And brightly. Yet  she too  is an inexperienced leader and the results of her actions fail to live up to her grand and bold promises.
