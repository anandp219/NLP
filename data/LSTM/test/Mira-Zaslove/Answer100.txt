Many of my American friends lived with a romantic partner before getting married. And in India  this is rare  and if done  likely a secret from their family.People tend to be more sexually open  and provocative dress is also more culturally accepted in the US  and even moreso in parts of Europe. A middle aged or older Indian coming to an American beach could get a culture shock  where most American & European women feel totally comfortable in bikini or even topless.
