  Getting what you want is difficult. And at times  it seems random. Have you ever noticed that the most successful people you know aren't always the smartest? They aren't always the ones you expected to succeed.From my experience  the people who get what they want are the most determined  and follow a similar pattern. To lay your hands on your dream:1. Know what you wantNot knowing exactly what you want  is what makes life complicated. The paradox of choice. To gain focus  you need to select a clear and tangible goal because the more you dream about  the more you lack focus.
