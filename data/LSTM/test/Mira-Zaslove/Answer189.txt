Giving birth is like running a marathon. The body is exhausted and needs fuel. After delivery  I was starving and couldn't get the calories fast enough. Between that  and the breast-feeding  by the end of week 2  my swelling had gone down and I had lost about 20 lbs since giving birth. And I wasn't eating all that healthy. I craved  and devoured  donuts. Another good tip: get a postpartum support wrap. My sister-in-law who got back to her super svelte pre-baby weight  recommended wearing one. I got one and put it on when I left the hospital.
