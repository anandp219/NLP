But House Clinton is too fierce. They are battle trained  prepared  and their troops are in it to win it. At all costs. They have the money  experience  and political strength to defeat everyone else in the race right now. Clinton knows that "Winter is Coming" and like House Stark  is incredibly prepared. While I am excited for the first woman president  her gender has very little to do with her chances in 2016. She is just the best candidate in this race. The competition is simply too far behind.
