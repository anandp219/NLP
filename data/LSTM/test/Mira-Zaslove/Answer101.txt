  The 2016 election is still over a year away  but Hilary Clinton is going to win it. The only way she loses at this point is if something catastrophic goes wrong for her  most likely with her health. And she's looking pretty healthy. There are no more skeletons to be found in her closet-- only glorious red  white  and blue pantsuits. American politics is like "A Game of Thrones" and the strongest house will sit atop the Iron Thrown. It is true that Hilary Clinton is not very well liked and many of the american people don't trust her.
