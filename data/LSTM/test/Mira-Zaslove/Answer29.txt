He deserves the moniker  but not because of his IQ alone. Plenty of people  and possibly even some of Einstein's descendants  have similar levels of IQ. But few people  and none of his descendants (so far)  have made as much of an impact. There remains only one Albert Einstein. Throughout his life  Einstein proclaimed that  "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." He also was at the right place at the right time. World War II  the Manhattan Project and the push to create the bomb placed enormous emphasis on physics.
