Diamonds measure around 10. You can probably leave a bite mark if you bite really hard into 24 carat gold. This softness makes gold easy to work with  but other alloys need to be added to make more durable jewelry. Typically  Silver  Copper  Nickel  Tin  Palladium  Zinc and Manganese are added to non-24 karat "Gold" jewelry.Personal preference depends a lot on the desired color  price  durability  and also allergies. Many people are allergic to alloys (commonly Nickel) and cannot wear lower quality "gold" without breaking out in rashes.
