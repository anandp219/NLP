And by that point you're well into the sleep deprivation era of caring for a newborn that you don't care about fitting into anything other than yoga pants. The more weight you gain while pregnant  the more likely you'll keep on pounds after delivery. However  I do have a super fit friend who gained 80 lbs during pregnancy and lost all of it within a year. She credits weight lifting and lots of gym time. So  certainly how much and how you exercise  after giving birth is a big factor. If your goal is to keep the weight down after pregnancy  get into good shape before getting pregnant.
