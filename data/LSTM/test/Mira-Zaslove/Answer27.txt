Yet  Martin likely has more important reasons behind Jon Snows betrayal. Jon is not dead. He will be back  and will play a critical role in the war against the White Walkers. The Iron Islands credo applies : What is dead may never die  but rises again  harder and stronger. To this point Jon has been a little too trusting and incautious.

And to do that  he needs to leave the Nights Watch.
