Cut out anything that doesn't directly pertain to them. For example  if you are giving a talk on black holes  the topic for a general audience will be high-level and basic: "What is a black hole?" If you are giving a talk to astrophysics your talk will be more specific and topical  like: "Is there a black hole at the center of every galaxy? "People have short attention spans  even during a 10 minute presentation. Stick only to what is important to your specific audience.Why are you giving the presentation?
