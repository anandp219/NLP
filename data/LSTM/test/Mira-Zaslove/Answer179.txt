"(Source: The 4 Big Myths of Profile Pictures)For men  you can shoot up at your subject. They will look bigger  and if you are aiming to make them look more imposing  then go for it.5. Adjust your perspectiveTry a few shots and experiment. First shoot straight on  then with the person parallel to the camera  then turn slightly to the left and then slightly to the right  and see what looks best. Move around. Try shooting from chairs  or from the ground. I also like getting eye level with the subject  it creates more intimacy.
