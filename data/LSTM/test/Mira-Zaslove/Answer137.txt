He was small  but looked reasonably healthy  and well cared for-- he was well fed by tourists at the security check in. He even had a hat and some clothes on. A woman in our line  took it a step further. She took a liking to the puppy  and actually put him in her purse and began walking to her flight! The security folks reluctantly let her.I'm not sure if she was able to take the puppy on the small plane to San Juan  but I really wouldn't have been surprised.
