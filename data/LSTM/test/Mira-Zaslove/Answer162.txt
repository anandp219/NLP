Similarly  when I really wanted to get a promotion at work -- but hadn't yet articulated the desire to myself or others-- I had a few dreams where I kept seeing my boss. Nobody wants to dream about their boss (especially me)... but during that time my boss kept coming into my dreams. I was thinking a lot about how much I deserved a promotion. Yet  I was nervous to ask for it  and hadn't really admitted to myself how much I really wanted it. Subconsciously  at night  however my mind was still getting comfortable with the idea and gaining the courage to act.
