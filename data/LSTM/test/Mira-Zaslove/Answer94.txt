  For an Indian  coming to the US  I think one of the biggest culture shocks is the difference in romantic relationships  and marriages in the US vs in India. Obviously  the world is a large place and experiences will differ  but generally attitudes towards dating  sex  and marriage are dramatically different in India vs Europe/North America.For example  my Indian colleague once casually asked me if my marriage was  "a love marriage or an arranged marriage?" This made me laugh. For an American  arranged marriage is very rare.
