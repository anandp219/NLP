  Dylan Thomas published this powerful poem in 1951  and wrote these words as his father was going blind. The dying of the light is a reference to darkness -- actually losing sight -- and ultimately failing health  and the painful inevitability of death. Yet  this poem is not gentle or dark. It is a strong invocation for us to live boldly and to fight. It implores us to not just "go gentle into that good night " but to rage against it. Even at the end of life  when "grave men" are near death  the poem instructs us to burn with life.The poem's meaning is life affirming.
