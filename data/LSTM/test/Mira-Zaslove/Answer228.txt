  The biggest impediment to innovation and technological creation in India is largely political and cultural. India still struggles with corruption  bureaucracy  inequality  poverty  and lack of infrastructure. But considering that India just gained independence within the last 67 years  things have already come a long way. India's economy is growing. If India is able to continue to improve her political  economic  and cultural environment  I believe she will be able to leverage her knowledge and people to really take off.From an American's perspective:I work in an engineering group at a Fortune 50 Silicon Valley tech firm.
