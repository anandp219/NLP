  No  being pregnant doesn't mean that you will automatically be fat. However  for the first few weeks after delivery you might continue to look crazy bloated -- I certainly did.I have heard urban legends of people leaving the hospital in their pre-pregnancy skinny jeans. I'm not sure I believe them. Generally  though  I've been pretty surprised by how quickly the body bounces back. Most pregnant women gain between 25-40 pounds. And right after birth  lose about a third of it:7 -8 lbs - baby1-2 lbs - placenta3-4 lbs - blood and amniotic fluidHowever  due to retained water  the weight loss may not be obvious for over a week.
