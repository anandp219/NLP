Are the hours different on specific teams  during specific projects and times  or when someone is new? You want to find out if you will be expected to pay your dues  of if the whole company is constantly working  all the time. Similarly some industries have crunch times where things are extra busy  but then also have periods of downtime  when everyone goes on vacation. Asking if you will work with different geographies will also give you a sense if you will be expected to work European and Asia hours.
