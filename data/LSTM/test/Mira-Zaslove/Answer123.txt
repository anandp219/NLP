  First impressions are important  so take some time to hone your introduction  and then tweak it depending upon the audience. This question is often asked in interviews  so prepare for it. Nailing the introduction will break the ice and improve your chances of moving to the next steps. I've interviewed hundreds of people over the years  and often I can tell in the first few minutes if I'm interested in hiring a person. Your main goals in the introduction are fairly simple. You need to show that you:Have the ability and desire to do the jobWill fit into the company culture  and be good to work withWon't quit shortly after being hired First off  you want to keep your introduction positive and simple.
