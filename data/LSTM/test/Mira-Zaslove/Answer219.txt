Interview at almost any IT department of almost any major tech firm in Silicon Valley  and you will likely interview with at least one Indian.People tend to hire candidates with backgrounds similar to their own  and with backgrounds similar to those succeeding at the company. Most hiring decisions are made quickly and the Availability heuristic plays a factor. So in that respect  being Indian may help rather than hurt you. Most Americans are not discriminatory. I've been involved with lots of hiring decisions and heard many behind the scenes conversations.
