According to Jung  dreams can present "a spontaneous self portrayal  in symbolic form  of the actual situation in the unconscious." (www.dreamresearch.ca)For example  when I was going through a career shift  I thought a lot about work  and other people who I thought were more successful than me. I was subconsciously envious of some of my friends  who I thought had it all figured out. And during that time  one of my friends  a successful entrepreneur  often showed up in my dreams. However  now that I have a new job and am not obsessing so much about finding "the perfect career" (especially before I go to bed)  this person has completely vanished from dreams.
