  I've been embarrassingly impatient. I've yelled at customer service reps at Ikea for being too slow  etc. At the time  I was working my butt off and couldn't enjoy the time I wasn't working because I was so impatient and rude everywhere I went. I honked at cars  and cursed slow drivers on the road. I was miserable  and so were the people around me. They could just feel my impatience. It was that bad. Recently  however  I went to the dentist and while I was checking in  the receptionist asked me how I was doing.
