Very high. Project high standards for yourself and the way you deserve to be treated. So  if you want to make $100k  don't settle for less than $100k. When recruiters ask you how much you want to make start by saying $130-$150k  and negotiate from there. Don't even consider or apply for a job that doesn't offer $100k. They say the job will only pay $80k  then walk. Don't accept less than you want. Similarly  if you are looking to purchase a car or a house  start by aiming low. Throw out an initial offer less than the one you want to pay.
