My team closed the deals. I stayed behind  answered calls from angry customers  tried to collect on past due payment  and kept up with everything that needed to get done. A major challenge I had to overcome as an new sales manager was to let go of the things I enjoyed doing and was good at. Things that got me promoted  like good rapport with clients  didn't really matter as much anymore. As a first time sales manager  I wasn't prepared for the amount of grunt work. I grudgingly learned that my job was to do the work that nobody else wanted to do.
