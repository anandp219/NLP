  As I understand it  the connection you're making is this: a boy being sexually abused and then turning out to be gay indicates that sexual orientation can be changed. Therefore  since it can be changed  we shouldn't oppose "gay conversion therapies. "This is misguided on a number of levels.A data point of 1. Many boys being abused wind up being straight too. So finding out an abused boy is gay indicates nothing about how changeable sexual orientation is.Gay conversion therapy is opposed because it's harmful  not because it's ineffective.
