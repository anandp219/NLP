(A comparison point: in 1985  the 65th most common name was Catherine  with Cynthia at #66. )Spelling: Precious is very easy to spell. So is Apple.Newness: Hudson doesn't get nearly so much hate. And yet  it's quite a new name and very "trendy. "Know what name is unique and hard to spell? Gayle. There were just 7 Gayle's born in 2014 in the US (and 13 Gail's). You think that's a ridiculous name too  right? Oh. You don't. (You probably just think it's old sounding. )So  what is the real objection here?
