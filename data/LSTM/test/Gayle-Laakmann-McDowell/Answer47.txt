If you're approaching questions the right way  then this doesn't really come up as an issue.First  you should be discussing the problem with your interviewer before you start coding. You shouldn't just code as soon as you think you have a solution to the problem. This would be the point to mention that there's a built-in library that handles the problem.Second  when you code  you should approach it top-down  not bottom-up. Start with the most high level function and then fill in the details as you go.
