  Some celebrities are more "mockable" than others  and their costumes reflect this. This doesn't mean that the celebrity deserves the mocking; it just means that they have something that others like to mock.A costume of George W. Bush is generally there to mock him. People aren't dressing as him out of respect and admiration. They're trying to be funny. The costume-wearer will likely be trotting out some of his dumbest quotes.By contrast  a costume of Michael Phelps is not necessarily a "funny" costume.
