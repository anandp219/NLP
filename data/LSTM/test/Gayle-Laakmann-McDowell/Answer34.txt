You could  however  say it's O(N)  where N is the number of characters in all the words  combined.You absolutely cannot say that it's O(N^2)  because what would N mean? (Okay  there are some bizarre things you could define N to be. For example  if you defined N to be the square root of the number of characters in all the words. That'd be a very strange definition of N.)Example 2: O(N^4)This code builds a string of pairs of elements.123456array = array of charactersstr = ""for x in array: for y in array: pair_to_string = "(" + x + "  " + y + ")" str += pair_to_stringLots of people will want to say this is O(N^2)  where N is the length of the array.
