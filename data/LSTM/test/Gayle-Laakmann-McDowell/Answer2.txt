That's so much better than an interview.We'd just taken the class  so we knew what people struggled with. We could communicate it at their level because we were still at their level. We wouldn't try to explain things with concepts beyond their understanding.When a true subject-matter expert teaches something  he/she often communicates in a way that is too complex.You want your teachers to be great teachers  first and foremost. Experts absolutely have their role. You need an expert to set up the curriculum and to tackle some of the more difficult questions.
