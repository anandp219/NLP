This has motivated a lot of the changes.What's new?This is a huge expansion. You know that thing that many professors do  where they create a new "edition" that's not substantially different but forces you to buy a new version? I don't believe in doing that. This is actually a huge change (as was the 4th->5th edition).Some of the biggest changes:It's about 70% longer. The 5th edition was 500 pages. The 6th is (well  was) about 850. I actually hit the printing limit (800 pages)  so I had to change the page size.
