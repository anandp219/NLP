  Let's look at this from several aspects: correctness  readability  and style.CorrectnessIt's not actually technically correct. It's close and would only require minor tweaks to fix.First  you've implemented this extra little bit that isn't in the problem. If there's only one character of a particular type  you just insert that character (instead of the character + the frequency). That's actually not the assignment.Second  the problem requires that if the compressed string would be longer than the original string  you should return the original string.
