Many people (erroneously) don't feel like men "need" much leave  so men might feel expected to come back to work earlier.Netflix's intention was likely quite good  especially as this is inline with how they offer vacation and sick leave. However  the actual impact might be quite bad.It'd be far more powerful if they had explained the policy as one-year of leave  for men and women. That's technically the same thing  but sends a very different message.
