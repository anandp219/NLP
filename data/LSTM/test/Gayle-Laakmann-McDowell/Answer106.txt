It's not just that search engines can more easily find me and I can get the usernames I want  although that's definitely handy. It's also that "Gayle" is sufficiently descriptive to point to me. If you're in tech and you hear someone talking about someone named Gayle  it's very likely me (or likely enough that you might ask  if you knew me). This would not be true if my name were  say  Sarah.For this reason  I prefer to a more unique name (although with easier spellings) for my children. Unfortunately  it comes with the downside of less anonymity  if that's the path one choose.
