Battery hens live in these for an average of 18 months  almost 329 times as long as the 40 hours Cecil the lion took to dieUnsportsmanship-like behaviorThis is a somewhat more interesting objection.This objection to hunting goes along the lines of it being "unfair" for people armed with modern weaponry and other technology (and usually with support staff) to go up against animals only equipped with teeth and claws.And thus it is not a sport.One might question what fair play might involve.Should the hunter arm himself with a rifle without scopes and/or night vision devices?Should the hunter not camouflage himself?Should the hunter arm himself with a spear - no firearms?Should the hunter only use his bare hands?Yet  hunted animals are physically stronger  probably faster and definitely better equipped with natural weapons than humans.Just what should hunters do to give animals a sporting chance?Similarly  is it sporting for athletes from developed countries - benefiting from nutrition and sport science- who can afford to train full-time- train at high altitudes to increase their red blood cell count- using the latest aerodynamic bodysuits (Under Armours secret Olympic mission: Build a faster speedskating suit) and- who have expensive personal trainers and coachesto go up against athletes from developing countries who- have day jobs- train barefoot on dirt tracks- are malnourished and- compete in simple jerseys?Really  all this fuss about hunters being unsporting is moot since we don't get upset when people are unsporting in other areas.Did Lance Armstrong get death threats for being unsporting and doping?Indeed  it seems to me that the only ones getting death threats in those instances were the ones who contributed to Armstrong's fall from grace (Is Lance Armstrongs Fate Really Worth Making Death Threats?).
