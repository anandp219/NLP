It seems prostitution was a part of life:During the golden eras of Chinese literary history (Tang and Song dynasties)  almost every great poet or politician mentioned his visits to prostitutes without any shame. It is not an exaggeration to claim that prostitutes played a role in stimulating some of the best poems in Chinese history. (Source 2)Of the 49 000 poems in  (The Complete Poetry of the Tang)  "over 4 000 are related to prostitutes and 136 were written by prostitutes themselves" (The World of Chinese).Marco Polo claimed that Peking had more than 20 000 prostitutes  and that there were so many in Hangzhou he could not give an estimate.State prostitution continued until the Qing dynasty  when the Shunzhi and Kangxi Emperors wound down the local and Imperial governments' involvement in prostitution.
