  Other answers have touched on some of the reasons:- The cost of an army- There being no army to begin with- The army doing other things (e.g. guarding the frontier  protecting the realm from invasion  being tied up in wars etc)- Adventurers being trained specialists who move faster and more stealthily- Efficiency: you don't get half your army killed since they are cannon fodder (or arrow/trap fodder  as the case might be)- This being story/game logicHowever  I would suggest a more profound reason: incentivized competition.In the real world  take the example of the Ansari XPRIZE for Suborbital Spaceflight  the first competition organised by the X Prize Foundation.This awarded US$10 million to teams which successfully built private spaceships which could carry three people and fly twice in two weeks.Sure  the X Prize Foundation gave out US$10 million.
