  Frequency data on this is hard to come by  but there have been studies on this.Yes  there're studies on everything.Scissoring aka tribadism aka dyking (slang) is reported to be a common lesbian sexual practice in Blumstein and Schwartz's 1983 classic: American Couples: Money  Work  Sex  though I am unable to find the original and see if any frequency data was reported.Jay and Young's The Gay Report (1979) reports that "tribadism... was also practiced frequently by a large majority of lesbian respondents [but] was the least popular of the three primary methods for having an orgasm in lesbian sexual experience".Munson's 1987 non-representative survey of "more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado" found that 80% had scissored in their last 10 sexual sessions.Martha Rosenthal in "Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society" (2012) reports that the most common lesbian sexual practice is manual stimulation  followed by oral sex and tribadism  but there're no sources provided so take this with a pinch of salt.So basically it seems that lesbians do scissor on a regular basis  but not as often as they touch each other's genitals and have oral sex.
