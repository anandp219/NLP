That's my super power... and thanks to God  that makes me great! And wow! Happy too!Incident 2: I am blessed to be financially decent. Im not rich. But relative to a beggar I have more. Here my greatness lies in money in my purse.While walking I saw a beggar  stopped  bought him a meal and water  washed his hands  opened the food packet and served him.Toothless smile on a dirt face. Believe me... it was PRICELESS! I felt happy!Bottom line: I'd choose happiness any day! I'd rather be happy till I die than be great!
