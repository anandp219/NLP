This works like magic.3. Be with your family and friends. Tell your friends not to mention her in front of you  not because you hate her but because you're trying to move on. (I did that for a friend. Even when she was talking about the guy. I diverted. She loved it as she knew she needed it.)4. Exercise! Even if you don't feel like. Get that hot body out. Heard of "happy hormones"?5. Watch movies but not romantic ones. Do whatever you like but nothing which remindes you of her.6. Don't go into vices like drinking  one night stands.
