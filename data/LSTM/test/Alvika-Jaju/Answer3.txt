  In order of priority:1. Honesty! THE MOST IMPORTANT. No bending of truth with me. I cannot tolerate dishonesty.2. Respect for my family and me! MOST IMPORTANT3. Strength of Character: how much can I trust him especially w.r.t. to opposite sex. DEAL MAKER or BRAKER. If I lose trust in somebody  I cannot help but walk away. So never hurt me or anyone in such a way.4. His family: I'm an Indian. In future I will be living with his family.5. Humour! Forgiving and understanding: essential. I make mistakes  I know that.
