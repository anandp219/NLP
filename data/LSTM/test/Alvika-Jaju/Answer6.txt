"It's better being depressed for while than be treated less than what you deserve.You may tell her you wI'll move on. Cut the one month. 1. Cut all ties. No stalking. No talking. She wanted to move on. She can manage. You need to manage yourself. If she cries  tell her she needs to be on either side of the bank not in the river. If she can't decide  well then she needs to suffer alone and not make you suffer with her.2. Move on by focusing on yourself. Be busy like never before. Make a time table and be disciplined!
