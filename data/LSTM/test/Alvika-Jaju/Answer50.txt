He WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU. He will give you what is best for you. Ask him what you want he will hear you.10. Words from my little brother:  Why take tension didi? Don't be sad. We should always be happy. When he wants me to hug him  love him he comes and asks for it. So simple! Don't we just forget 'asking' as we grow up?He enjoys what he does! (Except studying of course :P)He once asked me  "Why do you get angry?!" I didn't have an answer... have been controlling my anger ever since.He is happy with little things in life!
