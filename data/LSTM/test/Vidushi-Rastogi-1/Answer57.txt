  Interesting question.While I would have passed the question as mockery if asked live  I am in the mood of maths now and hence the answer.In 2014  India recorded 12 360 farm suicides = AAccording to Census 2011 there are 118.9 million cultivators across the country = B*Cultivators is an umbrella term. The popular term 'farmer' is a subset of cultivator.1 million = 10 raised to the power of 6.Doing simple arithmetics (B-A) you can understand that it is not statistically significant number if considered for productive manforce.
