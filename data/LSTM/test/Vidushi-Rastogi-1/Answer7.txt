Both are invasive methods  pain and hence non-compliance is usually observed in patients. The present treatment is also an economic burden to patients. Given the availability of advanced biomarkers and genetic markers as an accurate proxy for disease detection  it becomes relevant to develop intervention therapy.Autoimmune therapy targets auto-antigens without compromising the organisms capabilities to mount an immune response against foreign antigen. Oral administration of protein antigens can result in diminished peripheral immune responses to a subsequent systemic challenge with the same antigen  in a process known as oral immune tolerance.With greater patient acceptance of oral rather than systemic therapies (e.g.  by injection) and antigen-specific effects without toxic effects of general immunosuppression  oral tolerance remains an attractive strategy.Insulin is obvious auto-antigen implicated in T1 Diabetes.
