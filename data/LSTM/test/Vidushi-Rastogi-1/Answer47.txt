Full time job has advantages of employer-sponsored benefits like pensions  insurance and appraisals. These are not equally accessible to freelancers as of now. It is also not very clear as how these employees should be taxed. It needs global discussion   change in policies and regulation of terms and conditions to make freelancing come under the same radar as full time employment. The benefits should be proportionate to work and not the type of employment.
