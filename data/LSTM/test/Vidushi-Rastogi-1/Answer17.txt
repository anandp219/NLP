  I can't stop myself doing some maths regarding up-votes.Lets make an index  Popularity of content normalised with number of followers   Actual popularity= Number of followers / Number of up-votes.In the question Actual popularity of the writers is same.TW 10k followers/2k up-votes= 5   Another guy 100 followers/20 up-votes = 5The appreciation is proportionate. Now coming to content   the another guy  has added more information to the content but his audience is limited and the content doesn't reach to its desired appreciation.
