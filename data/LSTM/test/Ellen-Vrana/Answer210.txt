No  I have one person  my husband. He's the only person I show. He's the only person in my life who I can SHOW my monster to. Not even my cats! Ha. That makes it worst  I realize now  not showing people - hiding it  makes it worse.The first step is telling someone  people  you trust  about this. Letting them in. Tell them what you feel. What happens. What you go through. I think the second step  is helping other people with THEIR monsters. I can't tell you how many times I've let people cry to me.
