  What you're saying is that you expect others to care and love you the way you care and love them. There is nothing wrong with that  we all do that. We show love in different ways and then when we receive it  if it's not in the way we give it  we fail to recognize it. And even think it's not there. I prefer to be completely alone when I'm going through something hard. Not bothered  not forced to talk about it - just left to sort it out on my own. So  naturally  I give other people space when they are going through something hard.
