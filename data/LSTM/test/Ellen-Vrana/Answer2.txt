I doubt either my husband or I will get there  we're not that mature.True love isn't a binary thing. It's not a line you cross. It's a journey  a long  long journey. And the longer you're on it  the less relevant the destination becomes. Almost like life itself.I don't give a shit if I have True Love in my marriage. Rather  I ask myself (in those rare moments when I'm being mature and reflective): Can I love my husband more purely and selflessly than I do now? The answer to that is always; YES. Yes  yes  yes.Does that mean I haven't found True Love?
