Not really.Not in the way people talk about it today. I've done wrong  messed up  made mistakes. Some big  some bigger  some Texas-sized.But I've nothing in common with the ubiquitous failure porn writers who treat failure as a series of colossal external events - over which they have no control - which for some reason happened to them and now they carry the failure around like badge of honor or a mark of Cain and that makes them great - just having failed.I don't wear failure badges. I just have me  the product of my failures.My failures aren't external or things that happen to me.
