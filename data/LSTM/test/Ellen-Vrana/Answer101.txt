  Yes  it is a terrific idea to read fiction while you write fiction. I'm doing it now. Writing without proximate fiction is like writing with half my mind. Inconceivable.I'm working on a short-story about friendship. Next to me I have a cat (incidental but I thought I'd mention him because he's my friend thus muse) a couple books with stories that involve friendship in childhood  two books that involve coming-of-age stories  and one book that is about friendship and loss in adulthood.These books are not stacked in the manner of a cat-fort.
