. . " that is tough. Commendable. That's what I go for.Facing what I could have done isn't easy  I process failure pretty thoroughly. I look at process  effort  desire  details  strategy - every aspect. I process at it so thoroughly  it's digestive.It's almost like I eat my failures. Sounds weird. But that's the process. I cut them up  slather on the sauce (usually beer  real beer  not metaphorical beer)  and chew and digest and once I've extracted all the protein  calcium  magnesium and other fine goodness that my body needs  you know  you s*^t the rest and move on.I ate a burger two nights ago  couldn't tell you where it is now.
