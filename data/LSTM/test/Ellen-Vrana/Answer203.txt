  Quora definitely allows satire. But I don't think satire is what people think it is.Satire isn't sarcasm. It isn't just humor. It isn't flippant remarks or half-assed answers intended to ridicule the OP. Those answers provide zero value  are offensive  lazy and thus  should be flagged.Satire is an intelligent  highly-resourced and well-honed literary genre that brings out well-documented fallacies about a particular institution  group of people or policies so that the readers will be awakened to obvious truths of injustice (and thus want to change those institutions  people etc.).
