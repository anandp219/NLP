  Writing like you talk is a good idea  writing as you talk (i.e. without editing) is not.Good  modern writing (for non-specialized purposes) should be AUTHENTIC and CLEAR.To be authentic  good practice is to write without jargon  esoteric vocab  rhetoric or pomposity. How familiar a tone you use will depend on your audience  but personally I prefer to read something that has a more formal than an overly-familiar tone. Familiarity is often cheesy. Checking your work by asking "could I actually hear myself saying that?"
