The immediacy of Holden's feelings  his reactions  his vernacular  his limitations is the theme of the book. Kerouac's On the Road (1951) in 1st person for similar reasons and works extremely well. Neither would have been as poignant in 3rd person.- Of course  if your character is a psychotic  deranged killer  you almost have to use first person  see Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho. Good example of a unreliable narrator.- Frankenstein  by Mary Shelley uses 3 different 1st person POV  nestled like Russian dolls  It allows the reader to sympathize with each character.
