Truman Capote wrote In Cold Blood because the story was interesting to him  he made it interesting to us.Yeah  (you say) but Ellen  that's a story about murder. It's bound to be interesting. You'd be right. Except....2. If you write well  you can make anything interesting. One of my favorite authors is Robin Lane Fox. He is the Head Gardener for University of Oxford and writes a weekly column in the Financial Times and wrote Thoughtful Gardening. I garden  so naturally  it was literary butter for me.
