"I live with this fear every day. I have anxiety about it every hour of every single day. I'm afraid that someone will see  think I'm not normal  treat me with gloves  be afraid of me  think less of me  reject me  hate me. Call me mental. Crazy. Not normal.I feel most of the time like I have this awful monster inside of me. (The term is derogatory  I've played with making it less so - like "Polar Bear." I'm just not there yet.) A monster of sadness  anger  hatred  fear  panic  mental illness  all bad things.
