So we'll focus on Option B.1. Don't restrict your answer to the question asked. The question asks about soldiers  bridges - meh. What else is this about? Physics being more powerful than man? Engineering affecting us in ways we can't explain or notice? Military solutions that affect the ways we live our lives? Or perhaps a paradox: When soldiers misstep over bridges they are actually preventing the bridge from collapsing.Reframe it to address a bigger issue.. For example  you'll notice my answer doesn't restrict itself to your question  if I had I'd have just edited your answer directly.
