  Don't live your life in fear of sunk costs.Don't be afraid of wasted time or stepping off a ladder you don't want to be climbing.Many people hurry to figure out who they are  and who they aren't. This reaches a frenzy around your age. People talk definitively. People at the end of their 20s talk the most definitively and thus it feels everyone has it figured out and you have to too. You stop wherever you are and announce to the world;THIS IS WHO I AM AND THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO DO!!!Done. And that is that.
