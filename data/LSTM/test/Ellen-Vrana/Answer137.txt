  I need to answer this in two parts. 1. What is an Essay (and how do you define it)?2. How can you write a better one?I don't mean to patronize but if you want to write essays  you must know what they are  and what they aren't. I'm not sure many people know or agree on the definition  I'm not sure I know  but I'll essais to describe it.And that stupid pun is the essence what we're talking about. The Essais (conjugation of the French verb essayer  to try)  was popularized by French writer/statesman/man of letters Michel de Montaigne as a writing that attempts to prove  describe  debate  and discuss something critical and fundamental and perhaps not conclusively decided.
