Referring all Latin descendants as "Mexicans" is ignorant. Like referring to all Asian immigrants as Chinese.Second  without more context  what you say could be derogatory. It's not derogatory to call someone Mexican  just like it isn't to call someone Jewish.But to describe looks? What do you mean by that? How does someone listening know that you mean nothing by it? Especially if they are a Latino who HAS heard derogatory statements made about them based on their skin color  height  hair - all sorts of things.
