  It felt like a natural extension of our relationship and nothing out of the ordinary. In fact  I can't exactly remember which one of us said it first or how it happened.We don't really have a *story. * But I'll attempt to tell our non-story here:We were living together in Palo Alto  about to graduate from Stanford Business School and feeling anxious about the fact that we had jobs in different cities. I took a job in Chicago and he in New York.So we discussed what to do: Should we stay together?
