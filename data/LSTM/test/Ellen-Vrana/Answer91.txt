Instead  the narration knows the thoughts and feelings of MOST OR ALL the characters.Example: John felt sad. Susie looked at him  confused if he was sad or mad. Jane felt cold when she saw John's face. Here  we know what everything is thinking  and it's a bit much.Considerations for using this narrative perspective- Can cause whiplash if too many heads are explored at once; create a break between what character x thinks and character y. - Is there a protagonist - at least one someone the reader can identify or care about?- Needs consistency  Character x's thoughts can't be open to us in one part and opaque in another.
