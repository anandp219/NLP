Really? How did that work? And show interest  surprise. Lean forward. Make eye contact. Show them that you are listening and care. (Just don't flirt - not appropriate.)4. Offer your opinion and an anecdote.Don't be afraid of saying "me too" or "that happened to me!". When I say "opinion" I don't mean religion or politics. I mean affirming what they said and relating to it. This forms a bond. Obviously  only if it's true.Nothing wrong with it but you might want to say "I'm so sorry for interrupting."
