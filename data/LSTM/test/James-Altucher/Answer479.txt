K. Anders Ericsson and Malcom Gladwell have popularized the idea that it takes 10 000 hours of practice with INTENT to be the best in the world at something. Intent means  measure your success  give yourself feedback  and try to better your results at every attempt. If you just play cards for 10 000 hours  you won't get better. but if you study with a teacher  read books  figure out how to measure your success  and analyze your failures  that's "practice with intent". 10 000 hours is roughly 10-20 years of hard work.
