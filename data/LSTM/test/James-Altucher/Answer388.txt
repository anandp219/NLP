Finally  someone said yes. But then I realized I was too late. So I was an example of being a failure. I missed a detail. I failed rule #2. Thats ok. That happens to me. Whatever. Bobby Fischer always took it to the next level. Nobody ever thought he was the greatest talent in chess history. He probably had average talent. But he always said  "how can I take chess to the next level". When he was a kid he learned Russian so he could read the Russian chess magazines. After that  he never lost a US Championship.
