You can order $2 bills at your bank. 2. Wear a lab coat in airports. People will let you go past them in line. 3. Carry waiter's pads with you. Use them to take notes in meetings. Use them to write down your ten ideas a day. Use them as business cards. People will think you are frugal and clever. And it's always a good conversation-starter. People will say  "I'll take fries with that burger" and I'll leave it up to you to come up with a witty response. 4. Mirror people. I was talking to Nick Morgan  author of "Power Cues".
