We started our first product for $2000. We sold eight months later for $10 000 000. We outsourced almost the entire business (by the way  the one bad thing about this is that Google wouldn't buy us because of this).It's not as good as it sounds. I'm an idiot and lost a good chunk of the money later. But at least I didn't hire anyone. G) CLEAR ROLESA lot of partnerships fail because there are no clear roles defined. Like  the two partners are "co-CEOs" so nobody knows who to talk to. This is BS. There have to be clear rules.
