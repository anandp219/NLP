It used to be a hotel. Things break. Pipes crumble in the hands of the plumber.I email the landlord  who calls a plumber  who gets new pipes that are paid for by the landlord. The landlord wasnt expecting it but thats what they signed up for.Meanwhile  I read a book on the couch in the other room.The same thing when Hurricane Sandy came over the river. People were canoeing in the street outside my house. The water filled two feet in my house.This is the first time in 100 years the water got this high  the landlord told me.
