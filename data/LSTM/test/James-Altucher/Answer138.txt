My boss came into my cubicle (very embarrassing since everyone in the cubicles around could hear and would later gossip) and said  "We really want you to work out but it's not so we are going to send you to remedial school on computers." I drove two hours every day to go to a remedial class in computer programming. I learned how to program then and eventually started three software companies. The above is not saying "colleges are bad". There are many aspects. The above just says: here is what I learned  here is what good it did me.
