  I'm really glad you asked. I am the luckiest guy ever. I'm so lucky I'm not even afraid to jinx myself by saying it out. Like standing up in a movie theater and saying to everyone  "I am the luckiest guy ever". Often when people do something like that  they stop being lucky. They take it for granted after that. That won't happen to me. I'm lucky at the cellular level. My cells don't even really know English so they aren't listening to me. But when people say "luck" they mean many things. Like  have I won the lottery?
