Telling me  "ease up  soldier  things are not so simple. What you did yesterday was pretty atrocious." Ok. But we'll all be equal when our ashes spread like dust in a breeze. The breeze kisses all the ashes no matter what we did. And until then  I get to go to sleep early and let everyone else rule the world. All of you who passed the finals and were blessed with blue eyes.
