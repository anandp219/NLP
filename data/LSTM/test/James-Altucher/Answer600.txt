But if you already can hand-deliver the customers  what do you need the traditional publisher for?Wasnt that supposed to be what the publishers would get for you? Dont they get you in bookstores? The answer is no.Bookstores take very few of the books published by publishers. And whenever you see a book facing forward  or on the front table  or a staff pick that means the publisher usually paid to have that special placement. Most books dont get this. And if you dont get that  chances are your books wont sell.2) How do you build your platform?Have an honest voice.
