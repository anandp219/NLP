  Getting a degree wasted five years of my life. I got an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. Then I went to graduate school for Computer Science but I left after two years. I put in my 10 000 hours of programming. I knew how to build an operating system. I could take apart and put together a computer. If I lived in the 1800s I probably could invent computers. I thought I was good. When I got my first job in "the real world" I was a programmer. My second day on the job I crashed the entire network and lost everyone's email.
