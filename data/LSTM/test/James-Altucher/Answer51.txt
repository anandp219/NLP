But the sun is still there  shining equally on everyone. In an interview we're all equally lit in the sun  no matter what thoughts go through our head or what experiences we've had.The listeners are the sun. I can either show them light  or darkness. And they can't see if it's just darkness.G) ALWAYS BRING IT BACK DOWN TO THE LISTENERYou know who your audience is. The person you're interviewing either doesn't know or doesn't care. I don't say this in a critical way. Their business is their business and your business is your audience.Make sure when things go on a tangent  that some value is extracted for the audience.
