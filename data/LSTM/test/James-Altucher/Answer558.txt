Maybe your last book was bad. Thats ok. That happens to everyones first book. Now read a lot of good books so you can solve the hard problem of what makes a good book. Then write.Failure is not a hard problem. Its a label. Failure is in the past. Hard problems can be solved right now.- DONT CARE:When I thought I had failed  what I really was worried about was: would other people think I was a failure?Yes. Yes they did.When I stopped caring about that  when I took the word out of my vocabulary  I suddenly stopped caring what people thought.Then what happened?
