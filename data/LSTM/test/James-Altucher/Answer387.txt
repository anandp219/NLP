Your mentor  your boss  your teacher  your whatever - the one who has given you a chance - take some of those details and take it to the next level. The other day I was invited to a special screening of the movie Pawn Sacrifice starring Tobey Maguire as insane world chess champion Bobby Fischer. I was going to go. I had an extra ticket. I asked a lot of people to go with me.
