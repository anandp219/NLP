I rewrote about 20% of the book after reading things that didnt quite sound right out loud.So  it was another round of edits (with the help of Nils) to improve the book  a process I never wouldve gone through if I hadnt done the audio version.8) Title.This deserves its own category. I had total control over the title. My first choice for the book was The Choose Yourself Era. But whenever anyone asked me to say the title I had trouble saying it. Era sounds like Error. One person asked me if it was going to a book about archaealogy.
