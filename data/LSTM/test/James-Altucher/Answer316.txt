  Heres a rule of the universe: when you envy someone  you put a wall up between yourself and the things about that person you envy. If they have a good job  theres now a new wall between you and getting a good job. Why? Because you are programming yourself to dislike people who havegood jobs. So how will you get one? Unless you like disliking yourself.Clearly envy is bad. What you have to do is train your envious mind. Everytime you notice yourself thinking an envious thought about say  Alice try to catch yourself doing that and then reverse it.Think: God bless Alice.
