I was going to use $2 million of my money to buy a Super Bowl commercial. In the commercial I was planning on just walking around and doing nothing. I would take up 60 seconds of empty Super Bowl space for no reason at all. But I was a little nervous. What if I did that and suddenly everyone would protest and say  "James should have given that money to charity! "I would actually wake up at night sweating about that. That is not very lucky. Wishing and Luck are the opposites. Once I wished for $100 000 000.00 I instantly went broke.
