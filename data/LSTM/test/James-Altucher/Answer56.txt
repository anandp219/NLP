  FINANCIAL FRIDAYS: THE WTF! ON THIS STOCK MARKET 'CRASH'Shit  I'm about to break all the rules of selling and marketing but I don't care. People need to stop being fooled. It has to end.I write every day. I publish something here and on my email list maybe 5-6 times a week.These emails are very important to me and they are about 500-2000 words. Short  to the point  life lesson  anecdote  and what I love to do more than anything in the world.The emails go for free to about 200 000 people a day.But there are some messages people need to know to further enhance the work they are doing  whether its financial or starting a business  or part of my daily practice of physical mental emotional and spiritual health.I put my heart into that also.So I write up to 10 000 words once a month for that.
