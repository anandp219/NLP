Don't waste your most productive energies solving a problem that now only has incremental improvements. Re-focus the best energies on solving harder and harder problems. Always keeping the value of "how can I help a billion people" will keep Google from becoming a Borders bookstore (which went out of business after outsourcing all of their sales to Amazon). How does this apply to the personal? Instead of being a cog in the machine for some corporation  come up with ways to automate greater abundance.
