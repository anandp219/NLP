When someone consistently has a lot of excuses for why something has gotten done  I know they are not ready for the next step. The next step is an invitation to glory. They are not invited.yet. When I was young  I was the man with the excuses. I had them every day. I was a master of them. But I fooled nobody but myself. And went from job to job  business to business  blaming others  blaming external circumstances  etc. And you know what: I was right! If Im reading my wifes email and shes cheating on me  I deserve to fail.
