I give myself full credit on that one even if she disagrees with me.6) The SEC investigated Buffett in 1974-1976 for manipulating penny stocks. This was a serious charge. And Buffett takes his reputation seriously. And the reality is (I wont get into details but Janet Lowe covers it here)  he WAS manipulating penny stocks and he sort of admits it. But he had a good reason. He was buying a company and he promised a shareholder of the company that the price wouldnt be lower than a certain number. So he made sure the price of the penny stock never fell below that number.
