if it's someone I love  I listen. I help. I surprise.Often we pray to things that don't exist. Often we meditate with invisible goals in mind. Often we believe in science fiction.But right this second you can feel love  and that's the only religion.- Right now.Every time I've had a problem in the future  it never came true.Every time I've had a regret in the past  the regret kept me glued to the mud.Right now you are dealt cards. No other hand before or after will help you right now.So this is the only moment to focus on.
