Ive been doing that all my life.When I moved to NYC I lived out of a garbage bag. Before I got married I lived in a dive hotel. After I got divorced I lived in the same hotel.I like feeling like I could lose everything and survive. Maybe this is why I have lost everything sometimes. But its also how I keep surviving and learning more each time.This will sound corny so please skip to the next part: but property rights are not real.Loving who you are and where you are and what you are doing is the only thing that is real.Live in your heart and not your home and you will never feel lonely or the need to establish roots.Share that love with the people around you.
