Thinking  this seems like a good habit is a start. Reading about it is a second start. ButActions are outside of the head or body. Take 1% action per day.More than that and youll give-up (diets dont work!). Less than that and it might take too long (diets dont work! ).It doesnt happen in one day. There are no goals. Theres only practice. Practice never makes perfect. Practice makes happy. Practice makes habits.I started writing 23 years ago. Every day I read a little. Every day I wrote. I wanted to get better.I was very bad at the beginning.I just looked at some fiction I wrote 23 years ago.
