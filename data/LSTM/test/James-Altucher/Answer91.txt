What does your "good enough" day look like. What's one thing that moves you past that? -----My job as a leader is to make sure everybody in the company has great opportunities  and that they feel they're having a meaningful impact and are contributing to the good of society. Whenever I've managed companies and have had the small opportunity to be a leader I've judged my success on only one thing: Does the employee at night go home and call his or her parents and say  "guess what I did today!" I'm not sure this always worked.
