Give others credit all the time. Then you are the source of credit. Just like a bank. When people want more credit  who do they go to? They go to you! Just like they would go to the bank when they need more money. You look at the history of every company. The founders who never followed through and ended up not being successful (whatever happened to) are the ones who wanted credit too early on. They fought for it. They died for it. They cried for it. They went broke for it. Give credit. Be the bank.
