That's boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don't exist.Sometimes I want to give up on whatever I'm working on. I'm not working on major billion person problems. And sometimes I think I write too much about the same thing. Every day I try to think  "What new thing can I write today" and I actually get depressed when I can't think of something totally new. But I am working on things that I think can help people. And if you are out side of people's comfort zones  if you are breaking the normal rules of society  people will try to pull you down.
