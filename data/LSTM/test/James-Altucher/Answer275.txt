Mary Shelley wondered what it would be like if a machine had intelligence. She called her machine Frankenstein and made up stories about how people would treat such a hybrid human/machine. Ada Lovelace wondered what it would be like to tell a machine what to do. Could such a machine ever exist? Steve Jobs loved calligraphy and using electronics to scam the phone system. Nobody discovered their passion as an adult. The child that still lives and breathes and is hidden inside all of us knows the secret of our passion.
