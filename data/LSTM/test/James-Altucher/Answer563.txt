Eventually it gets a lot worse. We die. That's the only real truth. But in the meantime  here's what I try to do to be successful and work harder. - NOTHINGI don't read the News. I used to work for the news. I know what happens there. The more you read news  the less informed you are  the more time you just wasted. Since I stopped reading news  I read more books. i get more info. I feel more alive. I get less scared. I also don't talk to people who want to gossip. Gossip never made anyone a success.
