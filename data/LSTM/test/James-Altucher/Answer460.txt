Having cash is a nice thing. It reduces stress.But also you can invest in yourself. Or companies that are growing.If companies arent growing  I can tell you that housing prices will go lower. Because housing prices depend on the stability of employment.By definition then  companies will always grow faster than housing  in aggregate.Average income for people age 18-35 has done from $36 000 to $33 000 in the past twenty years. While debt has increased 100x. Not good.WHY DO PEOPLE ALWAYS ARGUE FOR HOUSINGTheres something called investment bias.
