Don't think that less sleep makes you more productive. Whenever I get only six hours of sleep  I know the day is going to be useless. Preparation is how you win the game  and lack of sleep means you didn't prepare well. - GRATITUDEWorry never solves tomorrow's problems  and only takes energy away from today. Worry and Gratitude can't exist in the mind at the same time. Regret and Gratitude can't exist in the mind at the same time. Anger and Gratitude can't exist in the mind at the same time. Whenever I notice these things happening in my head  I try to replace with gratitude.
