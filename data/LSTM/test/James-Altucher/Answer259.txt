Too litttle and it's not enough. It's like you don't care about luck. Physical: Just do 10 pushups a day  five times a day. After you do this for awhile. Maybe (the 1% growth) add a pushup. Or a squat. Or whatever. Sleep eight hours. Lucky people are always well-rested. How else will enjoy your luck. Eat well. Every cell on your body has come from something you ate over the past seven years. So make sure your body is all set for luck by eating well. What is eating well? You know! Don't deny it. Emotional: Be nice to the people around you.
