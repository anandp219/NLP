This post is about HOW.Nothing you ever thought of before amounted to anything  thats why you are exactly where you are at that moment of hitting bottom. Because all of your billions of thoughts have led you to right there. You cant trust the old style of thinking anymore. They came  they saw  they lost.You have to come up with a new way of thinking. A new way of having ideas. A new ways of interacting with the outside universe.Youre in crisis. Time to change. Time to become an IDEA MACHINE.People know what runners high is.
