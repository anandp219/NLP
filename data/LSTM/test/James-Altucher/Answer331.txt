He did not use the words god or jesus or spirit above.This is all anyone needs to transform a life of fear and stress and anxiety and regret into a life of well-being and happiness.Sometimes I think Im not a good person. Sometimes I look at people on the street and hate them for no reason. Sometimes Im not as good as I could be to family or friends.But Im trying to be better. I hope every day I can wake up and remind myself of Franciss exact words above.To care greatly for creation is the essence of choosing yourself instead of letting anyone else do it for you.Instead of being held back by judgments or anger or fear or regret.Maybe one day I will be able to live in a studio  call people who need help  eat lunch with strangers  take selfies with whoever.For now  I write blog posts.
