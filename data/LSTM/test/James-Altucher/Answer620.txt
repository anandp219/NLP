I was competing with too many of the other authors in the publishers stable to get any attention from foreign publishers.Now I own all the rights to my book. Most people who self-publish arent thinking foreign rights. You still have to have someone who is going to be your advocate with the foreign publishers. So I got a foreign rights agency  2 Seas Agency  to handle all of the foreign rights on a commission basis. They go to book conferences all over the world and have connections in each country.In June  the first month the book was out  Marleen Seegers from 2 Seas sold rights to: Brazil (USD 2500)  China (USD 4300)  Korea (USD 5000).
