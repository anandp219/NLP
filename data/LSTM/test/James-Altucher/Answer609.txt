With millions of books out there  the competition is incredible. As my friend  Srinivas Rao puts it  I had to build a small army to create the best possible product. Hiring the best editor  design firm  marketing firm  and audio firms were all part of that. Not just the best around but who I felt were the best in the world.6) Design.I never liked any of the designs on my traditionally published books but I had no control over them. I dont mean this to sound so anti-publisher. But they were busier with bigger authors than me and I dont think they were always willing to devote resources to me.I made sure I put out a product I could be proud of.
