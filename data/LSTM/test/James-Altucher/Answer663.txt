You also have to look in the right places. Whenever I've looked in a bar  disaster resulted. Whenever I've looked in a chess club  I'd only meet men (who became good friends). I meet friends by making sure I go to places where the people have some similar values to me. So I don't go to a hockey game (there might be good friends there but it's not a good SOURCE). Or I might go to a conference where people are focused on improving themselves. Or   to be honest  since I so freely express my own values in my writing I tend to like the people who gravitate to my writing.
