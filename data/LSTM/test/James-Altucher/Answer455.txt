I watched Bladerunner.But I still want the ability to pick up and move at a moments notice if I want to. Freedom makes me happy.PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE THE BASIS OF AMERICAMany people like to own real estate because of the word real. It feels more real than money.Or stocks. Or bonds.I get that. It is real. And in America  nobody can take your land from you if you own it.But not many people own their land. The bank owns it. Hence the $15 trillion in debt.And people will never own it (the 4.5 year average thing).But this is a judgment call again.I like to know I can live out of a single bag.
