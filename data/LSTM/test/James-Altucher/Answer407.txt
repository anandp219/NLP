I looked to the right and there was Federal Hall where George Washington was sworn in. I loved it. Which was an odd feeling  because everything else was going to hell. The S&P 500 was heading towards a 20 year low  where it reached the magically hellacious number of 666. I was losing more money than I thought possible and going through a divorce. One time I looked at my bank account. I considered  once again  jumping out the window  or figuring out what drugs would anesthetize me long enough Id never have to think about my problems again.
