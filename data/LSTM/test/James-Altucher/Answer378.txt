I have failed as a husband  as have many. I hope I don't fail as a parent but certainly some people would look at my track record and say  "yes  yes indeed  he failed as a parent." I'm not the best boyfriend. One time I broke up with a girlfriend while I was on the elevator up to meet her her in her apartment. I just hit the down button and never spoke to her again. And then I was a good boyfriend because I sent a teddy bear to the other girl who was in the elevator with me. We ended up dating three months.
