That's probably too much. Almost like a mini-book. Too big for a Quora answer. For instance  this month  I write about 20 reasons for the crash and I found a super guest writer to basically write the BIBLE of angel investing.And I have about 10 people helping me research  do the tech infrastructure for this  etc. And the whole thing I sell for about $5 and some renewal rate a year from now with money back guarantees.But I'm not writing this to sell. If the guys I work with find out (and they will once I hit publish)  they will probably be upset at me.I'm sorry: Jeff  Mark  Adam  Dillon  Tim  Emily  Mae  Mary  David  Garin  Peter.
