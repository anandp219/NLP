  At midnight my door opened and I saw the shadow of someone about 4 feet tall walk into my room and stand by my side of the bed. I cant sleep  she said and she was smart enough to also say  my mind is racing. Over the nine years of her life so far she has probably heard me say that many times. Racing racing racing. At noon there are many things to think about. At 3 in the morning  there's nothing to think about. So we race. Like when I was losing a home and I threw a chair and the police were called.
