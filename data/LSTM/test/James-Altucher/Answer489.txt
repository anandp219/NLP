But sometimes I spend days in a house by myself and forget to do these things. I know that sounds gross. But it feels good when I focus on hygiene. 20. Treat Everyone Like You Are Their Mother. A friend of mine says that when she is around the Dalai Lama "it feels like he is treating everyone like he is their mother". So this seems like a good habit to have. When I think of someone I randomly meet and I change my mindset to pretend like I am their mother  I become more concerned for their happiness  their comfort  their careers  their ability to find people they love.
