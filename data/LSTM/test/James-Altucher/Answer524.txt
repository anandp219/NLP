So it teaches surrender if you are uncomfortable with it. (Claudia touching her toes)H) I try not to lie to anyone or harm anyone. Because then you have to keep track of which lie was told to who. Or you feel bad about who you harmed  which was usually as a result of either anger or greed. If I never harm anyone I never have to deal with anyones anger (unless its irrational anger). Anger makes me unhappy.I) Sometimes you cant avoid work that you dont want to do. We all have to feed our families.
