"I will NEVER eat carbs!" Or whatever your favorite macro-nutrient is to hate. Always remember that whatever macro-nutrient you avoid  there's an entire society made up of octogenarians who have been eating that food group all of their lives and they are completely healthy. So whatever you do  whatever you eat  whoever you hang out with: if net-net  there's more good than bad  then that's a good start. And  as you do that  you'll find your net-net weighs more and more on the side of what is good for you.
