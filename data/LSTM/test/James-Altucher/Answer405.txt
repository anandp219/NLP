On September 1  1920  Italian anarchists exploded a bomb  killing 38  and injuring 143 (thank you Wikipedia. Thank you World Wide Web. Now I have every number I ever need for the rest of my life. My building  a bomb  38 deaths). About 89 years later  at the worse possible time  someone decided to convert the building into apartments. The building was a ghost town. Nobody wanted to live on Wall Street. It was the black hole of capitalism. My building had bowling alley. A basketball court. A pool.
