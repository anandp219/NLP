  The earliest known religion has been found in the galaxy: z8_GND_5296. Look it up. Massive telescopes in New Mexico have found the evidence but I happen to know a bit more. Here's the truth: Apparently the Universe is very stupid. ("uni" "verse" - one story). For a brief moment on this galaxy there was consciousness. Some single-celled bacteria woke up for pico-second and realized it was alive. Once anything is alive  it wants to know "Why". Since this amoeba-like creature was created in the image of the universe it has all of the other qualities of the universe.
