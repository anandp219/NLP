  How do I stop loving a girl who doesnt love me  someone asked me.I didnt answer him correctly. I gave some BS answer. The correct answer is: theres nothing you can do. Youre in pain. Youre wounded. Time heals all wounds.For me  I fall in love very quickly so my only solution is to fall in love again  whatever that means  usually obsession and addiction and disappointment like someone sitting on your lungs and not letting you breathe until just a single breath is all you ask for.In other words  I make every mistake possible.But I did give some response a la Sting about setting them free and he replied and said  but shouldnt love REQUIRE that the person I love make me happy?What!
