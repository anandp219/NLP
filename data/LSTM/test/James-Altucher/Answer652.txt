What were we drinking? Something something. The bathroom at that point was in a telephone booth. I think I went there. We were out in the street. It was raining. It was three in the morning. She was laughing. I fell in the middle of the street. Lexington and 50th. Cars were coming. My face wet against the ground. I think I fell asleep. She fell also  on top of me. Laughing. Cars honked and swerved around us. We crawled to the corner. I don't think any cars hit us but if they had then maybe I'm dead and this is just another universe I'm answering this in.
