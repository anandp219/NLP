I didn't think about it. I just said that word and stopped thinking about money. Did that make me the money? No. That's stupid. Of course it didn't.

I suppose it's a cliche to say I'm lucky because I'm not one of them. But that's always the case. Every one of us can find someone worse off and someone better off. And it's built into our mammallian evolutionary machinery to keep track of our "status" in the tribe.
