Nobody ever thought he was the greatest talent in chess history. He probably had average talent. But he always said  "how can I take chess to the next level". When he was a kid he learned Russian so he could read the Russian chess magazines. After that  he never lost a US Championship. He was 13 years old. He was so much better than the Americans he even stopped playing in the US championship. And he took it to the next level right up until the world championship. For the first time in his life he played a different first move.His opponent  the older world champion had ONLY prepared for the one move Fischer ever did.
