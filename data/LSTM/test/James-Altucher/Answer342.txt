Everyone says the "market crashed".Guess what. The market is FLAT in the past 12 months. What crash? So it can go up or down from here.But here's what we know at the very least:A) It's not about China!B) It's not about the Federal Reserves Interest Rate!C) And it's nothing like 2009!I wish I had room for all 17 items. But if all you know are these three  avoid the newspapers  take a deep breath and relax.The world is a hard place to live in.People always say  "you're the average of the 5 people you spend time with".But this is true also: "you're the average of the five things you read".If all you do is read newspapers (and the major ones lie the most) then you will mis-informed and in a constant state of anxiety.I know I was until I STOPPED reading them.
