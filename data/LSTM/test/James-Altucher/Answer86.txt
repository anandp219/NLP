  I visited Google a few weeks ago and  after almost getting arrested  my mind was blown. First  Claudia wandered into the garage where they were actually making or fixing the driverless cars. When they finally realized she was wandering around  security had to escort her out. We got scared and we thought we were going to get in trouble or thrown out. Then we met with a friend high up at Google and learned some of the things Google was working on. Nothing was related to search. Everything was related to curing cancer (a bracelet that can make all the cancer cells in your body move towards the bracelet)  automating everything (cars just one of those things)  Wi-Fi eveywhere (Project Loon) and solving other "billion person problems".
