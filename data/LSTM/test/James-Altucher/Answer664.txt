There are a lot of studies that "weak ties" (not your close friends but people who might be friends of friends or acquaintances or Facebook friends  etc) are more beneficial for your career success than your "strong ties". I don't know the reasons for this. We can all guess. But I spend a lot of time cultivating my weak ties. Being there for people who I barely know but maybe have that one moment where I can help. I keep in touch with my weak ties. This is also a great way to build the SOURCE for people who might later become strong ties.
