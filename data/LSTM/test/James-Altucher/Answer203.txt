And then I start writing.Right now the inspirational book is The Untethered Soul. The non-fiction book is Antifragile. The fiction book is Blind Date (Kosinski) and the games book is actually my chess app (Shreder) which has non-stop puzzles. But this list changes almost every day.P) HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?It takes at least six months of coming up with ideas every day before you are an idea machine.Then your life will change every six months. Ive said this before but my life is completely different than it was six months ago  and six months before that  and so on.
