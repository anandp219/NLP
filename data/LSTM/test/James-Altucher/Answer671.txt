Not under promise and over deliver. That's for corporate losers. Over promise and over deliver means you learn  other people get helped  and you exceed even your own expectations of what you can do in your life.You become bigger. And you earn the trust of others. And it's scary and hard and takes you out of your comfort zone. So I guess it all boils down to what's good for you. Even when you SELL  you do it by improving yourself. I guess what I am saying is: I'm grateful this post is in your scorecard  in your source  that you've selected read it  and I hope I am over delivering.
