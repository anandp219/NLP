It was a horrendously strict rule change that forced banks out of business.When did they make this rule change? Late 2007  at the peak of the market. Then the real crash happened: the banking crisis.Everyone begged them to change the rules back. When did they change it back? March  2009. Coincidence? The market went straight up.----In my newsletter coming out on September 1 I give 20. I wish I could give all 20 here but there's not enough space.But three is enough. We covered the main issues: China  Interest rates  and the post-traumatic stress everyone is feeling about 2009.I admit I simplified but this is just a simple post.
