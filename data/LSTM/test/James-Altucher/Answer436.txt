But these things just aren't on a list. A MUST-DO-TO-BE-HAPPY List. BUT then at the end of the day  I do my "I Did" list. Even though only one thing was on my "to do" list. A LOT of things get on my "I DID" list. Because in the 15 or so hours I'm awake  if I spend one hour doing my one thing  I have 14 hours to do a lot of other things  all things I want to do. People I want to be with. Idea lists.Things I'm grateful for.But what if I work a 9 to five job?Ok  that's fine. If you listen closely enough to what your life is telling you  there's a lot of empty silences and pauses.
