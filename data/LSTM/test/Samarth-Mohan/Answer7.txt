  I support Argentina. I really want Messi to win the World Cup and put an end to the "well he hasn't won anything with Argentina" argument used against him every time. I think they have the best attacking line up in the world  with Messi  Higuain  Aguero  Lavezzi  Di Maria  Pastore etc  and are an incredibly exciting team to watch. And going by the way the draw has been set up  I can easily see them in the Semi Finals without having to face any of the other major contenders.Incidentally  they're also the bookmaker's second favourite (after Brazil) with odds of 9/2.
