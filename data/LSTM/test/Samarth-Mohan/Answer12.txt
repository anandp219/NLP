Nothing beats that. That coupled with a regular studying regimen and keeping a regular schedule  should get you through. YOU STOPPED BREATHING DEEPLY!As someone who prepared and got through JEE  let me tell you that the exam is about 50% confidence  and the ability to keep calm under pressure. About 20% of the kids who give the exam any year deserve to get through  but only 2% do  and it is that 2% that manage to keep calm under pressure. Use your nervous energy to good use  keep a tab on your studying schedule and what subjects you need to improve on etc.  rather than focussing on how you can beat all the "boys".As always  Keep breathing.Hugs Your (formerly) Anon Friend.
