  Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy[...] he needs Zoloft for his social anxiety disorder. Why do I say this? Think about it  dear reader. How truly social is Darcy  at any event in the novel (or movie)? He's pretty much a sad  reluctant observer. He remains in the background silently brooding  looking as if he's sitting in the reception room waiting to be called into the dentist's office to have a root canal.By his own admission  he states it is difficult for him to converse at social gatherings. Elizabeth chides him when he confesses by countering with the example of her piano playing.
