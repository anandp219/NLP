These are fun and interesting things we do together--not household chores we do through gritted teeth. (Though  of course  we do those  too. )I'm saddened by how many couples don't work together--except when they have to. If it turned out that my wife and I had no common interests  we'd invent one. I'd say  "You're not into archery; I'm not either. Let's take an archery class together!" Humans form tight bonds by working on common projects. I sometimes fantasize about being a marriage counselor.
