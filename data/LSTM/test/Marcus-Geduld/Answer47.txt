They probably weren't when they were 22. Think about what's going on in most people's lives when they're in their late teens and early 20s. They're usually in the thralls of a complicated  fraught relationship with their parents; they haven't figured out what they want to do for a living; they have little experience living on their own; they don't yet know where they want to live... Trying to wade through all that and be in a serious relationship at the same time is tough. Another way being older helped: I didn't marry any of those good-looking girls who caught my eye--girls I had nothing in common with except physical attraction.
