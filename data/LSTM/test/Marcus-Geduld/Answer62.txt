People would come to see me and say  "Our problem is that ..." And I'd say  "Shut up! Go into that room and don't come out until you've built a playing-card tower together that touches the ceiling!"4. Ignore everyone else. Our marriage is the most important relationship in our lives. We both feel that way. You know the old puzzler? If the ship was sinking and you could only save your wife or your mother  who would you save? Well  I love my mom  but I'm in a partnership with my wife. She always comes first!
