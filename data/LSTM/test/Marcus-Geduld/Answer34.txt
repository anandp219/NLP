I have instincts to do all those things  but my frontal lobes say  "There will be a price to pay if you do." On Quora  common prices stalkers pay are seeming childish to others  seeming dangerous to others  losing the possibility of friendship with others  not learning from criticism  getting kicked off the site  and feeling guilty. When the "you must win at all costs" voice enters my head  the "don't be a dick" voice follows and usually dominates my consciousness. I'm lucky* in that I have strong impulse control.
