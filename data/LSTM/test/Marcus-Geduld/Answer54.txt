)We both agree that there's no such thing as "her problem." There's no such thing as "my problem." Even if it's clear that  by some objective measure  only one of us is at fault--e.g. I blow $10 000 of our saving at a casino--we look on it as a problem with the corporation. It's a problem we both have to solve  together. If she blew the $10 000  I'd be furious  and I'd let her know that  but I wouldn't say  "Shape up." I wouldn't make it all about her  even if I'd done nothing to cause the problem.
