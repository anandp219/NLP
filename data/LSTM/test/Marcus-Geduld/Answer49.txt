I promised to stay with my wife until death and I meant it. To me  marriage was never about "let's try it out and see what happens." I have never had one foot out the door--not even one toe. And (2) I am willing to do what it takes to make the marriage work. I don't expect it to be easy. I don't take it for granted. I think of my marriage as a creature that needs care and tending. I feed it every day. I look for signs of problems. This is more important than the first point! It's great to feel a sense of commitment  but I really know how to solve--or at least how to begin to solve--some problems.
