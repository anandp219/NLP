This was another area when marrying older helped. I didn't have those sorts of illusions. I knew long-term relationships take work. Here  I have to return to luck  again. Marriages don't work when only one partner is devoted to solving problems. Luckily  my wife is as devoted to it as I am. She wants the marriage to work; I do  too. (I am probably making it sound like it's this horrible monster we have to tame every day. It's not. We're best friends and we mostly have fun together. But in a 22-year relationship  there are bound to be ups and downs.
