My wife and I talk about everything. And I mean everything. We talk about feelings of attraction outside the marriage; we talk about our fears; we talk about our irritations; we even talk about our bowel movements. There's no such thing as TMI in our marriage. I guess we give up some mystery  but we gain a ton of intimacy. I've come to realize that it's important that we talk things out immediately. If I suddenly realized I was bisexual and really needed to experience sex with a man  I would be terrified to tell me wife.
