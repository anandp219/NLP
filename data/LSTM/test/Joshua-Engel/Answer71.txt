But that could happen with any series; there's no special reason it should come from Star Trek. Indeed  the sheer amount of Star Trek "canon" would make it even harder.That said... I'm glad to see Trek back on the small screen. I don't think Trek was well suited to movies. Sure  it had its biggest single success on film... but largely because it had a huge basis to build from. Movies have to be about Big Things  and when Trek went to "God" as its Big Thing  it made some of its worst films. The best Trek film (by broad consensus) is about aging and friendship and loss  themes that worked because they had spent years building up those friendships to lose.
