Some of the greatest heroes of the first age were Men (Beren and Turin)  and Luthien and Beleg were Sindar  not Noldor. Morgoth was always predisposed to cowardice. Despite his power he rarely showed his face. But his armies grew stronger all through the First Age  while Elves and Men seemed to roughly hold steady. Morgoth's dragons grew bigger  and eventually even flew. It's unlikely that the Eagles would have held them off.So I'd say the Noldor didn't really hinder Morgoth all that much. Perhaps Men and Sindar (and Eagles and Ents) would have stepped up; perhaps they would have been wiped out 500 years sooner than they were.
