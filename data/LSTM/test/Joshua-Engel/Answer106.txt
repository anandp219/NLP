  If the lottery is properly designed  then "no". The whole point of a properly designed lottery is that it pays out less than it takes in. If it were mathematically possible for one person to beat that  then other people could as well  and the lottery would lose money.It is possible to use math to determine if a lottery is improperly designed. That's what happened in the Cash WinFall lottery. It had a fairly complex system to ensure that it didn't take in too much money  and some weeks it would pay out more than it took in.
