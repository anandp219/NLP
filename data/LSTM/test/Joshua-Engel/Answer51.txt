  The short answer to the question is "no": there is no Slavic influence on Tolkien's work. It just wasn't his area of interest or expertise.The question is incorrect in some of its assumptions. Welsh and Finnish were used as the phonological bases of some of his Elvish languages  but these aren't related to Anglo-Saxon at all. Tolkien himself liked using Anglo-Saxon root words and idioms when he could  and at one point imagined that his stories of Middle-earth were being told by a writer who spoke Old English.
