His death seems like comeuppance  a pretty shallow emotion. Jackson should have aimed for better. All he needed in that scene was to feel what we feel during that song  the heartbreak of a father and ruler who has just sent men to die in a necessary cause  helpless and forlorn. We would understand his despair  and instead of greeting his death with "Good"  we'd say  "Wow  poor thing." That's a much worthier and more interesting emotion  not to mention better in keeping with the book.
