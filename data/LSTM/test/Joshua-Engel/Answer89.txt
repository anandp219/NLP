The same holds for "parentheses"  "appendices"  and "emphases". and There is also a similar Latin transformation that imports the plural of "matrix" as "matrices"For "process"  we did not import the Latin plural along with the word (which would be "processus"). But the spelling "processes" resembles words like "analyses" and "matrices"  and some people incorrectly infer a similar pronunciation rule. A similar mis-generalization affects "biases"  from a French root.It's not "wrong"  exactly. This is English  which is a mishmash of irregular forms and irregular pronunciations.
