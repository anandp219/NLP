  A lot of the things that people call "preservatives" can't be done with high-pressure processing. It won't prevent bread from going stale  for example. It can't preserve colors that fade. It can't prevent oxidation.HPP is good for an interesting array of application  but trying to convert the entire Dannon or Ocean Spray or Sara Lee product line to these would take a massive investment in very expensive equipment. These are commodity producers  with relatively thin profit margins  and whose customers are generally shopping with price in mind.The process has only been widely available for a few years  because it takes extremely high pressure to work.
