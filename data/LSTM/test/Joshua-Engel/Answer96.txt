Just figure out which hot-making techniques go with which basic foods.People get worked up over flavor combinations. Honestly  less is more. Let great chefs worry whether this dish needs a micron more fenugreek. Start with good ingredients  make them hot in the correct way  and let them taste like themselves. Noodles don't taste like much of anything  so they taste like whatever you put on top of them. If what's on top is a good thing  the dish is a good thing.
