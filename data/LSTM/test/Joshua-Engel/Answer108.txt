They can do the math as well as you can (better  probably) to check that the payouts are less than the ticket price. Screw-ups do happen  especially since real-world lotteries often have unnecessary complications (which are supposed to make the game more fun  but usually make the odds even worse for you). But there's no general mathematical tool for predicting the ways that people screw up. You have to look for it  and it's going to be so rare that it's probably more profitable to get a real job with your math skills.If you do want to play a random game where you're actually pitting your math skills against other players  you can try poker.
