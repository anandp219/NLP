Rather  Tolkien was trying to create a distinctively English myth  occasionally trying to tie in bits of mostly-forgotten mythos (like Wayland the Smith) and weave them into the story. Kullervo was an earlier fascination for Tolkien that was later woven in  much as he wove in Tom Bombadil and even Hobbits from other projects he was working on. By the time he was finished  even the "myth for England" largely disappeared as he created his own world.
