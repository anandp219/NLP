  Theoretical resolution of small objects is determined by Abbe diffraction limit. Basically  if a half-wavelength of light can't fit between two objects  you can't tell that they are separate. You won't be able to distinguish the peak of the wave from one from the peak of the wave from another; there is too much overlap.Actual eyesight is never limited by that. Actual eyesight is limited by the quality of the lens in your eye  how precisely you can focus it  and how close you can bring it to the lens while remaining in focus.
