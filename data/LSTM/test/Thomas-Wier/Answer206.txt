  There are actually a lot of cultural differences that most people don't know about -- Louisiana is profoundly different from Virginia  and eastern Oregon might as well be Montana. Collin Woodard wrote about these cultural differences in his book American Nations  a history of 11 Rival Regional Cultures of North America. But rather than just tell you to read that (which you should) I'll go with a nonobvious difference that's pretty identifying: language.Despite the fact that America is a pretty young country  and does not have nearly as much linguistic variation as Great Britain  dialectology does a pretty good job of identifying where you're from.
