There are only two major works:Klimov's Etymological Dictionary of the Kartvelian Languages  which is an excellent source for any Kartvelologist working with old texts or investigating how Georgian relates to Megrelian  Laz or Svan. This dictionary also makes some attempt at noting possible early loans words from Indo-European  Semitic  Caucasian and other languages.Fhnrich's Kartwelisches Etymologisches Wrterbuch  which covers much of the same ground as Klimov's  without however taking much note of any loanwords.In both cases  the vast majority of words that have been borrowed in the last 1000 years or so (and essentially all the huge numbers of words borrowed in the last 200) are not listed because they are not relevant for reconstructing Proto-Kartvelian  which started to split apart more than 3000 years ago.
