It is only when we look at the paradigm as a whole that the question of agreement even comes up: one form demands a certain affix  and the others do not. Controllers  Targets and ConditionsThe simple English example shows that agreement is a matter of specific grammatical contexts (controllers) triggering specific responses in the agreement targets. In some languages  the effect a controller has on its agreement target is absolute: if a subject noun is plural  the verb will agree with the noun in number [1].
