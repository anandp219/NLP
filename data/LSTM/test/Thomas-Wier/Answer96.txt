In fact  many languages have borrowed an even larger percentage of their lexicon from other languages. Albanian for example has over the centuries borrowed over 90% of its word-hoard (to use a good Anglo-Saxon word) from Greek  Italian  Turkish and other Balkan languages. In the limit  in cases of extreme contact  languages can even effectively borrow their entire lexicon from other languages -- we call these languages pidgins and creoles. [1] In such languages  there will usually be a lexifier language like English or Portuguese which provides the words  while most or all the grammar will be borrowed from some other language.
