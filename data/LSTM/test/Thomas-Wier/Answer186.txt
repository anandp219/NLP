The answer almost certainly has nothing to do with the level of 'advancement' of the languages. This idea  called the stadialist hypothesis  was quite popular especially in the Soviet Union in the late 20th century  and held that languages advance through several distinct stages in a unidirectional fashion:First  the most primitive languages start out as Activestative languages. Such languages are more semantically oriented  in that there is no uniform category of 'intransitive subject'; the single argument of some intransitive verbs will pattern in case  agreement  etc.
