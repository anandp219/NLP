Essentially large conurbations are not possible in these regions  leading historically to population pressures and fissuring of communities. But this also leads to a great movement among populations depending on seasonal fluctuations in pasturage  with the result that pastoral communities high in the mountains often speak all the languages at lower elevations  leading to what Johanna Nichols has termed vertical polylingualism: Archi speakers will often speak Lak and Avar (in addition to Russian)  while Lak speakers won't speak Archi  but they will speak Avar (and Russian).
