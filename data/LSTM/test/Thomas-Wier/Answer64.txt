As Tyler Schnoebelen explains  Part of this is to say that some of the languages you take for granted as being normal (like English  Spanish  or German) consistently do things differently than most of the other languages in the world. It reminds me of one of the basic questions in psychology: to what extent can we generalize from research studies based on university students who are  as Joseph Henrich and his colleagues argue  Western Educated Industrialized Rich and Democratic. In other words: sometimes the input is WEIRD and you need to ask yourself how that changes things.In other words  it is quite possible that you are the alien when it comes to linguistic weirdness.
