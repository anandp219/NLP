(In some traditions of grammar writing  such systems are called noun-class systems  but there is no substantive difference between gender and noun-class as metalinguistic terms.) Now  when we talk about gender as a grammatical category  we are implying that there are rules of the language that depend on that category. This means that there must be some sort of agreement  whether morphological or anaphoric  and not just nouns that refer to specific kinds of thing like queen or policeman. Thus  in English  there are no gender affixes to distinguish masculine from feminine genders  but if you say 'The Queen said he's in trouble' you assume that Prince Philip has mouthed off again  because the Queen couldn't be talking about herself because of the anaphoric agreement between the noun and the pronoun.
