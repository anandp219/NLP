Most of these oryxes are on wild game ranches where hunters pay a premium (usually many thousands of dollars) to hunt exotic wild game. This practice is needless to say controversial  but it has been argued that it actually increased the overall size of herds  since ranchers and owners of hunting leases had an incentive to keep herds well-maintained and healthy. Now considerably more oryxes live in Texas than anywhere else in the world. Also as of 2012  the animal has reentered the US government's list of endangered species  meaning that it can no longer be hunted for game.
