Thus  contrary to the question  English does have a gender system -- just one that does not function the same way as French or Russian.The Origin of GenderSo  why would languages even have gender in the first place? The answer has to do partly with noise. When people speak to each other  there is almost always something else going on -- birds singing  doors shutting  other people talking -- and languages have developed all sorts of redundancies to vitiate this signal noise. By having formal devices that redundantly cross-reference the subject matter in a sentence  listeners are much less likely to misunderstand what is being said  and so much less likely to misbehave accordingly.
