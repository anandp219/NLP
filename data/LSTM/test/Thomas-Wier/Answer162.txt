Some scholars have gone further however in arguing that some languages have absolute syntactic underspecification -- all lexical roots can function as all parts of speech  depending on context. David Gil has argued that Riau Indonesian is one such language. Take for example samples from his corpus:(4) a. A noun functioning as the predicate of the clause: Orang bahasa Inggeris sama David? person language English with David  "Did people (speak) English with (you) David?" b. A verb phrase functioning as an argument of the predicate  Tunggu taxi susa sekali  wait taxi difficult very  "Waiting for a taxi is very difficult."
