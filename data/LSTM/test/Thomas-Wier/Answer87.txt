'Verbal ReflexivesOther languages sometimes have suffixes on the verb that carry the weight of the reflexive. Russian is such a language  as you can add the clitic -sya to reflexivize the verb instead of using the reflexive pronoun:(7)    On poranil sebya He wounded himself(8)   On poranilsya He wounded-selfIn Russian this suffix is just a clitic that attaches to the very end of the verb. In other languages such as Georgian or Meskwaki (an Algonquian language spoken in Iowa) the reflexive suffix is more tightly attached to the verb:(9) Georgian: K'ac-ma da-i-nax-a sark'e-i Man-NARR PVB-REFL-see.PF-AOR.3sg mirror-in 'The man saw himself in the mirror.
