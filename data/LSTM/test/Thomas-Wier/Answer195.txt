[1]The distribution of these place names seems pretty pan-European  and so it has been speculated that these place names are the last remnants of some pre-Indo-European language. But if so  it is curious that the greatest density of such place names was in formerly Celtic speaking parts of Europe  such as France  Britain  southern Germany  northern Italy  and central Spain. Since it is also found as far south as Rome in Italy  some scholars believe this root was a relic from the remote time when Italic languages and Celtic languages were still one speech community  some 4000 years ago.
