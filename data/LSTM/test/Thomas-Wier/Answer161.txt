Georgian also has many nouns that are based on participles of different types  either currently or in the past:(3) a.  c'erili 'letter'  < c'er-il-i write-PART-NOM (lit. 'the written thing') b.  damlagebeli 'cleaning lady  housekeeper' < da-m-lag-eb-el-i PVB-PART-clean-TH-PART-NOM (lit. 'the cleaning one') c.  pexsacmeli 'shoe' < pex-sa-c-m-el-i foot-FUT.PART-wear-TH-PART-NOM) (lit. 'for wearing on the foot') d.  sac'oli 'bed' < sa-c'ol-i FUT.PART-lie-NOM (lit. 'for lying down')Although these are synchronically nouns  and so are all marked with a case suffix  they originate as participles which are sometimes considered verbal in nature (depending on one's theory of syntax and morphology) -- they are certainly 'mixed categories' in some sense.
