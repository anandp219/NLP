According to this list  there are some 516 languages that are classified as 'nearly extinct'  though the list is surely different now  since much of the data comes from the '70s and '80s.Given that somewhere between 50% and 90% of the languages of the world will go extinct in the next century  probably a better way to think about language extinction is not just lists  but what can be done to preserve the knowledge within dying languages for future generations:Document and describe endangered languages in all facets of their use;Enact policies and programs that engender stable bilingualism among members of linguistic minority communities.
