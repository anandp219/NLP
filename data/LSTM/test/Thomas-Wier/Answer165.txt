The problem with the Yiddish theory becomes  then  that at exactly the same time that Yiddish speakers were beginning to enter the United States in large numbers (mostly from eastern European territories of the Russian  Austrian and German empires)  an even larger number of non-Jewish Germans were also entering the United States:In point of fact  Germans had already been immigrating in larger numbers since the 1840s. Germans and Yiddish-speaking Jews did not always immigrate in the same way; Jews often ended up staying in large cities  while Germans often moved on inland and became farmers or lived in smaller towns.
