  The oldest attestation of a form of something that might be called English is the almost unintelligible inscription on the Undley Bracteate  a single-sided golden medal that bore an inscription in Anglo-Frisian Futhorc runes  which dates to the 5th century:The bracteate features an image of a Romulus and Remus being suckled by the she-wolf with an image of a Roman Emperor (probably Constantine the Great). The inscription reads:ggog mg meduThis has been interpreted to mean 'she-wolf' (ggog  presumably imitative of the cry of a wolf) and 'mead for kinsmen' (mg medu)  a reference to the bracteate itself being given as a gift.
