  While I am loath to call into question Stephen Tempest's interesting summary of the mythopoetic literature on Roman place names  there is a much more realistic answer available: the 'Alba' in 'Alba Longa' does not mean 'white' at all  but is a relic of a (pre-? )Indo-European substrate root for mountain and river place names found across Europe.Across Europe  there are dozens of very ancient place names that begin with Alb-/Alp-:These toponyms typically fall into two different kinds of geographical features: Rivers and bodies of waterHills or mountainsThus among mountains or mountainous regions we find the Alps  the Alban Hills of Rome  Albania  Alba in the Piedmont of Italy  and both Alba and Albany  respectively Celtic and Middle English names for Scotland (rather known for its mountains)  and famously Albion as a name for England/Britain.
