As I mentioned in that answer  "the earliest proto-cuneiform signs lacked these properties [of case  number  person  etc]: they were merely signs that represented things in the world such as animals  people and certain abstractions like number and size". As Denise Schmandt-Besserat put it [B]efore the invention of writing  compositions typically consisted of geometric or animal motifs that were juxtaposed  dovetailed together  orplaced in rotating arrangements that symbolized an idea or evoked a story.
