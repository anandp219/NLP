Obviously there was some language contact: a few names stayed on like Urartu  an alternate form of Mt. Ararat. The Armenians also adopted a few dozen words from Urartean. Over the centuries  the territories controlled by ethnic Armenians have waxed and waned -- the map in the question is certainly misleading  since it includes only territories controlled by Armenians at the height of their power under King Tigranes the Great. For most of their history  Armenians have either been variously independent kingdoms  disunited principalities  weak vassals of greater powers or they were outright annexed by those powers (Assyria  the Cimmerians  Phrygia  Media  Persia  Macedon  Rome  Byzantium  the Arabs  the Turks)  with no real kingdom or state of their own.BUT  and this is the important point  although they are not truly autochthonous (like say the Georgians to their north) the Armenians have been in Anatolia for over 3000 years  for so long that they are certainly now indigenous to eastern Anatolia and Armenia.As for whether the Armenians peacefully entered Anatolia in 1200 BC  we really have no idea.
