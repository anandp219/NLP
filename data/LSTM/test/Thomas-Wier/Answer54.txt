  An inquorate gender is a gender (or noun class) in a language that is closed  in that new members cannot or cannot easily be added  andhas very few members  generally less than one or two dozen.Maybe the most famous example of inquorate genders comes from the language Tsova-Tush (aka Batsbi). In this language  there are five productive noun genders (five? yes  see my earlier answer: Are there languages that have more than three grammatical genders?) and three genders that have only a small number of nouns.
