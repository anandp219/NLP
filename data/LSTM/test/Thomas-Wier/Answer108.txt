varjiobs 'he exercises')   thus blurring the line between a loan-word and native word. Lastly  there is the issue of an 'expiration date' for how long a loanword continues to be considered a loanword. For example   k'ak'abi 'partridge' was probably borrowed from Hittite or some Anatolian Indo-European language into Proto-Kartvelian  or possibly somewhat later  more than 3000 years ago. Does this still count as a loanword  since we know its source? What about the more recent  bat'oni 'master  mister  lord'  which ultimately goes back to Latin patronus 'master  lord  patron'  but is now the common everyday courtesy title for adult men?
