  Before I even begin with my answer  as a soon-to-be medical doctor  I have to say the following: Don't ask your doc for a date.That said  simply for the sake of his reputation and his job/career  he will most likely reject your advances outright  even if he is into you. I don't know what I would do in his position  but I do know that it would not be an easy matter. Even if I don't fancy her  rejecting somebody causes pain  and most humans are not into that.You are right in mentioning the race dynamic  as it isn't completely irrelevant.
