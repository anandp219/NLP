If we add that up  we get 6.98+5.69  we get 12.67s  i.e. very close to what you actually ran (error less than 1%). Having grown taller  your gains will come primarily in the phase past 30m  so both your maximum velocity (30-50m) as well as the entire 50-100m segment will have benefitted. Most likely  with the natural increase in strength that you surely experienced  your first 30m will have improved somewhat as well. But  how much  is the question. Your stride rate during the race would have been about 4.4 per second  assuming you took strides that were 'natural' for you.
