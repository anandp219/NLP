But he isn't alone  all serious sprints coaches have their athletes go through a rigorous strength program. This is just to bring the point that strength and speed are interdependent.I will even go so far as to say that between specific sprint training without a strength program  and a strength program without specific sprint training  the strength program is likely to contribute more to your speed than the sprint training  especially for beginners who don't have much basic strength yet.Thank you for the A2A  Nam Hong Hoi.
