The degree of recruitment of the various heads also depends on how wide your grip is. The narrower  the more you're focused on the anterior deltoid  the wider  the more the lateral and rear head get involved. Be careful about going to extremes  however  as elbow and shoulder problems can arise from execessively wide grips (or behind the neck variations  the nightmare of a lot of physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons). If you're looking for a bodyweight alternative to the millitary press  I recommend the handstand push-up.
