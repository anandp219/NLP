  I've found that a baby face  especially one that's not obstructed by a beard  leads to more people helping you in a sticky situation. Particularly middle aged and older women seem more inclined to feel sorry for you. You also escape some of the distrust people level at young men  even if you're a person of color. Many people enjoy the feeling of being considered fascinating  and a baby face is the perfect tool to express wonderment. But by far the greatest advantage of a baby face  bar none  is the sneakiness.
