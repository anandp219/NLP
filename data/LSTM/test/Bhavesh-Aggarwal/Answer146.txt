Not all of them are necessarily 100% correct  but the errors likely balance each other out  so the overall result should be correct within about a tenth of a second  provided you perform to your best.To further improve your time  you should focus most on increasing your general fitness with exercise circuits. This will go a long way in staving off the slowdown that comes after the 50m. Also focus on improving your strength  as your acceleration will benefit  leading to higher maximum velocity.Thanks for the A2A.
