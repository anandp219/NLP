South Asia  and the Indian subcontinent in particular  is much more volatile than many people and media outlets would have you believe. As such  the region can only progress when the various countries within put aside their  generally minor  differences  sit around the table  and finally start addressing problems and solutions together. I know the above is somewhat idealistic  although there are increasing efforts of cooperation  which is a good sign.And so  in conclusion  I have the same things to say to the great nation of Pakistan what I would say to any nation  really:Know yourself  acknowledge every part of yourself  accept what is beneficial or irrelevant  and fight tooth and nail the things that keep you from advancing towards a better  brighter  more egalitarian and fairer future.
