For example  the 100m sprinter comes in the 60m type  and the 200m type. Generally  the sprinter 'moving up' tends to be shorter  and more muscular  while the others are leaner  even lanky  in comparison. There are also sprinters who can't easily be classified as either/or.Both types use their upper bodies a lot  but generally speaking  the power type sprinters uses their arms aggressively in the initial phase to accelerate  whilst the strength sprinter uses their arms to maintain form at the end of a race  and stave off deceleration.
