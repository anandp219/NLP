If somebody rejects you or mocks you for not having a beard  know that they are not worth your time. Good people don't disrespect other people without sound reasons.I am a lot like you. Not beard-wise  but I am a short guy in a tall world. I carried that load on my shoulders and in my mind for a very long time. Then  at some point  it clicked. I am short. That's it. That's neither good nor bad  it just is. I can't change it  nor should I try. My value as a person doesn't depend on my height  nor on what other people think of how tall I am.
