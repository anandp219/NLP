Or should I say the spike plate meets the track? har harThe most important exercise sprinters can do to strengthen the muscles  tendons  and ligaments in the ankles and the feet (trust me  that small tissue in your soles is crucial for sprinting) is rope skipping. Barefoot  preferably on grass  even better is sand. Do 200 reps  rest a minute  do another 200  for maybe five sets total. Remember to stay on the balls of your feet  don't bend your knees in the air  or on the ground  and leave the ground as quicky as possible.
