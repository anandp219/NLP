This was about 3 years ago. She signed up  received the kit in the mail  sent it back and waited.When the results came  I was the first to see them  naturally. I gathered everything on paper for her so she could refer to the data when she wanted to look at it again. And later  I'd just bring my laptop to her home and we'd sit around and look at her profile. For someone who is not a "science" person  my mother really enjoyed 23andMe and learned a few things about her health (still allowed at that time) too.
