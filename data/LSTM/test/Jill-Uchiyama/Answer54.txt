  Kindness and selflessness are not designed to make you happy in every way. Striving to be a good person does not necessarily make one happy. It doesn't keep you company through the night. It doesn't pay your bills. It doesn't wake you in the morning with a kiss and a cup of coffee. It doesn't comfort you when you are hurting or when someone is angry  hurtful toward you. It doesn't guarantee you anything in life that is material. But what it does do  if you strive to live such a life  is it gives you peace of mind.
