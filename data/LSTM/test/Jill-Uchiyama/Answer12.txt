  In a country where culture is oriented towards group harmony  group ethics  and a specific hierarchy is strongly adhered to  individuality and independence is very difficult to find and foster. In fact  I would argue that Japanese culture has trouble with asserting individuality and independence. As a teacher in Japan  I had a very difficult time eliciting individualistic responses in conversation. If one person gave me an answer in a conversation group  often the entire group would parrot that answer too.
