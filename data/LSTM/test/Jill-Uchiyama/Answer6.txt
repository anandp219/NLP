Before writing on Quora  I used to be an avid journal writer. Now  I limit my journal writing to once a year- on my birthday. I go to a quiet place  usually near the ocean or in the woods  bring my journal- and write for pages on everything that I've done that year. Usually I include my personal journey  victories I've had  professional leaps  where I started the year and how I ended it. It's a once a year habit that is so well worth it because you can record the highlights  challenges  and victories of your life without needing to commit to an everyday journal practice.
