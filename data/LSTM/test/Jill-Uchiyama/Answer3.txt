It's a precious time to get away and let go of the world and everything in it. You come back to the world refreshed and renewed- ready to see your life and your role in it with completely new eyes.3. Having a dream. This requires you to really be awe-struck with the world and to never get to the place of having  doing or knowing it all. The dream is something you want to accomplish  do  or achieve. It should be hard to come by and not ordinary. Running a marathon  buying an expensive car  doing volunteer work in a 3rd world country  taking a tour of the world  walking the Camino de Santiago- these are difficult to achieve and therefore  dream material.
