Until you get to the root of why you are attracted to such complicated men  you will continue to find relationships confusing  perplexing  and full of pain. What I've learned is that these kind of relationships are not random events. We attract people that treat us like we treat ourselves. When we hold ourselves responsible for other peoples' problems  we are co-dependent. We have lost the plot. We have given up our sense of wholeness. So stop the doubting  and all the confusion. You did the right thing.
