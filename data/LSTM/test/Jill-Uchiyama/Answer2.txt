Many times I asked myself this before a date  for example  and came to the conclusion that I merely just wanted to create something positive. That always happened  even if the date was not someone I would get involved with.2. Going on a retreat at least once a year. This could be any number of things- a meditation retreat  a business conference  a training that you've always wanted- or just a relaxing time away. Making it a habit to go on a retreat at certain times of the year will definitely give you the chance to re-charge your batteries  and above all- decompress.
