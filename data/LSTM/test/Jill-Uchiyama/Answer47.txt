I became aware that it was not just a good book that people should read- but a witnessing that I felt every human being should grapple with if we are to create a new humanity without war  without holocaust  without degradation. To me  this story epitomized all that goes wrong with superiority and a false sense of utopian values. It crystallized so much of who I became in my twenties- and it raised me up- fearfully  yet thoughtfully. As a poet myself  I lost touch with my own sense of poetry after reading "Night".
