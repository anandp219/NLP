  It doesn't matter whether you are fixated on the past  present  or future. What matters is your relationship to your thoughts. One of the functions of ego is a really nasty drone inside of ourselves that basically says  "Something is wrong. Something is missing. Something stinks." It is a faint voice that continually drones on and on. Some people  when they get into a meditative practice can begin to hear that voice and objectify it. This is part of the purpose of meditation- to objectify and get some perspective on the crazy thoughts  and emerging feelings that seemingly well up out of the blue.Once you recognize that you are not those crazy thoughts  that ego  there is room for more liberation inside of you.
