  There is a chance that you will find something useful by joining sites like 23andMe and others. I went from knowing no family members (biologically speaking) to 300 right after I got my results. Were any of them close relatives? No  or shall I say  not yet. The closest relative was a third cousin. But yes  do it. It is worth it. And maybe you will have some luck like I have in finding cousins who are willing to help you explore these connections further. The information I have gained from 23andMe has been invaluable.
