Using healthcare as an example  think about how STEM skills directly apply to every aspect of the industry. The doctors and nurses  for starters  are a gimme. But think about the technology that allows for single-incision laparoscopic gallbladder removal. Think about robot assisted surgery. Think about your electronic medical records and even think about how those simple IV drips work. Think about how you can swallow a radioactive tracer and doctors can watch it on a screen as it works its way through your body.
