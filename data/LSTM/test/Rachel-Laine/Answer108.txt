I think that there is a thick layer of everyday anxiety between me and my creative potential.Getting outside and exercising also helps me clear this thick  suffocating layer of everyday anxiety that stifles my creative potential. I'm not talking about going crazy and running a marathon or climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro. It's the simple things like getting my hands in the garden dirt or feeling the sun on my back while I walk on a peaceful trail. Or floating in the ocean or throwing the ball for my dog in the park.
