I've heard some super curious things about myself over the years. Everything from why I didn't attend such and such event to accusations of things so outrageous it's funny to mundane everyday "front porch" gossip that's far from true. I don't get angry any more or feel indignant. I don't feel resentful or want to bring anyone to whatever sort of crazy justice I wanted a lifetime ago. Why? A few reasons. The main reason stems from my general lack of caring. I don't have enough emotional energy to spend time on things like what people are saying about me.
