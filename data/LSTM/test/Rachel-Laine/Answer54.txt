When the dust is just starting to settle on the battlefield  try thinking about what you want out of the relationship and what your long term goals are for the relationship. Don't focus on whether or not you are sorry that you said that Janet's mother nags too much. Examining your relationship as a whole often has the ancillary benefit of improving your perspective on the event. Do you really want to draw a line in the sand (or set up a fort on the sofa) over x? How important is this? Maybe a lot  but maybe not so much.Sometimes apologies aren't about us and our rightness or personal sense of justice.
