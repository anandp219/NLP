  It is tough to communicate to Western Quorans that driving is unnecessary because sometimes it's not unnecessary and sometimes there aren't better choices. Sometimes there are better choices  of course. I grew up in a very small  rural town in Washington state that was about an hour away from the nearest urban center. There was no public transportation. I did take the school bus to the public school and that was a 45 minute ride each way after a 1 mile walk to the bus stop. Residents relied on their cars to get to work and to retrieve groceries and other necessities.When I was in my 20's I moved to the Bay Area for a job in San Francisco.
