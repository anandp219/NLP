  Gaining a foothold in an established social group can be a really tricky proposition. I have been in your shoes and I know just how lonely and awkward this can feel. You will most likely be "the newcomer" a few times again in your life  so it's probably best to think it through and consider your options. I ran into this situation as a student like you  but also when I started new jobs or joined a yoga group or club. You might find that when you have kids all of the PTA moms and dads have known each other for a million years or that all of the t-ball parents are super tight.
