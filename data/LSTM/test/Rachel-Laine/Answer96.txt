If you want to spend the day exploring the small town of say  St. Helena - visiting tasting rooms  Woodhouse Chocolate  having a meal - it's possible to do this all via slightly inebriated cycling. However  you need to get there first and you need to get back to wherever you are staying. American Canyon to St. Helena is a 45 minute car ride. Same goes for towns like Yountville. Most wineries are rather spread out which makes cycling a poor choice if there are specific wineries that you would like to visit.
