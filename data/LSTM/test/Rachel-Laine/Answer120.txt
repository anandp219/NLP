  Dating is rough  isn't it? The women that I know invest a lot in an evening out with a man  even if they don't pay the dinner tab at the end of the evening. Dates are such a big investment of time  money  and emotional energy that I don't know a single person who would accept a dinner invitation simply for the gratis overcooked steak. The women I know would be more than happy to stay home and eat leftovers in sweatpants rather than spend a terrible evening with Mr. Wrong.You know how nice women look on dates?
