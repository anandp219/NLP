This is very analogous with gossip mongers. Consider them trolls and don't engage or feed them. If you have ever made this mistake you understand why. No one comes out a winner. Everybody looks bad. Everybody loses. Protip: When you do see someone who you think is gossiping about you  there is no need to be rude. A warm smile and simple hello (then move on  of course  no need to have a lunch date) will serve you much better in the long run than an icy look or cold shoulder.
