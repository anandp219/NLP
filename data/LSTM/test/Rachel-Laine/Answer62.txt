  Is the need for students who are competent in science  technology  engineering  and math a fad or trend that will come to an end? Is "S.T.E.M." a bubble that will pop like a Macy's parade float a la Wall Street? Will it all blow over like this newfangled interweb thing? It's much more likely that the U.S. will continue to ramp up their STEM efforts significantly over the next 50 years. Why? Because in spite of the fact that Silicon Valley is a booming metropolis and attracts phenomenal talent from all over the world  the United States is failing pretty miserably when it comes to math and science education.
