Being a strong  powerful  independent woman is important for many reasons - not just because your father doesn't want to support you for the rest of your life. When you are doin' it on your own you have options and choices. The world is your oyster. You get to decide. You get to decide where you want to live  who you want to date  if you want to get married  if you don't want to get married  if you want to have kids  if you want to travel the world -- I could go on  but you get the point. Independence makes your world bigger and gives you more choices.
