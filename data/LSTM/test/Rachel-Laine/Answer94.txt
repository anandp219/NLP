I am great at radiating nervous energy and not so great at ice breaking antics or warmly instructing people to grab a glass of wine. No host wants me on their welcoming committee. It's much better for all involved for me to show up fashionably late after everyone has had a few of those glasses of wine and I can slink into the crowd. Most reserved introverts have cat-like crowd-slinking reflexes. No bellowing or cheek-kissing needed. Speaking of cheek-kissing  it's also in an introvert's best interest to leave before the pack if they wish to avoid the awkward obligatory hugging and child-kissing.
