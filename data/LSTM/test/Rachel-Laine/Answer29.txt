So  if you love a programmer  be prepared to occasionally embrace the trophy. Match his socks correctly and he will bring you flowers. It's true that programmers have their little oddities. J  for example  will not wear socks unless they match exactly perfectly. He says that it makes him feel weird all day long. But  for as many little quirks as he or they may have  they have 10 times more love to give. J shows his love in all sorts of little ways. And he really listens  even when I'm talking on and on about some random Quora answer.
