  Have you ever imagined that your life might be a little bit better or easier in some way if you just had that something? That something that your friend has or the person in the magazine  maybe  and you imagine how wonderful their life is because of it? If you were just 10lbs thinner  you would have a much easier time attracting all of the attractive guys or girls. If you just made 10k more a year  you could live in that desirable neighborhood with the desirable people and their desirable friends.
