  Planning a wedding can be ridiculously stressful. By the time that I said "I do" most of my friends had already gotten married  so I had a chance to witness just how crazy wedding day details can become. A few times brides lost it over minutia like our nail polish colors matching just so. This isn't because they were petty or even inconsiderate people (quite the opposite)  it's because the enormous stress got to them in those moments and they lost perspective. It's easy to let the stress get to you and to lose perspective when you're planning a large  life-changing event.
