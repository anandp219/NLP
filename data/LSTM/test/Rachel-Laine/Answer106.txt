I full-on panicked and wondered how I could be friends with people so callous and cruel. I've never even liked cartoons or fantasy anything. So "creative mode" isn't where I naturally hang out and it takes a little cajoling to get myself there.

For me  a big part of this is being away from the tedium of everyday life and my real life stresses - even the smallest  most insignificant ones.
