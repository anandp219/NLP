Take the time to carefully think through all of the angles of this decision. Are there really only two choices? Would it be possible to enroll in the private school on a one or two year trial basis? Would it be possible to maintain some of the aspects of your life that you enjoy so much about public school and still attend private school? Think outside the box and be creative. Try not to get caught up thinking that public school is "good" and private school is "bad".When making this decision you might also want to think about your long term goals.
