  While he is most certainly alive and kicking  Bill Gates has said publicly that the majority of his mega wealth will be gifted to charities  not to his three children. Each of his three children are set to receive 10 million and the rest of his estimated 76 billion dollar fortune will benefit the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation is the largest private foundation in the world and supports  among other things  world health and education. Another major player who has pledged to give it all away - to none other than the Gates Foundation  primarily - is the Oracle of Omaha  Warren Buffett.
