  The notion that good guys with guns can stop bad guys with guns is not based on the idea that armed bystanders should act as vigilantes. It is based on the idea that victims should have options other than begging for mercy.Firearms are for self-defense  not vigilante heroics.As the fellow in the article said  you don't want to be mistaken for the perpetrator when the police arrive. This is of course a risk even when defending yourself and a loved one  and many of the drills taught in firearm self-defense classes include elements that are intended to minimize that confusion (for example  shouting "drop the weapon" repeatedly).In addition  if you don't know the participants intimately  you yourself may not be able to tell aggressors from defenders  so you could end up making a bad situation much worse.In addition  it is obviously far safer to flee danger than to get involved.
