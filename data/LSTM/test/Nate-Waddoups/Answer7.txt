  Yes  definitely. I'm certain that eventually automation will advance to a point where the cost of production for everything will drop to zero. Human effort  blue-collar or white-collar  will be literally worthless. But no cost of production will mean no cost of goods and services  which will mean no cost required to keep people comfortable. So while nobody will be able to get a job  that won't be a problem because nobody will need a job. I'm confident that humanity will reach that state eventually  but I am not confident that the transition will be a smooth one.Right now  most people work 4-5 decades to earn what they need to support themselves for another decade or three in retirement.
