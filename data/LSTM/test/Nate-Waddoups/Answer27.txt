  Cancer. One could argue that cancer is just a side-effect of a system that works pretty well overall. Evolution created countless species  inhabiting every possible ecological niche. It has been marvelously effective in finding ways to exploit an amazing variety of habitats and energy sources. But evolution also created the potential for cancer  and if you're an individual with cancer  it sucks. It'll probably kill you - slowly  painfully  miserably. It is interesting to look at cancer as a product of evolution on two levels.
