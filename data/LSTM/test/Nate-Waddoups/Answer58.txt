  I consider it good practice because after skateboarding in junior high and high school  my friends and I all got snowboards  had the basics down after just a day or three  and were working on "advanced" stuff like jumps and moguls after that.You learn to balance  and you learn it with a stance and posture that is pretty close to snowboarding. Not exactly the same  but close enough to give you a huge advantage over anyone who hasn't done something similar. You learn to keep your weight between your feet  to lean into turns  to compress when you start to lose your balance  and so on.
