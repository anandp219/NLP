  What is a bisexual lifestyle? I fear that most men interpret that to mean "promiscuous"  as back when I was dating  acknowledging my orientation attracted a lot of men who were only interested in sex. However  bisexual really just means "attracted to both men and women".I am bisexual  and I spent almost 25 years married - I never cheated on my wife. My greatest desire is to be in an exclusive monogamous relationship - I have been fortunate enough to meet another bi woman who also wants an exclusive monogamous relationship.
