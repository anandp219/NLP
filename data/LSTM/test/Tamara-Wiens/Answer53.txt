  I think that there is a bit of truth in your question - but it's a bit of a Catch-22 for Quora. If they showed new users all of the content available  there would be a lot of lower quality answers shown  which may chase away users who would stay if they had better writers showcased.The thing is that new users aren't restricted to just the "top" content - if a question interests you  click on the question header  and you will get to see lots of answers by other users. If you see a writer whose content you enjoy  then upvote and follow them - that's what I did.
