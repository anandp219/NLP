The thing is that  with a few isolated exceptions  the ongoing discrimination against and marginalization of the gay community means that there will be very few people motivated to lie this way. Those that do will likely engage in this for reasons of personal gain - either entree into a community which they find of interest to them  or into roles and jobs that they believe would be hard to get into if they didn't present as gay... And that is the crux of the fractal invalidity of the question. Being transgender is NOT a lie about ones gender.
