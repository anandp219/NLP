  Quora answers are expected to address the question as asked. When a question is difficult or impossible to answer in the form in which you see it  you have a couple of options:Ignore the question. Ask for clarification from the OP in the question comments.Ask for clarification from the OP by private message.Attempt to edit the question and/or details to make the question answerable.What you posted was completely correct... as a question comment. However  it didn't answer the question at all  so it can't actually be considered responsive.In my view  both answers should have been collapsed  and I would have down voted them accordingly.
