  There are some significant problems with the question and details. First is that Canadian retailers open to the public are not allowed to decide who may enter. The only allowable restrictions are for health (shirts and shoes restrictions in restaurants) and product protection (no food or drink) - but the restricted people can enter once they get dressed or finish their meal. I can't restrict Christians from entering my corner store simply because I don't like Bible carriers.Second is the assumption that being LGBTQ is about values or lifestyle.
