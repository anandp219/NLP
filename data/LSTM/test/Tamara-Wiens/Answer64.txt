If only a few of those click through (or if the answer uses words that Google's indexing mechanism finds particularly interesting)  then a SINGLE answer by a person who is NOT an expert will rise to the top.My advice - don't stress it. Quora has multiple systemic problems  and their current approach to dealing with them doesn't give me much hope that anyone who is not part of the "norm" will have a long and successful time on the site. Sorry that I couldn't be more helpful.
