Note that collapses can be automated (by Quora bots)  manual (by admins) or as a result of down votes. Quora has a problem with the granularity of the reasons for collapsing  so your answer may have been caught by a bot or down votes and you wouldn't necessarily know the real reason. There are a number of tools available  and using them correctly will help ensure that you don't get caught by the mechanisms for improving answer quality.
