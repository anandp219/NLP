  I had the same issues with questions about trans people  trans women in particular. Caitlyn Jenner's coming out triggered a flood of trans related questions  many of them incredibly negative. I looked to the Top Writer community for help in downvoting negative/exclusionary answers  and to write positive answers countering the negative perceptions and assumptions.Instead  Quora moderation decided that the best approach was to delete the offending questions  and sanction the users that wrote pejorative answers.
