  In many cases it was threat of outright power and war. The most dramatic of this is the Indian integration of Hyderabad. That kingdom was as big as the whole of UK and Patel's troops annexed it under 5 days with a loss of just 32 men. They called it a "Police Action" to avoid getting attention in the international community It was among the most efficient military operations in history although the whole period before and after the operation was marred with massive atrocities against both Hindus and Muslims.The swift operation by Patel's men and excellent diplomacy by Nehru's meant that UN Security Council could not do much despite all of Hyderabad's and Pakistan's pleading.
