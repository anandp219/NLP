The male actors have to be relatable and thus south Indian boys usually have a major advantage. On the other hand  actresses have no way to show their positives in acting qualities as their roles have become quite limited. Unlike even two decades ago  most of the actresses are brought from the north and the language is no big deal as they are not expected much anyway. They are made to play like dolls and in such a game the hottest light skinned girl wins regardless of how shabby the acting is. Since they have no character requirement to be relatable  homegrown girls don't have much advantage.
