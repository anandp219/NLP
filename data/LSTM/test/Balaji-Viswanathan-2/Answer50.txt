The ambiguity and geopolitical factors of that time probably saved India from sanctions although it later impacted India's technological cooperation with the rest of the world. In 1998  India tested 5 advanced weapons and dropped the charade to declare itself a nuclear power. It again tested the bombs on Buddha's birthday but probably with a wink this time. There was also the politics. In 1998  the bombs were exploded when the right wing BJP was newly in power and US had a lot of uncertainty about the party.
