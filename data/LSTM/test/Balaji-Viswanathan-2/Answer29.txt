  The people who keep overemphasizing the victory of the Labour government in 1945  don't often understand the sequence of steps that led up to India's independence. Labour election sure was important  but it just hastened the process by a couple of years. In May 1945  Lord Wavell [then the Viceroy of India] presented a detailed plan to the Indians for divesting the power. In the plan - Simla Conference - Indians would get full control of everything other than defense and foreign policy. In the government  only the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief would be British and the rest would be Indians.
