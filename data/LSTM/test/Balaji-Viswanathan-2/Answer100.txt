Although Mahatma Gandhi wanted the Indian government to pay what it owed  some twisted this as portraying the Mahatma having his major fast to arm twist the government to pay this money. That is absurd - why would he fast just for paying some amount of money? But  many don't question that. At the end of the day  the extremists some of whom didn't really oppose the partition wanted the Mahatma [the most vociferous opponent of the partition] to act as just a partisan Hindu instead of an Indian.
