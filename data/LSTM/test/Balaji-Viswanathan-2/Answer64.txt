People feel compelled to think beyond themselves and donate for the welfare of some strangers. It enables teamwork among strangers fighting for the same goal. US Army and other armies around the world could attract people who would sacrifice their own lives if needed for the community's welfare  because of this special bond.In modern corporations  we have realized the power of such bonds in enabling teamwork. We thus mimic many of the ideas that nationalists or even religious evangelists used in the past  to build team cohesion.
