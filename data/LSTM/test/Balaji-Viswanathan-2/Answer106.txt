South India has no glacier fed perennial rivers nor such a big plain. The Ganges Basin alone is over 3 times the size of the Godhavari basin and about 12 times larger than the Kaveri basin. The plains of the south are smaller and divided by a number of large forests. Why is this relevant? The size and power of empires depended on the power of agricultural output that could be produced. Thus  northern empires were often much bigger than the southern ones. Also  within such a massive landmass there were frequent opportunity for feud.
