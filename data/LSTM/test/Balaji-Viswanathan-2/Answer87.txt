They brought their ideas and technology and built their homes. Since they were settling permanently they were more vested in ensuring rights  liberty etc. Other colonial settlers were not settling for good and out there to make a fast buck out of the resources and markets.

At the same time  other colonial powers didn't always wipe the native cultures as much as the English did at that time.
