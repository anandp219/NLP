It is unclear whether Ives had any knowledge of Haba or Wyschnegradsky. The microtonally tuned two manual piano was also used later by Wyschnegradsky  however  his earlier quarter-tone piano works (for example Op.5 Quatre fragments from 1918 and Op.10Variations sur la note from 1918-1920) call for two instruments similar to Ives' pieces for the same reason-- compromise for practicality.
