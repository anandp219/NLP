In my early works I had to limit myself to a few basic tones  out of respect for what was practically realisable: in vain makes do with only the 12 tones of the traditionally tuned scale. Natures mortes uses only six different overtone chords  of which four are based on tones found in the traditionally tuned system. In limited approximations  thanks to the pianos  the whole world of sound is open to me.In his paper Some Theoretical Attributes of 72-tone Equal Temperament and Their Realization in Georg Friedrich Haas' limited approximations  Will Mason also details the significance of composer Ivan Wyschnegradsky's arc-en-ciel (1956) as a historical precursor in the six piano 72 EDO realm.
