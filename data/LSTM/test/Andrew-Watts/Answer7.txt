[3]For the boy's voice the real and fake are clearly discernible in their isolated forms through the presence (or lack thereof) of text. The synthesized voice is able to maintain the feel of a human singing through degree of exactitude in sine wave reproduction in overtones. However  it falters in lacking the nuances necessary to physically produce sound in the throat and mouth (inhaling  exhaling  syllabic articulation  etc). For the tenor bell the differentiation is far less straightforward. The envelope of attack of the real bell is often reshaped by Harvey during playback to provide a greater sense of ambiguity.
