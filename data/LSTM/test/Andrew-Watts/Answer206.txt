  It is true that child prodigies get a lot of publicity  largely overshadowing the late bloomers. Honestly  I had a hard time finding counter examples  in part due to the vagueness of early musical training throughout biographies. Within classical music what is considered a late start is still absurdly young when compared to many other fields of study. As a result  a number of articles listing famous musicians who started late consider age 10 as ancient and impossibly disadvantaged in pursing a career as a world class concert composer or concertizing classical musician.
