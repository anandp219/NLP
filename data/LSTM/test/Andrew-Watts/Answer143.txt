Author Brandon LaBelle expounds on this influence  stating that:[...] Lucier infiltrates Young's Dream House  making it a haunted house  whereby phenomenological fact becomes psychological unease; psychoacoustical listening  a sonorous envelope pricked with desire. The liberated sound of Cage  and the phenomenal aesthetic of Minimalism  is on the surface of Lucier  yet what's underneath is the intersection of one man's voice with his immediate environment in which those whistling tones are neither just any or all of the resonances  but only those that are share by both the voice and the room (131-132).
