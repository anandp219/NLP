  In order to determine why something is (or is not) musical  first music must be defined. Unfortunately  there are many definitions for music  often with varying degrees of exclusion or specificity. My preferred definition comes from The Grande dizionario della lingua italiana (ed. S. Battaglia  Turin  1981) and roughly translates to-- The art of combining sounds and coordinating them in time and space  produced by the medium of voice or instruments and organized in many structures according to pitch level  duration  intensity  and timbre; science of sound subdivided into melody  harmony  and rhythm.
