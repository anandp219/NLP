[1] The above Latin text was sung by the composer's son  a young chorister  then the recording was treated to various countrapuntal manipulations. Similar processes were applied to the raw recording of the tolling Winchester tenor bell  creating a plethora of sounds generated only from these two sources. Next  while in residence at IRCAM in Paris  Harvey mapped the natural sound properties of the chorister and bell. Through the use of IRCAM's augmented MUSIC V programing language and with the assistance of Stanley Haynes and Xavier Rodet [2] Harvey was able to create synthesized digital versions of these two sound sources  as well as structure the large-scale pitch motion throughout the work on their characteristic frequencies.
