Another distinction between the first and third movements is the treatment of divisi. In Sul ponte di Hiroshima the string section transitions between various degrees of saturation with divisi  and cannot be reduced to a simple linear gesture (such as one large unison to divisi trajectory). Whereas  Tu does maintain a linear trajectory in the string divisi  moving from unison at the beginning to fully divisi at the finale. Nono also ups the ante within the full divisi texture  which now consists of triple-stops in all the strings.
