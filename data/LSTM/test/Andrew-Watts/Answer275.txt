(Laird)Arthur Berger (1912-2003)  [...]The diatonic skeleton of his music provided a connection with Stravinskian neo-classicism; indeed  Babbitt used the term diatonic Webern in a review of the Duo for cello and piano (1951) and Berger himself hinted at a merging of the two styles in his work when he described the Chamber Music for 13 players (1956) as neoclassic twelve-tone. (Kaufman)Samuel Barber (1910-1981)  The vein of American neo-classicism that entered his music in the 1940s  in such works as the Piano Sonata (1949)  refined his style without changing it fundamentally.
