  In addition to the great examples already here  I suggest checking out the Rachmaninov 5 tudes-tableaux  orchestrated by Ottorino Respighi. As a senior in high school I was quite familiar with these virtuoso piano pieces by Rachmaninoff. However  I was shocked that someone had the audacity to orchestrate such thoroughly pianistic works. Furthermore  Respighi's orchestrations actually happen to be superb  capturing the expressive gestures of the soloist and translating it into the massive machine that is the symphony orchestra.
