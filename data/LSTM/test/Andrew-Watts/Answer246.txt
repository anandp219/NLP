To effectively divide the two channels into four  then finally four into eight 'voices' Reich repeats the phasing process. First  he feeds the current two channel phase into channel 1  again holding it back with his thumb so that it is four quavers away from the original sound and can be heard as a series of equal beats so that it is quite distinct melodically. Next  Reich splices together the two-voice tape with the four-voice tape  then divides it again into eight voices. At this point the voices are  according to Reich  separated it by just a demisemiquaver  so that the whole thing began to shake  then just faded it out and again put those two takes together.
