  It is difficult to state anything about Johannes Ockeghems life with certainty due to the lack of existing original accounts from that time. For instance  his date of birth  though postulated between 1410-1425  is still open to debate by early music scholars. It should then come as no surprise that little is known surrounding Ockeghems life while composing Missa Prolationum  even basic information like the date of the work. The era from the mid to late 15th century is commonly used as a compositional date  but nothing more specific has been confirmed.
