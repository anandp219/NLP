With polystylism  as utilized by Zorn  the influences are necessarily clear in order to provide the listener with a sense of what is being referenced. Furthermore  in Snagglepuss each stylistic outburst must be instantly recognizable  because in order to function as an outburst the durations are inherently quite short. Speed is a crucial factor for Zorn and in the 1998 book John Zorn: Itinerari Oltre Il Suono he said: I believe that in a technological situation like the present one  where we are exposed to thousands of stimuli and in which information moves faster and faster  it is necessary to keep up with these things: it is a way of life and of thinking and we have to come to terms with it.Unlike other post-modern compositions drawing upon many diverse sources ironically  Zorn's inclusion of each musical genre is out of genuine admiration.
