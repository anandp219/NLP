The versions of the Voyager software heard on this recording was designed and written by George E. Lewis  using Forthmacs  a version of Forth-83 written by Mitch Bradley  and MacMox 1.4  a real-time scheduler and MIDI parsing program built by Danile J. Scheidt. Some Forth words designed by Phil Burk for use with the Hierarchical Music Specification Language were also used in this version of Voyager; I hope he wont mind.Software for the session ran on a single Apple Macintosh Powerbook; both the 145 and 180 models were successfully employed.
