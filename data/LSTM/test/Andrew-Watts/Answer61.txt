Thus 10 different intervals arise  each of which becomes the centre of an overtone chord. [...] Melodies recur again and again  wandering from piano to piano  as tremolo  as individual tones  as overtone chords. [An] interval (for example the fifth C-G) sounds in all octaves  but some of these octaves are expanded by a twelfth of a tone. The ear corrects the chord (or tries to correct it)  looked at horizontally  the intervals oscillate in twelve-tone steps  but stay in the same place after all The fact that Haas conceived Limited Approximations as a work of three parts may be a coincidence when comparing it to Ives' 3 Quarter Tone Pieces.
