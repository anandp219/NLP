  [Image via A Tribute to Fausto Romitelli] Trash TV Trance (2002) represents the intersection of a number of diverse streams of compositional thought. On the one hand there is the overarching aesthetic grounding of his work  which most would classify as modernist. Then there are the genres and subgenres he is  at various times  referencing. These range from the popular idioms of rock (metal  acid  psychedelic  etc) and electronica (often via sampling)  to late twentieth century classical movements such as the theater of the absurd and Spectralism.
