The use of illusion in Mortuos Plango  Vivos Voco stems from how Harvey employs the four sounds (original chorister  original bell  synthesized chorister  synthesized bell) throughout the work. Save for a few brief instances during the onset of the composition  these sounds are never fully stated in their basic (prime) form. Rather  the four sounds can be thought of as quadrants on a plane  whereby the musical gestures are represented by the lines between the sectors. From a listener's standpoint  the gradients from one sound to another are manifested in complex timbral transformations.
