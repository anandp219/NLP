Chopin's works often demand substantial physical technique from the pianist. Although both composers treated the instrument with great subtlety and athleticism  the finger independence is much greater in Chopin's show pieces.Nevertheless  there are a few commonalities. Both composers had musician parents  were considered child prodigies  toured Europe as soloists  and died relatively young (Mozart at age 35  Chopin at age 39). However more importantly both: (1) composed a huge catalog of works for the piano including technical studies  (2) had many of their piano compositions enter into the standard concert repertoire  and (3) were highly regarded performers on the instrument  premiering their own pieces.
