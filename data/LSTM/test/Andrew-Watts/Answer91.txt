What we hear  then  is phenomenal in so far as space is articulated by sound  yet imbued with an uncertain psychological imperative  for as Lucier's voice states  the work is a process through which any speech impediment (in this case  his stuttering) may smooth out. It therefore appears that ambiguity is a key component in whether or not something is musical. Schwitters and Lucier approach ambiguity from opposite directions  despite the surface similarities in their text based compositions. For Schwitters ambiguity in syntactic meaning is essential to the construction of the text  and adheres to the first half of the music definition (organizing sounds in time and space).
