in 1897 and "Das Grosse Lalula" in 1905 respectively. In terms of form  Ursonate has a structure similar to that of a classical sonata or symphony. It consists of four movements: Erster Teil ("First Part")  Largo  Scherzo and Presto. This Classical Era structure then shows a clear influence of the major composers of that time: Joseph Haydn  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart  and Ludwig van Beethoven  et al. Schwitters further references the Classical Era in relation to Ursonate by calling it a sonata in his concluding program note in the 1932 Merz publication.
