Lastly  there is the role of the percussion clusters. Durazzi makes a case for their inclusion by relating their role to the "fratello" motive from Luigi Dallapiccola's opera Il prigioniero (194448). Here the tuned metal sheets are tied to the notion of hope that conditions might improve. This motif is borrowed by Nono in a number of works as late as Con Luigi Dallapiccola (1979) for six percussionists and live electronics. Durazzi follows this motivic relationship chronologically back through to the beginning of the final movement of Canti di vita e d'amore  stating: [After] the strong promise of a brighter future  the first sound in the orchestra is a twelve-note cluster played by bells.
