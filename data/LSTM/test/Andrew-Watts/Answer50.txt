In Joseph Yasser's A Theory of Evolving Tonality (1932)  the Ives passage reads: In some century to come  when school children will whistle popular tunes in quarter-tones  when the diatonic scale will be as obsolete as the pentatonic is now  then  boarderland experience may be both easily expressed and readily recognized. Again  the horizontal intervallic opportunities are given the primary focus. The function  as expressed by Ives in the term boarderland experience  may lie in the increased expressivity through greater tonal ambiguity.
