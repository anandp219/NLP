Taylor's work in the 1960s to expand the landscape of jazz into regions of increasing complexity and freer improvisations  as seen with Unit Structures (1966)  contribute to the compositional style and musical language Lewis would later explore in Voyager.

During the 2015 Ostrava Days Composition Institute Lewis mentioned how he had played Cobra  the game piece  with John Zorn.
