07:00PM Return to the kitchen. Again  Spartan mode. If I have leftovers from earlier in the day I will eat that. Otherwise  I will make either the same thing as before or  if low on those ingredients  another quick dish. 08:00PM This is often a critical point. I have been awake for 12 hours and completed enough new material to have run into a conceptual or practical roadblock (musically speaking). I still feel in the zone though  and begin to pace around my apartment while pondering solutions to this issue or issues.
