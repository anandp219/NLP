Nevertheless  it is melodic lines available with this non-traditional temperament that stuck with the young Charles Ives. The composer stated in his writings that after the novelty of the quarter-tone machine wore off it was used as a means of punishment  though we got to like some of the tunes which kept close to the usual scale and had quarter-tone notes.What is perhaps even more telling when it comes to what Charles Ives hoped to gain through the use of microtonality is his prediction for the future.
