These samples are intuitively spliced by the composer  and the points of phase  though appearing to be perfect mathematical ratios in duration  were intuitively approximated as well. These decisions (especially the particular length of each sample spliced from the tape reel)  though lacking continual intervention as the work progresses  do fundamentally shape the moment-by-moment outcomes  altering both the text comprehension and the composition in its entirety. A slight lengthening or shortening of any section of the vocal statement would compound over time and phase  changing one's highly tuned perceptual experience as a listener and speaker of language even with the process itself unaffected.
