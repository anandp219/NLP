  Depending on the piece  indeterminacy and improvisation can be the same thing  however are not always. To clarify it is necessary to look at how these terms are typically defined. According to the indeterminate music entry in The Oxford Companion to Music  [...] the composer has to some degree relinquished control  perhaps by leaving some aspects to chance or to the performer's decision. All music falls within this definition  since musical notation  however detailed  can never prescribe a performance with complete precision; but the term is normally reserved for cases of a conscious abstention from creative choice.
