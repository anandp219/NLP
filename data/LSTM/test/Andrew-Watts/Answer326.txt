As the term spectralism was only coined by Hughes Dufourt one year prior to Mortuos plango and first published in an article one year after the completion of Mortuos plango  it is perhaps best to think of Harveys efforts as proto-spectral or belonging to the late 1970s  early 1980s spectral zeitgeist at IRCAM. In a similar vein  Harveys composition shows a certain dialogue with the acousmatic listening and musique concrete works of Pierre Schaeffer. With Schaeffer the goal was often abstraction of sounds recorded from the natural worlds  divorcing the received meaning from its original source.
