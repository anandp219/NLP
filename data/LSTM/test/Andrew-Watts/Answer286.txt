  In order to analyze different uses of timbral saturation between various works it is necessary to understand the term itself. The concept of timbral saturation could be compared to chromatic saturation. The dodecaphonic works in the early-middle 20th century relied heavily on the saturation of the octave both compositionally and aesthetically  ensuring the appearance of all twelve pitch-classes within a segment of music. This idea of utilizing all available pitches at the same is analogous to the treatment of timbre.
