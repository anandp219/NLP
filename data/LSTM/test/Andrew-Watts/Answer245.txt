Soon thereafter the composer allows one of the parts to phase forward (or the other to phase backward depending on your point of aural focus). According to the 1971 interview with Michael Nyman  this was achieved by Reich gradually holding the supply reel of the recording machine back with his thumb. Reich states  I was literally slowing it down  but at such an imperceptible rate that you can't hear. At the point where the two-channel relationship 'Come out to show them' has separated into 'come out-come out/ show them-show them'  approximately two quavers away by the composer's estimate  he goes on to make a loop from it too.
