Look over the work from yesterday. Usually the efforts that extended long into last night are good  but due to the sleep-deprived / autopilot state  need immediate edits.11:00AM Walk into the kitchen and make something to eat. This is always "Spartan mode" (ramen noodles  PB & J  cold cut sandwich  frozen pizza  etc)  anything that can be prepared very quickly with minimal effort. Oddly  I am not that hungry; too wrapped up in thought I suppose.12:00 Noon Back to the desk. The edits to yesterday's additions are usually done by this point.
