The tone clusters could be seen as dialoging with the works immediately predating Threnody such as the sound-clouds of Iannis Xenakis (ex. Metastaseis  1954) or micropolyphony of Gyorgy Ligeti (ex. Apparitions  1958-1959)  though it is unclear exactly how much their concepts influenced Pendereckis writing. The opening of Metastaseis is a particularly striking similarity to passages of Threnody  with Xenakis texture dominated by the string section split up into 46 separate parts  all completing glissandi at different pitch levels from a union to create a sound mass.
