  [image via Beethoven's Symphonies: Where To Start]Perhaps this was not the intent of the question  however  I read "just a great composer" to be trivializing in tone. Is there something wrong with just being a great composer? Composing is not an easy profession  and composing in a way that leaves a substantial mark on the history of Western music is immeasurably harder still. I find that all biographies of major historical figures in music to be questionable to some degree. How could I be inspired by Beethoven's life  when I have no idea what he was really like?
