Now  keep in mind  that while each choir is a collection of microtonal pitches  these choirs all overlap with each other to form a composite microtonal collection that spans from an Ab in the contrabasses to a high B natural in the first choir of violins. So all in all that is 52 instruments playing individual microtonal notes spanning a range of around 4 octaves. This  without a doubt  creates an incredible amount of force and tension when played. This tension caused by microtonal clusters is found the piece  and is enhanced with Pendereckis implementation of various timbral and Klangfarbenmelodie type effects.
