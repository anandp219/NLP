This approach to the orchestra with the campi sonori may be seen as dialoguing with the historical "sound-cloud"/"micropolyphonic"/"tone cluster" works immediately before it. While it does share the same densely saturated walls of sound covering the quarter-tone steps within larger intervals  there are clear distinctions. Iannis Xenakis' Metastaseis (1954)  Gyorgy Ligeti's Apparitions (1958-1959)  and Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1960) use the clusters as the entire texture.
