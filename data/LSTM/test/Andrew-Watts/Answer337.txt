Regarding this title change  Sarah Wallin quotes Penderecki in the Anthology saying:[The piece] existed only in my imagination  in a somewhat abstract way. When Jan Krenz recorded it and I could listen to an actual performance  I was struck with the emotional charge of the work. I thought it would be a waste to condemn it to such anonymity  to those digits. I searched for associations and  in the end; I decided to dedicate it to the Hiroshima victims. (p.393) Though this rationale for this change sounds honest enough  according to Bannachs research the title change was made for far more selfish reasons:[Penderecki] only ended changing the name after a recommendation from a friend  who advised him that it would make a more emotional impact for his entering in the UNESCO Prize of the International Composers Jury.
