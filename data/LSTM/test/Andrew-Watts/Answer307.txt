Have an opinion and discuss. Many classical compositions are intended to be thought provoking. Seek out those who are already highly knowledgeable about classical music and ask for recommendations. Classical music encompasses thousands of distinct composers over hundreds of years. The differences can be massive  and navigating such breadth can at times feel overwhelming. Talk to people who know more than you (I do this all the time) and ask them to point you towards music you are not yet familiar with.
