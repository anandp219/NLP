For I. Sul ponte di Hiroshima these increases and decreases in divisi effect the microtonal saturation at any given moment. Nono orchestrates using 'pitch bands'  whereby each instrument has a specific confined range  far more exacting and limiting than the typical 'natural' ranges of these instruments. These bandwidths are heard structurally and gesturally as waves entering and leaving the texture. Irvine describes an example of this treatment of microtonal pitches in the opening of Canti di cita e d'amore:The woodwind section never uses microtones  whilst the string have all 24 pitches at their disposal from the very beginning of the first movement.
