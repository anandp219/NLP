When I feel enough of the idea has been realized on the page for me to know how to pick it up again in the morning I try to go to sleep. As I close my eyes thoughts and combinations relating to the composition are still racing through my head. I jump up and run back to the desk to jot things down at least twice before actually falling asleep.The weeks of the year when I am actively writing a new composition I rarely leave my room. I do not compose at an instrument  such as a piano  and therefore do not need to be at an office or studio in order to get work done.
