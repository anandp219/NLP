It is definitely not beginner-level material; it is written for adult native speakers and I wouldn't have been ready to tackle it before studying Chinese for several years. But the story is right up my alley so I'm compelled to keep reading to see what happens next  even if it constantly throws new words and phrases at me.Another piece of advice: use technology to your advantage. Whenever I buy a Chinese novel  I also immediately track down an electronic copy so I can load it into the Pleco app on my iPad and read it there.
