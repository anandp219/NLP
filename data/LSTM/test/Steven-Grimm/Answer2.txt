But the big picture seems to be right in line with the comics.One interesting aspect of this in the context of "how it fits into the MCU" is that  other than a couple prequel comics  it's the first instance of one of the non-movie productions setting up backstory for subsequent movies. Previously  the plot points only ever flowed in the opposite direction. I think that's a positive development for the long-term health of the MCU: it's no longer possible to dismiss the TV side of the universe as a second-fiddle tie-in that never has any impact on the "real" MCU  and cements the vision of the MCU as a single big interconnected whole.
