  Not too differently from how it's done in English. The tonal aspect of Mandarin still leaves people with a ton of ability to vary their intonation; it's all about relative changes in intonation in a single syllable or a pair of syllables  rather than like singing a song where you have to get the pitch exactly right or it's off-key.Here's an analogy that might help make it clearer. When you ask a question in English you raise the pitch of the end of the sentence. Are you able to use tone to convey nuances in the last word or two at the end of a question in English  while still raising the pitch enough to make it very clear that the sentence is a question?
