  Not only is JavaScript used for server development now  but it isn't even an idea that started with Node.js. In the 1990s  a company called BroadVision sold an application server that supported server-side code in JavaScript. But at the time  the state of the art in JavaScript implementations (not to mention the state of the language itself) was not all that great  and the idea didn't really catch on beyond a few early adopters.Today  JavaScript is not only being used directly for back-end development  but it's also being used indirectly as a compiler target for hosted languages such as ClojureScript and Dart  both of which can target either client or server environments.
