  It depends on the bean and how it's used.If your bean is very likely to be required the instant the server comes online  then initializing it during startup is probably the best bet since the server would be unable to do much work without it.If your bean is very lightweight  e.g.  its initialization consists only of letting Spring do dependency injection  then there's little harm initializing it at startup; doing so will make the system's behavior somewhat easier to reason about and easier to debug  and will minimize overhead.However  if you have a bean that's expensive to initialize and that is only used occasionally  especially if it's only used in a non-interactive context like processing batch jobs  lazy initialization may be the right call.
