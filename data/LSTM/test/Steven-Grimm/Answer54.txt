  Singapore has a lot to recommend it  at least from the point of view of a foreigner who's looking for an Asian location. (In other words  someone who is either unaware of  or knows they won't be impacted by  issues that primarily affect local citizens  such as press freedom or the handling of politically sensitive cases in the courts. )Modern infrastructureA clean environment with few food safety issues; potable tap waterAn educated  racially diverse  English-speaking local populationA large Chinese-literate and -fluent population  useful for people who want to do business with ChinaNo capital gains taxes  and a generally very business-friendly regulatory systemA highly stable local governmentA straightforward path to permanent residency  which can be difficult or impossible to obtain in some other Asian countriesLow levels of corruption as measured by international watchdog groupsExcellent air connectivity to surrounding Asian countries and to other continentsIt's easy to see why someone would make a statement like the one in the question  though I think it's a bit grandiose since there are also plenty of other "places to be" in Asia depending on what your goals and needs are.
