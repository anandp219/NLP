You have to grant him a few specific points of suspension of disbelief  but Liu takes those points and really runs with them. Though he's not the first to propose it  his solution to the Fermi Paradox is plausible and well-developed.The "fiction" part doesn't fare as well. All but a small handful of the characters are paper-thin  especially in the first book. This gets better as the series goes on  but I had a really hard time connecting with several of the protagonists. There are large stretches of the first and second books where not much happens  which would be fine in a story with engaging characters  but is not so pleasant with dull ones.
