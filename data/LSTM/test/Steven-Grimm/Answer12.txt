  It really depends on what your actual reading level is -- "beginner" is pretty vague  and if you're a complete beginner with fewer than a few hundred characters under your belt  you will have an extremely tough time making it through any Chinese novel  even children's books. A couple recommendations assuming you're past that level:The Lady in the Painting is a novelization of a folk tale. It assumes the reader knows 300 basic characters; it introduces a few more but mostly sticks to that limited vocabulary.
