If you rely too heavily on them  your brain will train itself to take seconds to recall a single word  and you won't be able to talk to anyone without constantly pausing to recall words. Of course  no matter what  that's going to happen sometimes  but in my experience as a flashcard-using language learner  it'll happen a lot less if you're used to seeing  hearing  and using your new words in the context of a sentence or a paragraph rather than in isolation. Example sentences on the flashcards can help bridge a bit of that gap but not all of it.
