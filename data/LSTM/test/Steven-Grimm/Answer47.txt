It's big enough to have all the goods and services you'd want  but not oppressively huge. If I had to choose any place in China to live  this would almost certainly be my choice. However  I wouldn't recommend it as a stop on a tour itinerary since its charms wouldn't be apparent in a "stop for 2 days and rush around all day seeing the top tourist attractions" scenario.Of course  I haven't been everywhere in China  so maybe there are places I'd rate higher in all of those categories but just don't know about yet.
