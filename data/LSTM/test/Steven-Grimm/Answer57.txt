In some cases I can even guess what the writer's native language is. Most native English speakers who've spent much time reading text by non-natives can probably do the same.But if there are no awkward phrases or grammar errors or strange word choices in a piece of writing  all I can conclude is that the author has near-native-level fluency in English. The absence of the kinds of errors typical of non-native speakers does not prove that English is the author's mother tongue.And here is where it's easy to fall victim to a cognitive bias and a logical error.
