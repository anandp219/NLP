  The rubric that makes sense to me is that: a piece of work can be great only if it utilizes its medium such that it cannot be remade into any other medium.For a visual novel  I would say that one of the conditions for it being considered great would be that it integrates into something more than the sum of its panels and balloon text. If it didn't  i.e  it could work as well as a movie or a novel  then it's not a really great visual novel.I'd actually asked a question about this thought and its significance to comic books a couple of years ago and I'd gotten a response that can serve as a great example of what I mean:Douglas Currens' answer to What are some great examples of comic books that fully utilize the medium?Promethea #32  the final issue of the series  while full of images and comments and "dialogue" on every page  was ALSO designed to be cut apart and reassembled into two very large 16-page portraits of Promethea!
