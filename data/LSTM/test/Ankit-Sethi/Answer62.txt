Fears of the other  darker side of the "Dating" system manifest themselves here - a shiny car we've (as a culture) started test driving with aplomb but neglected to read the operating manual fully. The solution is not to create an environment of self-righteousness about adultery as some kind of social insurance policy in case we're on the receiving end one day  but to realize that it is contingent upon ourselves to choose a partner and build the kind of relationship where it would never come into the equation.The rest of the piece is worth little remark except to say that it unfortunately indulges in the same kind of adversarial world view of modern relationships that I just advocated against.
