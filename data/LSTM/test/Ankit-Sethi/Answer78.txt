  Note: There are assumptions in your question that can be challenged  but I won't since I feel that they aren't consequential enough to be attacked.Two reasons:1. The woman who are "downtrodden" have less time  resources and power to make a presence for themselves in the news and popular media due to systemic historical inequalities  and so you hear and read less about their lives and their work. This is almost tautological. From here  it also proceeds that enacting legislative changes or plotting similar projects aimed to have broad influence on society are many orders of magnitude harder for them.2.
