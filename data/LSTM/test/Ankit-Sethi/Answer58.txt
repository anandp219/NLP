) the criticism easily panders to men who have internalized a fear of the sexually proactive woman and the sexual free-market that feminism and modernization seem to promise ("The whores are coming! The whores are coming! ").they miss the value of asserting and reminding people of the idea that sometimes certain  particular women can be terrible and adulterous but there's no greater meaning in that than what it tells us about their individual personalities. Just as there is a certain sexism in the fact that women are shut out of certain criminal careers like petty theft  contract murders  racketeering etc  there is a sexism in insisting that women should not possibly be just bad people who happen to like adultery.
