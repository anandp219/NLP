I'm not sure what lesson Indian people here took away from it - that desis need to be allies to #BlackLivesMatter and such civil rights causes  or that they need to better educate white people about the differences between their own upstanding gentry and the native troublemakers.And that would be my answer to your question - NRIs are okay with supporting majoritarian parties in India because they generally learn very little from their minority status in the US. They either manage to never feel the downsides of minority status or sublimate it into accidental Islamophobia or accidental anti-black racism which prevents the stinger from attaching to their own group identity.
