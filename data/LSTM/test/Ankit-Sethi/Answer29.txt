The job is both menial and life-threatening. The sand becomes the third character in this two-person drama as it is their only resource - they need to keep working to receive food and water from the village -- while also being a all-consuming force of nature  violating their house  their food  their bodies  and needing constant effort to clean up after and beat back. Junpei initially resists this forced enslavement  but the sand is unclimbable  unstoppable  and starts eroding his dignity as well as his possessions if he even tries to force the villager's hand by not working.
