  Saul is the kind of person that uses his gift of gab to half-blunder his way into what he wants to do/ what he can get. Strategy  for him  is something that starts from a vague impulse and progressively sharpens in real time as he learns what words of his are or are not having an impact on the other person in the conversation.I think he phoned her as an exploratory attempt to see if he could even provide the service Nacho wanted him for - to find out the location of the money. Once he struck out he gabbed his way into letting his conscience speak up and so he ended up warning her about the danger.
