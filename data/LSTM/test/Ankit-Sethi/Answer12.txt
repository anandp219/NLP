  I think what Todd Gardiner said is quite true but after conditioning for that fact and playing a little loose with the term "small-scale"  certain specific answers can be given to this question. My nomination would be Fellini.The contrast between his earlier films like I Vitelloni  La Strada  Il Bidone and Nights of Cabiria and his most famous signature films such as La Dolce Vita  Otto e Mezzo  and Amarcord speaks to exactly the kind of shift you're talking about.Fellini started work in the traditions of Italian neo-realism  working with Roberto Rossellini who was firmly embedded in that style.
