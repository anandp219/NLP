Let me just mention one. In a recent paper by Viola Giulia Miglio  Dr. Miglio reanalyzes the glossary and points out a phrase that had previously eluded translation. The phrase is Sickutta Samaria  serda merina. The meaning of the second phrase  Icelandic  had been clear  defile the mare  but the Basque had not been translated. Dr. Miglio proposes the first word is xikotu and that the phrase  in a more polite translation  means go shag a horse. Sailors have always had a reputation for colorful language and Basque sailors are no exception.From: The Basque-Icelandic Pidgin
