The gender equality issues that are a terrain of politics and negotiation within couples of the Indian middle class are  at this point  a little beyond the zeroth order stuff presented here. There is little talk of sharing chores  of the domestic work being respected as much as professional work  regardless of which spouse is doing it  there is little talk of pay disparities and the negotiations couples must have about who works and which city one lives in and whose career is best prioritized  how in-laws' expectations might need to be readjusted according the progressive values the couple might share  about the need to be each other's allies while doing that  what the effects of workplace sexism on payscale and advancement are  how simple things like lack of public toilets or streetside harrasment affect women's mobility.
