Their "choice" is to stay at home or go out in Islamic clothing. This is an absolutely horrible state of affairs  but exists in many parts of the world.Overall  the question of choice is very difficult to answer primarily because it depends on your definition of choice. There are women who are doing it completely voluntarily  and some who are being forced into it.But what I hope you will take away from all this is that every Muslim woman is an individual  and what she wears is the product of her individual circumstances.
