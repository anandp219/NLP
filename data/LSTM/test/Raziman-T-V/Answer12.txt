Cows are not purely religious items. They are material things  and they mean different things to different people. This is not like the abstract concept of a God. If a Muslim or a Christian insults Shiva  you can say that they are being intolerant and doing this to offend you - Shiva does not exist outside the framework of Hinduism. On the other hand  when they eat beef  they are not doing this to offend your religious sentiments - they are only eating what they consider food.Finally  how can non-Hindus expect tolerance from Hindus when they are not tolerant themselves?The answer is that non-Hindus expect nothing of that sort from Hindus.
