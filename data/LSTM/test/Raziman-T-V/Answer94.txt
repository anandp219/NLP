  Using the fact that K is very small (10)  we can compute this efficiently using matrix exponentiation.Define [math]f(N K)[/math] to be the the number of solutions of [math]1 x_1 + 2 x_2 \ldots K x_K = N[/math]. Let us first find the recurrence for [math]f(N K)[/math].Let [math]i[/math] be the largest value such that [math]x_i > 0[/math] in a solution. The number of such solutions for given [math]i[/math] is just [math]f(N-i i)[/math] since the remaining sum of [math]N-i[/math] has to be made out of terms [math]x_1 \ldots x_i[/math].
