  This problem can be solved using the Convex hull trick.Consider the square of the distance from a producer at [math](a b)[/math] to a point on the x-axis [math](x 0)[/math] where a consumer could be located. This is equal to [math](a-x)^2+b^2=a^2+b^2+x^2-2ax[/math]. We need to find the [math](a b)[/math] pair for which this quantity is minimised. Since [math]x^2[/math] is same for all producers once the consumer is fixed  we will try to minimise the remaining quantity [math]f_{(a b)}(x) = a^2+b^2-2ax[/math] over all [math](a b)[/math] pairs for given [math]x[/math].First  note that [math]f_{(a b)}(x)[/math] is a is a linear function of x for each [math](a b)[/math].
