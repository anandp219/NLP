  Little me would have been very excited and surprised  but a little confused and disappointed too.For obvious reasons  I would let 11 year old (7th standard) mini-me meet the present me.In the top left corner  around the time I started to stop being cute.I think that our conversation would go something like this:R11 : Wow  you got so tall. You are taller than uppa [1].R25 : Thanks. But vava [2] got even taller.R11 : Vava gets to be taller than me?R25 : Yes. A lot.R11 : And you have a beard. It doesn't look very good on you.R25 : Thanks.
