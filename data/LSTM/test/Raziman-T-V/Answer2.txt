Given that even a difference of a few marks results in a huge change in ranks  there is going to be a serious lack of correlation between the ranks and the aptitudes of students. In general  especially with the abundance of coaching centres  entrance examinations do not check how good an engineer/doctor/scientist the student would become but how well they have prepared for the particular examination. I am quite confident that I could have aced the medical entrance if I had prepared for it  and I am equally confident that I would have made a very shitty doctor.Post-graduate entrance exams have less problems with irrelevant topics  but still suffer from flaws.
