Hopefully  the competitive programmers of our time will become faculty at colleges and start coaching the next generation systematically. Hopefully  competitive programming will start picking up at school level and there will be consistent programming culture in colleges rather than sporadic highs when a few good participants happen to be in the same year. Faculty and seniors and the expanding online content dealing with competitive programming will then be able to coach students to the top level.
