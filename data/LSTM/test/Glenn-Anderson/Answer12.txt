  Well  here's the thing. Life on earth started pretty soon after the planet had cooled down. Based on this  I tend to think life forms pretty readily. However  it took about three billion years before we reached complex  multi-cellular life. Maybe this is less common. Maybe many planets don't get beyond this stage. But assuming they do  I'm going to disagree with some others.I think like life elsewhere would be recognizable. I've given examples of convergent evolution in another question: Glenn Anderson's answer to How come we do not see evolution repeat itself to some extent as statistically expected?Here's an example of convergent evolution in three different lineages.
