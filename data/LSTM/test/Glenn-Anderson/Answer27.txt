A reducibly complex mousetrapthe circular reasoning of the concept of Survival of the Fittest (the fittest are those who survive and those who survive are deemed the fittest. This is a conclusion based on an assumption  in turn used to prove the original assumption. )This is an understandable mistake  even Karl Popper himself made it. But to quote him on this subject from: What Did Karl Popper Really Say About Evolution?I mention this problem because I too belong among the culprits. Influenced by what these authorities say  I have in the past described the theory as "almost tautological " and I have tried to explain how the theory of natural selection could be untestable (as is a tautology) and yet of great scientific interest.He then goes on:I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation.
