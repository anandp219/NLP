  When I was about sixteen  for Christmas  a friend of mine got an Atari 400. This was about 1980. Neither of us knew anything about computers  but it came with a BASIC cartridge and some instructions  and we decided to see what it could do.I don't remember but I'm sure we did that standard first program:10 PRINT "HELLO"20 GOTO 10But we decided to try something more ambitious and went with a Dungeons & Dragons character generator. It started pretty simple  and we kept adding to it as we went along.
