  Talk to them openly about it  just as you have done with us here. You'll want to tone down a bit the things that might offend them such as "neither of them have any hard skills that can't be done by myself" - statements like that will not put them in a mood to think of your proposal positively.If there really is that much imbalance  then you could quit today and start a competitor  right? And if that isn't correct  then observe that it isn't exactly true that you don't need them. :)Another idea that could work is to propose that you are named CEO and given a pay package that includes some significant equity which accrues if you hit some ambitious milestones.
