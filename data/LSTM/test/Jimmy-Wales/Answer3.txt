  For the first part of my answer I'm going to assume you mean before the election is over.Probably not. Of the Democratic candidates  I have met Hilary Clinton a few times. Of course I know Larry Lessig quite well - he's a friend.Of the Republican candidates  I have never met any of them as far as I can remember.I live in London  although I do travel to the US quite a bit. But I'm not really all that plugged into the Washington scene.For the second part  I'll assume you mean "eventually". To estimate this I looked at the candidates from 2012 and 2008.
