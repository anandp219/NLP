  I have flown more than almost anyone  in almost every part of the world.If you show up at the airport  wearing normal clothes underneath  and a bathrobe over it  then you'll need to take it off like any other jacket or coat to pass through security.After that  I doubt if anyone will care or even notice. Except your mother.I'm a parent of two very small children  2 and 4.5 as of this writing  as well as a teenager aged 14. When little kids do something provocative or boundary-testing  the best advice that I have learned as a parent is to simply ignore them.
