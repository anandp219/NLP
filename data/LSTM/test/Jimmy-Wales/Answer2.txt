It would be difficult to argue that the old conventions that have led to a largely ceremonial head of state would continue to hold in a Presidential Republic. Given this  I know my vote would be for the Queen over any politician  as I would feel quite comfortable that she wouldn't precipitate any constitutional crisis.
