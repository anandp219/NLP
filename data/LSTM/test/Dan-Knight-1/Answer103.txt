Maybe a particularly vicious strain of Bishops Finger. Chaos would ensue. I mean an alien race might think its the moon - how wrong they would be. If we swapped butterfly wings with jelly  would there be an end to chaos? Or would we all die?How about we swap all the hate in the world with a giant waterslide from the Moon to Earth.Substitute all the advertising in the world for pictures of rainbows and kittens and sparkles.Exchange all nuclear weapons with realistic  life-sized glitter bombs.Switch cigarettes for ten minutes of your life  that seems like a good idea.
