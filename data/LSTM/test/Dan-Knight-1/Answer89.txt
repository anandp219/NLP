There is an undercurrent of drug use because  well  theres little else to do. Burglary is fairly high because its easy to become complacent about privacy. Violence will happen usually as a consequence of alcohol  again because theres little else to do. Drink driving is a problem. The crucial difference to city life here is Ive never felt threatened walking around at night. Ive never been mugged or even approached by anyone asking more than just the time or a lighter. Theres no terrorist threat.Its quiet (obviously).
