  Michael Pennington/ Johnny Vegas immediately springs to mind. Michael describes Johnny not so much as a character  but a voice inside his head. The Johnny Vegas character came from a place of failure. Success was his Kryptonite. For Johnny  if something went wrong with a set  it was because it was meant to go wrong and everyone else was too stupid to see it. He never wanted to play the big gigs  he hated to dumb it down for TV appearances  he loathed the PG Tips tea adverts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Originally Johnny Vegas was created as a way to help control the school bullies  but the witty retorts were always redirected internally.
