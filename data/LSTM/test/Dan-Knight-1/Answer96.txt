It does rather pong and if youre in a car  train or bus  it will hit you in the face like a slap with a trout. Ive gotten used to it over the years  but its been a long uphill struggle to get accustomed to it.Gossip and rumour. Because so little goes on in the rural communities  gossip is rife. There is a demand for people knowing other peoples business  regardless of how petty it is. Theres often a community clique. Sometimes the same people are in the neighbourhood watch  are school governors  run the PTA  belong to the WI  run the Brownies or scouts  etc  and if you don't fit in  both you and your family could get snubbed or at least treated differently to everyone else.Racism.
