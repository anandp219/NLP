Clubs are open to the early hours so I can listen to my favourite genres of music whenever I choose. The comedy circuit isnt a once a year event  its a year round constant - I love comedy and finding new comedians to tickle my funny bone. I can visit museums and galleries and view the works Ive only seen in books or the internet. Theres street art and performances  talks  festivals and theatre.Everything is convenient. I can go out and know I wont need to cut the night short to get home on the last bus/train.
