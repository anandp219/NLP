When you have a relatively low wage  but youre still subject to the same taxes and living costs  you learn to enjoy what you have (with a treat every once and a while). You start to appreciate good memories over material things (which usually end up breaking after a while). This is why I enjoy photography  its a visual representation of a memory. You have an affinity with nature. Within a 20 minute walk Im in the countryside. The rumble of modern society is barely noticeable. Fresh air fills my lungs.
