  I have to crticise the tieing in's with the horror film Alien: a violent portrayal of a face eating aliens directed by Ridley Scott in 1979.The association with a horrific film has no place with the sacarrine world of My Little Pony.There's a mention of Pitch Black - The violent rated 15 film based around the crash landing of the ship Hunter-Gratzner as it transports the violent criminal Riddick to jail.The whole of My Little Pony comic #6? seems to be pretty dark in nature  I certainly wouldn't want my son or daughter to read it if they were of a nervous disposition.
