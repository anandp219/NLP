Owning one of these jackets was like owning the Holy Grail. Record label merchandise was hot property back then  you just werent down with the kids unless you had Technics written across your chest. Kangaroo shoes: Apparently people would use the stash pocket to hide drugs. I used it to store my 50p pocket money. My pair were in the delightful colour combination of red  yellow and blue.The shell suit:Yes  I remember owning one these. Again  it was in red and yellow  but back in the early 90s the garishness was considered wholly acceptable.
