  All music is subjective. I am listening to The Private Psychedelic Reel as I write this  it's certainly a good song  but why?As the name suggests  it pays homage to some of the psychedelic music produced in the 60's/70's and early 90's. The Chemical Brothers have always done well when collaborating with other artists and this song is no exception. Mercury Revs Jonathan Donahue was put to good use in adding an elaborate texture of guitar based  psychedelic  head-mashing madness to the latter half of the track.
