They would then have to set the whole thing up again.The crew spent weeks shooting night and day. The film cost six million dollars and took three months to complete including a full engineering of the sequence.There were six and only six hand-made Accords in the world. To the horror of Honda engineers  the filmmakers disassembled two of them to make the film.The sequence where the tyres roll up a slope looks particularly impressive  but is very simple. There is a weight in each tyre and when the tyre is knocked  the weight is displaced and in an attempt to rebalance itself  the tyre rolls up the slope.
