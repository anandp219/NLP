To my surprise  there wasnt any specific policy about it (unless you call it theft)  so we made one up: no eating from customers plates. Three strikes and youre out. We held a meeting  in which he attended to make sure everyone was aware of the new rule. Simple. And Guess what  within two weeks he hadnt learnt his lesson and was fired. To fall in line with the premise of the question  my place of work is quite relaxed about leftovers/wastage/mistakes. I work in an Italian restaurant where the focus is pizza.
