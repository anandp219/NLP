  This is probably a cultural thing. The only place  where I've seen the claims of Native American being just immigrants  are Quora questions asked by (presumably) Americans. Even though my school history book told something about the assumed origin of Native Americans  it did not say they wouldn't have been indigenous. Interestingly  nations that gained independence from the Russian Empire  or lived near to it  have traditionally called themselves immigrants. Even though Finnish culture and nation were formed in Finland  there have always been questions of "where the Finnish people came"  as if they had been a uniform  established Finnish nation somewhere that then just went to Finland.
