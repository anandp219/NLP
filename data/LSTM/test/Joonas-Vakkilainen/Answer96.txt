  The answer is no  but it is a practical no rather than an ideological no. Languages can for sure be devised but it is a wholly different story to make people speak them. Children acquire their native language from their parents and other people in their environment. Parents usually speak their native language or another strong language to their children. In the case of devised languages  there must be a starting point where people with a native language learn the new devised language and become proficient in it and then start to speak it to their little children  who aquire it as their first language.
