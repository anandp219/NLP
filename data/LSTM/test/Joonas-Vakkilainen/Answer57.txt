The speaker does not explicitly say if he has killed a bear. It is just the negative "feeling" of the clause that supports the partitive object.It is possible to change the object into accusative (some call it genitive-accusative  some only genitive  but I prefer the traditional accusative for clarity)  which makes it the total object and the aspect thus resultative. The context would be for example: kvin usein metsstmss mutta karhun ammuin harvoin  meaning 'I often went hunting but I rarely shot a bear.
