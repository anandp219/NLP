They will perhaps sell you a judogi very soon. It is also good to have slippers  because it is polite  and in many places compulsory  to wash you feet before training  and slippers enable you to walk to the tatami room without getting your feet dirty again. You can also check the dojo etiquette in advance: bow when you enter and leave the hall as well as when you enter and leave the tatami. Martial arts are individual sports (and traditionally they aren't sports at all) so you should be able to go there as you are without any (physical) pre-training.
