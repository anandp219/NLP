If there were  modern Irish would probably be seen as completely different as well as young.Languages change gradually. Some of them have radical and rapid changes  some of them have very moderate changes. Languages with lots of contacts usually change a lot. An old written form does not mean that the language hasn't changed a lot (compare with Chinese) as doesn't a long history in the same location either. A proto-language of newly written language was perhaps as different from the modern language as the written proto-language of another language was.
