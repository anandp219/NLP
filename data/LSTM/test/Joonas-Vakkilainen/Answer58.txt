The English translation can't use 'the bear'  because the shooting is resultative  so the bear must be different at each time. If we change the object into plural  the situation changes. Ammuin karhuja harvoin has plural partitive in the object and is thus imperfective in aspect  and means 'I shot (some) bears'. Plural partitive serves here as an indefinite amount  so the resultative vs. irresultative distinction is not seen. Changing the object into plural nominative  which serves as the definite amount as well as perfective aspect  however  makes it resultative.
