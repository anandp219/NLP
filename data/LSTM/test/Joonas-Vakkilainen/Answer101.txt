  Others have mentioned uchikomi already  but there are other kinds of methods  too. A judoka must know the very basics in order to be able to throw an opponent successfully. One important thing is stance. Jigohontai is a method to observe your stance  the distribution and direction of weight on your knees and the position of your back. Another essential matter is taisabaki. When you throw  you need to get to the right point so that you are in a good balance all the time. Do basic taisabakis alone.
