Why not call Italian an old language? It has been written a lot longer than Finnish  but its literal conventions have just been changed just like its phonology and grammar have changed. Latin was just Italian spoken in the antiquity. It was different from modern Italian just like Proto-Finnic was different from modern Finnish  but because Proto-Finnic wasn't written and Latin was  Italian is seen as a "young language". The same goes with Iris Gaelic: there are no classical literature written in Britonic.
