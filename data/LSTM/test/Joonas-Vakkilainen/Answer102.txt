  Finnish universities don't have tuition fees for anyone. There is now a political debate going on about the tuition fees for students who are not citizens of EEA countries. Foreign students  however  don't usually get student allowance. I need to correct a bit Lyonel Perabo's answer. If you go to Finland to study  you need first a study place. When you have it  you can apply for a residence permit. As far as I know  you don't need to know Finnish or Swedish for that if you are not studying a degree that requires one of the national languages.
