Children who have been raised by animals with no human contact do not acquire a native language because they have lost the sensitive period (if they are not adopted early enough to a human community). On the other hand  adults who want to learn a foreign language should not take a child as their model of learning. That's because  despite the advances of early childhood in language acquiring  children need a long time to become fluent in their language. They need a lot of input from adults as well as they make a lot of mistakes for a long time.
