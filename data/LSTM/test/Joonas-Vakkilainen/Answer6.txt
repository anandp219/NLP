  Yes  the interest for the Chinese language has increased. I can only speak for my own country  Finland  where Chinese has been taken account in education. At a certain grade of elementary school  pupils have to choose a language. Many choose English at this point  but most schools have choices. My school offered English and German  for instance. Nowadays  some schools offer Chinese to be chosen in elementary school. This means that the pupils who choose it will have Chinese classes almost through their whole school life.
