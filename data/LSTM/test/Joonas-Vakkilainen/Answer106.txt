Considering safety  Aikido (particularly Aikikai styles) is a safe art. It does not contain combat and the techniques are not conducted in order to cause harm. Considering the practical side  if this means self defense  Aikido is not a quick way to it. For a practical and multifaceted art I suggest Combat Hapido. It is a hybrid of many other arts and its only focus is on self-defense. It is also classified as a soft art  so it would be both safe and practical.
