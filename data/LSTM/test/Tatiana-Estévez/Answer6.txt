That we are a vulnerable group that need special attention  the focus and responsibility is off men taking control of their actions. I also have concerns that this is something that will be used against women  what happens when you get on the wrong carriage or just choose not to be segregated  will a guy think you must be up for a little attention? This idea was suggested by women to Corbyn  which I dont doubt  because at a very superficial level it seems to offer an immediate solution to a big problem.
