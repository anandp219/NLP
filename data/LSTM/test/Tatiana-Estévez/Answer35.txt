You get it when you stick two fingers up at the Beautiful door and realise that it doesnt really matter which of those doors you go through that the funny and intelligent doors are the ones that have true meaning in life  the cake not the icing. But true body confidence doesnt a beauty cosmetics market make. It is important that when watching any beauty product ad that the more insecure you are  the more money they make. Dont get me wrong  I dont think the Dove marketing team sat around in a team meeting and said to themselves how can we screw with womens insecurities more than theyve already been screwed with.
