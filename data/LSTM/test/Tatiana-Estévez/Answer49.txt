Yours. After a while you will find that even when this person isnt manipulating you  you just feel this general sense of guilt. That youre just not living up to this persons expectations of you. You'll just feel like a generally bad person. This feeling is going to play on any self-esteem issues - which you will have if you're in this situation in the first place. It is worth noting that most people do some of the above things at some point  it isn't necessarily their attempt to manipulate you  most of the time they are actually your mum and they cant help themselves.
