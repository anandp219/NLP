  I've deleted those questions. Revoked the anonymous privileges of one user and banned another user. What users like this are looking for is a reaction - any reaction and any response for them is a result  which is why it is better to give them no response. Quora has a zero tolerance policy to users like this  you must report any content like this  and then message me  so that I can take swift action. You can also @mention me or Marc Bodnick in comments. Thank you Raj Mehta for informing me of this situation.
