Although to some extent this is reflective of most things  but whereas most women wouldnt necessarily value or want a 100 white t-shirt over a 10 or 20 one  Im always surprised how many women are convinced that an expensive foundation is packed with scientific goodness that the cheaper products just dont have. When it comes to the large companies that most of us buy cosmetics from  there isn't as big a difference between premium and mid-priced cosmetics as magazines and adverts would have you believe.
