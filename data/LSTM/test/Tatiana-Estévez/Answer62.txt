  People like free food and when you're on an internship and not earning any money  getting a free lunch seems like a good idea. You could be right and she was hinting that she wanted you to pay  but she might have been hoping you would say 'hey did you know I'm independently wealthy and actually get more money every time I buy someone a lunch  luckily my girlfriend doesn't mind because I'm 100% faithful to her?". If you want to pay for her fine  but don't do it with the expectation that it is significant or it will lead to something.
