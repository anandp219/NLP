  Jeremy Corbyn is currently causing controversy with suggestions put forward that there should be women only train carriages so that they are protected by harassment  with many people feeling that this is taking us back 25 years. This must feel like a real own goal for something that had such good intentions. It was part of a list of suggestions to combat the issue of street harassment for women in the UK and it important issue that needs to be tackled. However he has shown a real lack of understanding in womens issues to think that segregation is progress in the fight against harassment.
