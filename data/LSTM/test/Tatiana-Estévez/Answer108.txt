Younger people  particularly teenagers tend to have a poor sense of smell  so these sweeter scents are more subtle for them than they would be for a more developed nose. Another indicator  but by no means a guarantee is that more expensive perfumes are more likely to have several levels of fragrance. Essential oils (the ingredients of many perfumes  but less likely to be pure in the cheaper ones) are divided into top notes  mid notes and base notes. The top notes you smell immediately and last about half an hour  the mid notes develop after half an hour for 2-4 hours after that.
