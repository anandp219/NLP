  Ethyl alcohol does have a smell  but the fragrances you find in perfumery will easily overpower this. If you have a sensitive nose  you'll be able to pick up the slight alcohol smell  but it is faint. Having said that  most deodorants (at least the ones that I'm aware of) don't have ethyl alcohol in such high quantities. Deodorant gets sprayed on the body  primarily under the arms. A product with such a high percentage of ethyl alcohol would be very drying and it could also sting  particularly for women if they remove their hair from their underarms as this often makes the skin more sensitive and sometimes there are small cuts.
