Please note that although this company may be trying to do you a favour in allowing you to resign in these particular circumstances (i.e. you've only worked there a month)  if you live in a country like the UK that has unemployment benefits there can be a good reason for not doing it like this and that is if you think you won't easily get another job. In this case you will want to 'sign-on' to get benefits and you can only do this is you were fired (you may still be eligible for income support though).
