  The creative director role of a fashion house is a design role and that is the route you will need to go. Working in shops and writing blogs may help you in other areas of fashion but if you want to be a designer  you have to focus on the design side of fashion. To go this route is more difficult than just becoming an established fashion designer. You will need to set yourself up to be better than the rest. The competition you will experience down the road for this is huge. You will need a combination of talent  hard work and tenacity to achieve this.
