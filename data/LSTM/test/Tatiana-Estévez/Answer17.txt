Try convincing Boots that they need to keep that putrid green nail varnish  not because it sells but because it makes the company look oh so trendy to the young folk  but that you want to discontinue pale lilac dove even though they sell 1000 units a week  but the marketing department don't like it because only old ladies are buying it. Yet those are the kind of decisions that the merchandising department will have to make  but there will only be so many loss leaders it can justify  so generally each colour has to 'pull its weight'.
