Most fascinating of course is the use of music for therapeutic purposes. There has been extensive research throughout the world on this. There is good amount of literature in India stating the effect of various raagas in curing illnesses. Oliver Sacks is known to have used music a lot in healing neurological conditions in many of his patients. His work is well documented. I have personally been experimenting with music for long. I have started maintaining a diary of it. I seem to have Chromesthesia  so I wish to get some insights from neurologists some day.
