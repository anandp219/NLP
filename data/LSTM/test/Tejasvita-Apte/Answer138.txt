I have also known (since the time I can remember) that music has a very strong hold / deep impact on me. Sound itself has that effect. Just when I thought I was recovering  I went into a major depressive episode after listening to death metal rock music for a couple of days. Let me be clear  that I happened to like it. Or I wouldn't have listened to it. Despite that  there was a clear relapse. So much so that I found it hard to get out of bed for 3 straight days. (This happened 2 months back). I am not entirely sure if there is any connection between the two but I am too scared to try immediately now!
