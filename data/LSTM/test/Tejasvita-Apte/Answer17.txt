Basically  people unite as Hindus and do constructive things for the society. To me  that's a good thing. Specially  given that no other religion is an exception to this. That is why I cannot understand why Hindus uniting as Hindus is suddenly a problem. For some reason  Indian media has tried very hard to convince people that being Hindu and stating it is something to be ashamed of. Or anti Secular. These people have not bothered to even read the dictionary definition of Secularism. So  I care a hang about what such paid media with ulterior motives say.
