  This question is Compound. I'll try and peel it. Let's address the core beliefs that are untrue and often confused - 1. Firstly  most people think that worrying about others feelings shows that you care. Care shows that you love. If you don't worry  it means you do not care. If you do not care  you do not love.Worrying ==> Caring ==> Love2. Worrying (implied caring and love) about others feelings means complying with their demands. If you do not comply  that means you do not care. 3. Worrying (implied caring and love) about others feelings means giving them a priority over your own.
