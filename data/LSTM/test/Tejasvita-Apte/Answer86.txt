You owe it to yourself to feel whole. So  choose one person. A person who you think will understand. If you don't have any such person  go to a therapist. Talking to a neutral third person is good enough. Confess. Let it all out. Take responsibility but don't overdo it. In my case  I was overdoing it. Classic neurosis. Forgive yourselfRegardless of whether or not your wrong was intentional  it hurt another person. That is pain to someone else at your behest. Feeling guilty is a natural byproduct of it.
