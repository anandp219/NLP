Transform that guilt into remorse. When you feel guilty  it is still about you. "How could I do it?".. "I am the most pathetic person under the sun"... So on and so forth. Wallowing in self-pity. Remorse is when the sorrow for the other person is the base of your pain. It happens through empathy. When you see it all like this  you would be able to forgive yourself. Not to let yourself off the hook easily  but to understand and feel that your actions have the potential of hurting others. With that realization and power comes a huge responsibility of not hurting others and behaving responsibly.
