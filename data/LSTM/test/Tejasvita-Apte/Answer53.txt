The population speaking Sino Indian languages was negligible.The Rest of the population in India i.e. 76% spoke Indo Aryan Languages. Out of these 76%  percentage of people speaking Hindi and its dialects was 44%. See the problem now? The framers chose Hindi because at least a chunk of the population spoke the language. Additionally  the rest of the population which spoke Indo-Aryan languages  understood Hindi for the most part even if they couldn't speak it fluently. Therefore  it has nothing to do with which language is superior or inferior.
