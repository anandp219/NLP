Is it really love? Or is it other things which your mind disguises as love? Introspect well.Most people who don't regret the affair itself either quit from the first relationship (as they probably should)  or merely survive without realizing why. So  introspect. If you truly regret the affair  apologize. No buts  no justifications  plain and simple sorry. Assure him it would never happen again. 3. Sex - Well  given that he is a man  sexual affair for him is the most painful. If you were to have an emotional one  he wouldn't bat an eye!
