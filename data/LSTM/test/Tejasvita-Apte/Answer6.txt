A gem of a book. And I feel the answer to human search in part lies in there. "A man who has a why to live for can bear almost any how"So  making life a meaningful pursuit is on you. It is always a choice. There is no answer written by God in some book as to whether life is a meaningful pursuit or not. If it is  it's still your choice to follow it or not. Viktor Frankl gives a beautiful insight in his book. And I tend to agree with him a lot on it. He says man is a creature of meaning. That above happiness  we search for meaning.
