  I have had quite a funny relationship with my beauty for long. Today  I embrace it. I thank it. And I also accept and allow myself to feel beautiful and be appreciated for my beauty. Before I actually go to my answer  let me make it clear that I wouldn't go to define beauty. Each may have her own definition and I have no right to go tell someone to define beauty according to my ideology. I may think beauty is internal while someone else may think it's about the skin tone. As long as no rights are violated based on that  I don't see a problem with definitions.
