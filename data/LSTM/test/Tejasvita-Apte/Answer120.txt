  Infidelity can either become an opportunity to strengthen your relationship or gracefully move away from one another. There are two parts here. One is your part  the other is his. You can do yours in making him trust you. But he won't trust you fully unless he does his part too. An affair is not the problem. It can be a symptom of the problem. And I say 'it can be'. So  if you both feel (he should feel it in equal measure. I write this answer presuming he feels it in equal measure) that you should be taking this opportunity to strengthen your bond  the following things can be done to get back trust and better your relationship.
