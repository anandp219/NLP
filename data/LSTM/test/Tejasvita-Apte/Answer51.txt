English wasn't spoken by even 1% of the population back then and even today majority Indians prefer Indian languages over English. What's more  that was the language of the colonizers. So  the framers were certain that one of the official languages of India had to be an Indian language. What do you do when you are stuck with a subcontinent where people spoke so many diverse languages? This was the actual situation - There are three groups of languages in India. Indo-Aryan  Indo-Dravidian and Sino-Indian languages.
