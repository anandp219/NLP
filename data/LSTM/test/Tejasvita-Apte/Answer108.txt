Legally  they are not valid. The Supreme Court in the landmark judgment of Vishwa Lochan Madan V. Union of India (1)   dealt with the issue of legality of Fatwas in India. This issue was raised after the harrowing tale of Imrana  a woman from Uttar Pradesh who was raped by her father-in-law. The question arose about her marital status and those of her children born in the wedlock with rapists son. The Fatwa of Dar-ul-Uloom in this connection reads as follows:If one raped his sons wife and it is proved through witnesses  or the rapist himself confesses it  Haram Musaharat will be proved.
