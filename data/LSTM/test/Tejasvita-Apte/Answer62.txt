When men compliment me for my physical beauty I easily find myself blushing (most often if I like them)  or thank them. They saw something nice in me  and that's good. I don't judge them as superficial. I consider it very natural for all of us to appreciate human beauty. My beauty is a part of my personality. I embrace it. I have decided to enjoy it while it lasts. ( Applies equally to both beauty and mind) :)For more of my ideas and thoughts on life  psychology and philosophy  follow my blog - Mindful musings
