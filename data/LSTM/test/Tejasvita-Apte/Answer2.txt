  A government hospital cannot refuse a patient on any ground. On the other hand  a private hospital can refuse a patient on any ground. But neither can refuse emergency medical care. Emergency medical care is a Fundamental Right in India that is enforceable even against private hospitals. Every medical practitioner with relevant expertise is duty bound to save life and provide emergency medical care. In Paramananda Katara v. UOI  a landmark case  the SC held that right to emergency medical care was implicit in Art 21 (Right to life) of the Constitution.
