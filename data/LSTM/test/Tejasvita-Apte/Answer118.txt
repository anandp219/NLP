It shall be in violation of basic human rights. It cannot be used to punish innocent. No religion including Islam punishes the innocent. Religion cannot be allowed to be merciless to the victim.

They can't impose the same on others. So  per se  fatwas are not illegal. But they are not enforceable either.
