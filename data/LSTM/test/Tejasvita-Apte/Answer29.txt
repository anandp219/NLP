  There are two things. I'll start with - Free Will - That 'I' am doing something in all this! The universe constantly tells me that I am NOT in charge. Nothing is in my hands. Any minute anything can happen. As I write this answer  I can die of a cardiac arrest.I mean  literally anything can happen. In fact my personal life has enough evidence that I am not in charge. I still try very hard to be in charge and convince myself that I am! Because if I stop believing that 'I' matter and am in charge  I won't survive anyway.
