However  even with regular smokable bud  you will not need to inhale much to get high. Buy a pipe -- you can get them really cheap -- and start with a tiny hit  filling your lungs to 1/16th capacity  holding it in for a few seconds  then exhaling. Wait about 10 minutes  you should start feeling it. If you want more  take another tiny hit.In addition  when you smoke  make sure you are in a safe place  with people you trust. Queue up some music or a favorite movie (the Harry Potter series is really good when you're stoned)  have some snacks on hand (your sense of taste will be magnified) and avoid alcohol or other drugs.If you decide to go the edibles route  know that these innocuous-looking cookies and candies can pack a wallop.
