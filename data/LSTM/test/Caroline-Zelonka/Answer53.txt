  I am not as lean as I used to be  but I am still very muscular  especially for someone who doesn't lift weights or do any follow any formal strength training routine.In a word: low carb. My core diet consist of lean meat  low-carb vegetables  lots of eggs  low-fat dairy (milk and cottage cheese)  coffee and red wine when I want to drink. (Other than wine and coffee  I drink water almost exclusively. )I avoid most types of sugars  including both refined sugars and high-sugar fruits. I also try to avoid bread  pasta  potatoes  rice and grains -- even whole grains.
