Own it and play it up. Have a streamlined "elevator speech" you can use during the tours phase. "I grew up in Magnolia  I have two younger brothers  I love to play the piano  I love Mexican food but can't stand cilantro." In this phase  you want to be remembered -- in a positive way. (Please make it more interesting than this. )Also  have a little story that has nothing to do with college or rush. Know the unspoken rules. Don't name drop. Don't talk about guys or alcohol/drugs (you can talk about social events  but keep it on the wholesome side.)
