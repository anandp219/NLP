(For example  I just finished up a monthly digest of business news  which involved curating articles written previously by the newsroom and published in the paper  then summarizing them for the digest). They send these digests out free  with the hopes that readers will be intrigued enough to subscribe to the paper  where they can read full versions of stories like this.There are lots of different types of professional writers out there  and I'd venture to guess that there are more on the advertising and marketing side.
