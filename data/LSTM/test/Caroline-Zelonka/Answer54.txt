I use oil and butter in small amounts  I snack on cheese  nuts and beef jerky when I want to treat myself.I still end up eating grains about 3 times a week  mostly due to circumstance -- when my BF makes me dinner. Note that I also made a New Year's resolution to stop dieting this year  so I don't really restrict myself -- though after 30+ years of dietary restriction  my healthy eating habits are somewhat ingrained (no pun intended).As long as I stick to my core diet  and exercise a lot  I can maintain my physique pretty well.
