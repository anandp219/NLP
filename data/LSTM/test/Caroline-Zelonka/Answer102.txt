Not necessarily to work out  but to get an idea of what real people look like without clothing. And I can vouch for this: even the most perfect-looking folks will usually have something odd about their body; a patch of fat in some weird place  perhaps some sagging or scarring. Seeing the spectrum of real human bodies (not just airbrushed fitness models) can give some valuable perspective on one's own looks.I feel this phenomenon has been replicated in some degree by social media and photo sharing.
