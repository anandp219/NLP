This certainly wasn't my experience  and my gut tells me that imagery can be a trigger  but the pathology is driven by something deeper  and blaming media images is trivializing the problem. I also tend to upvote answers where the writer went through the same experience  but processed it in a different way. (How did it feel when you went skydiving for the first time?) This may not be the best example  but we have a lot of questions that are phrased less neutrally. In the skydiving question  a few people noted that "you don't feel like you are falling " which did not ring true for me at all.
