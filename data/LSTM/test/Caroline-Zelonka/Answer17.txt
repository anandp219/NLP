Charge the same hourly rate no matter what you are doing. They want you on a conference call  at a meeting  or to visit a store or whatever? Don't fall into the trap of charging a lower rate for non-writing work. Think of it this way: every hour you are spending on calls is an hour you could be writing for someone else. (Big companies will understand this; smaller ones will balk). Short calls  emails etc.  use your discretion. If it's a huge client throwing me thousands of dollars in work every month  I won't charge for touch-base things  but if they want me on some bullshit two-hour call  you can bet those two hours are put on the invoice.I am sorry if this answer was rushed; I actually am putting off some freelance work due Monday morning in order to write this.
