  I am surprised nobody mentioned housecleaning or maid work. In many cases  these jobs pay sub minimum wage  if you factor in uncompensated travel or break time. Some employers also forbid any eating or drinking on the job  which can also be dangerous in a physically-demanding  non-climate-controlled environment. Add in exposure to cleaning chemicals and repetitive stress injuries and you have a real element of danger to physical health.Barbara Ehrenreich  the social justice writer  spent some time working for Merry Maids housecleaning franchise.
