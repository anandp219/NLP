  I'm going to go with shopping for pleasure. I hear the phrase "retail therapy" and take it to mean shopping  for many  is a fun and restorative experience. For me  it's not like that. My favorite type of shopping -- and by favorite I mean the only kind I can really tolerate  revolves around a deliberate purchase in an uncluttered environment with as few options as possible. The genius of Steve Jobs is that he made shopping more or less palatable to people like me. I'm also OK with online shopping to some extent  though I see almost all shopping as a chore rather than something fun to do.
