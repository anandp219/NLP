For the investment firm  these were people who lived in affluent areas who had "old person" names. (Myrtle and Orville Smith  at a single-family home address in a Ballard ZIP code  for example.) I could reasonably assume  given the phone book information  that the Smiths were older folk who owned their home  and might have a few bucks to throw at a retirement plan.For the software company  I looked in the yellow pages. "Smith & Co. Auto Insurance Agency." Looked like a place that could use some accounting software  maybe.
