He's known for hacking  but his answers on ethics are even more amazing (and highly insightful  based on his life experience).Speaking of ethics  I want to put in a plug for Steve Vettraino and Josh Manson  who write accurately and eloquently about recreational drug use  legal issues and other aspects of the so-called underworld. On a website where there are millions of people who write about technology  careers  colleges  parenting etc.  it's nice to see shared knowledge on topics that don't have a lot of meaningful contributors.When it comes to tech  funding  startups and business stuff  I like Terrence Yang and Patrick Mathieson.
