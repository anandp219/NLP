One thing I see a lot are what I call 'academic answers;' viewpoints based on data and collective wisdom which are technically accurate  but leave a lot of salient things out. I might upvote these answers because the data-based conclusion is a good one  but not necessarily a complete one based on my experience.In these cases  I might disagree with the answer on the basis of what is left out. But again  the importance of what is left out might be a salience issue  and my disagreement may have more to do with me than what is really going on.
