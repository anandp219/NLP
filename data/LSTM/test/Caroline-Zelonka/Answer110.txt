But even ritual work takes its toll on those assigned to perform it. Turnover is dizzyingly high in the cleaning-service industry  and not only because of the usual challenges that confront the working poor: childcare problems  unreliable transportation  evictions  and prior health problems. As my long-winded interviewer at Merry Maids warned me  and my co-workers at The Maids confirmed  this is a physically punishing occupation  something to tide you over for a few months  not year after year. The hands-and-knees posture damages knees  with or without pads; vacuuming strains the back; constant wiping and scrubbing invite repetitive-strain injuries even in the very young.In my three weeks as a maid  I suffered nothing more than a persistent muscle spasm in the right forearm  but the damage would have been far worse if I'd had to go home every day to my own housework and children  as most of my co-workers did  instead of returning to my motel and indulging in a daily after-work regimen of ice packs and stretches.
