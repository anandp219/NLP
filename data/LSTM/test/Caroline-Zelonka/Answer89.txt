  If you want less shiny hair  you need to roughen up the cuticle by damaging it. You can bleach it  then dye it back to its original color  or maybe try washing it with dishwashing liquid or some industrial-strength soap.Alternately  there are hair creams that will give it a matte appearance  as will clays or powders. If you want to go that route  I would experiment with putting different things in your hair until you achieve the desired look. As far as making it grow in wavy  that's impossible.
