Still  I made it through the first few interview rounds.Then came the document checks. The moment the old lady (who looked like she hadn't smiled in years) manning the booth found out I'd been born in China  the large  bold words "CHINA BORN" was written on the top of my application. And unsurprisingly  failed me the very next round. Failing me wasn't the bizarre part. Failing me at the skin check round was the truly farcical bit  given the lack of tattoos  scars  or blemishes. Then again  it may have been that at the age of 23  I was simply too old for them.
