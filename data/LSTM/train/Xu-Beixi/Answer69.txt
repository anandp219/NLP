  It seems to me the teacher could've just removed the class if it were that bad. A lesson doesn't necessarily need to be conducted in one location  or even a classroom. Reading the story above  it sounds incredibly odd that all these people had to be called up. The student probably doesn't fear authority  and after four escalations it should be clear (you know that saying about trying the same thing over and over expecting different results). She likely fears being left out  or not being accepted by her social group.
