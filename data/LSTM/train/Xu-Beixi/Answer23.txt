You must act kindly toward your spouse. Small gestures of warmth  acts of kindness  and efforts to rekindle the romance between you will go a long way toward renewing your bond with one another. Do this from the heart with real commitment to make the necessary changes.Love unconditionally. Somebody has to break out of the negative cycle of eye-for an eye  poor treatment for poor treatment. You need to step out of the insult-for-insult cycle and respond differently. You cannot control your spouses behaviour  but you can control your own.
