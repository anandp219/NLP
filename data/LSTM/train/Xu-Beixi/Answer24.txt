Regardless of how your spouse responds  you must choose to treat them with love. This is not easy to do when your partner is not reciprocating  but it is what you vowed to do when you promised to love each other for better or for worse. And nothing breaks down emotional barriers like unconditional love.Thanks for the A2A  Anon  and best wishes. :)
