  Yes  with or without an immunocompromised family member (though it is very thoughtful of you :)).However  if you are allergic to albumin/egg white or have had adverse reactions to it before  please don't. Or if you are currently sick. The shot will not prevent the common cold (infographic attached in comments). There are many resources available as well  if you wish to read up on effects and side-effects of the shot you are taking. Take care and thanks for the A2A!Seasonal Flu Shot | Seasonal Influenza (Flu) | CDC
