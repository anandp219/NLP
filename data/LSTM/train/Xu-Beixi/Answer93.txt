Inside the Mind of a Psychopath It is likely that psychopaths may not feel happiness as we know it  in all its nuanced forms- the full spectrum from contentment to ecstasy. But rather  they receive elation or feelings of glee from getting their way or getting one over someone else.That said  I believe there are degrees of psychopathy and some psychopaths who are more capable of smaller forms of empathy than others. There has also been suggestion that empathy is like a muscle that can be worked out and improved with time and repeated usage.
