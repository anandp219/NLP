The truth is likely somewhere in between; it is a combination of factors  but the good news is you have influence over all of them. You can change your dating habits. You can find new circles of men. You can learn to spot cheaters  or at least cut them off. You can find enclaves of like-minded people with the power of the internet (or the power of the local YMCA). You can move  if all else fails. You can make yourself better. And the latter should be a lifelong task  with or without potential partners involved.
