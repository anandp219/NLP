  Probably not the worst  but I saw a compilation of this in the library the other day  called Malaysian Politicians Say the Darndest Things  Vol. 2. This one stood out in particular:In response to local girls dating overly-handsome Bangladeshi workers  Minister Mohamed Khir Toyo presented the argument that good looks aren't special (which is false  otherwise every other person would be an Adonis)  and that it's not a "guarantee to happiness" (nothing is). I'm not sure why I'm addressing the meat of his argument in the first place- handsome men will always be attractive to women and to dissuade that just seems silly.
