  I don't know. There aren't a great many studies done on the happiness of psychopaths  but there is some speculation. Firstly:Empathy is key to our normal moral development. Each time you hurt someone  that persons distress becomes your pain  and you start to associate your vicarious pain with harming others. Violence then starts to feel intrinsically bad. Helping others  on the other hand  makes you feel their happiness  and will start to feel good.If you were to lack empathy  this would never happen.
