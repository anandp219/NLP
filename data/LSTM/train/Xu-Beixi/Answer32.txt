If his best behavior is to use those ugly -and fairly misogynistic terms- it seems another nail in the coffin to me.How would have you handled it?Personally  I try to avoid arguments whenever possible to go for a peaceful resolution (also see: Courage the Cowardly Dog). I would've told him when I first started noticing our emotional distancing and having my doubts or being suspicious of his activities. Then we'd have to talk it out. If the relationship is important and worth saving  the necessary work would have to be put in.
