Until you can answer all these questions  I'm afraid there's no answer.While I respect Robert's effort  "straight guys in urban areas do not settle down because they don't think they have to" and that men are all about "the chase" is simply untrue. I've lived in big cities all my life and have been invited to more weddings than I can count (also because math is not my forte)- it's a reflection of the circles you're in  and what values they hold  as well as your culture. And while Jay puts the focus on your deficiencies  I agree it's sometimes difficult to navigate the perilous world of dating  especially in fast-moving urban areas.
