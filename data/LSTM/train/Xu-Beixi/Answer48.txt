  Bhuvi's excellent answer made me think of a recent incident.Bigfoot and I were with a housing agent a few months back. It was the first time I'd met this man; we were basically strangers.At some point  I noticed his fly was undone.So I told him quietly  and averted my eyes as he went off to a corner to zip up. Out of earshot  Bigfoot asked me not to do it again. The rationale being "he would've noticed eventually. Your intentions may have been right but you didn't have to tell him." I think both sentiments are valid  and I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
