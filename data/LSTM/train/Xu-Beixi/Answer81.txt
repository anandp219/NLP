  There isn't such a thing as objective "wife material". All sorts of men have married all sorts of women  and continue to. Sometimes several times over.But it helps to know (in order of your comments):Why are all your dates in "fancy restaurants"?Why do you have sex specifically "4-5 dates later"?Why do you frame your predicament as "I got played so many times by guys who just want sex because of my appearance."? Why do you say "played"? What did these men offer that they reneged upon  and how?How are you certain it is your appearance?Why are the men you meet of such low integrity?
