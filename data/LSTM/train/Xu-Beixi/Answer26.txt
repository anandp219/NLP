  This is known as Premature Graying.There can be quite a few reasons:Contrary to popular belief  stress has not been shown to cause gray hair. Scientists dont know exactly why some people go gray early  but genes play a large role.Also  a vitamin B-12 deficiency or problems with your pituitary or thyroid gland can cause premature graying thats reversible if the problem is corrected  Benabio says.I think this is not down to stress  unless by stress you mean trauma. Since you shared as well- on an anecdotal level  my father and his father both had high-stress jobs; neither grayed prematurely.
