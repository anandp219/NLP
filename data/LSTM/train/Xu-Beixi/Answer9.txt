  It is thanks to the Refractory period (sex).An increased infusion of the hormone oxytocin during ejaculation is believed to be chiefly responsible for the male refractory period. [5] Another chemical which is considered to be responsible for the male refractory period is prolactin [1][6] which represses dopamine  which is responsible for sexual arousal. [6] It is additionally proposed that the gonadotropin inhibitory hormone (GnIH)  which is considered to inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and sexual functions causes refractoriness of the post-ejaculatory refractory period.
