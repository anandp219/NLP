Children should not be born to fulfill a role for their parents; their only job should be to be who they are. The much-wanted daughter of such parents is born with a job to fulfill her mother's fantasies about mother-daughter activities. What if it turns out that she's a huge tomboy  and hates all the activities that her mother dreams of doing with her? She should be allowed the freedom to be a tomboy  without there being a sense that she's "failed" her mother.It values people for gender rather than their inherent worth as human beings  and is the same thinking that ultimately leads to mass infanticide of baby girls in some countries.
