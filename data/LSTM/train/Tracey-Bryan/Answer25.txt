And just as we are  we are somebody else's ideal.If we pretend to be somebody else who we think is more desirable  then we'll attract somebody who likes the person we're pretending to be. Then we have to stick with that pretence  in order to maintain that relationship.It's much easier  and more rewarding  just to be who you are  and find the person who loves you  just as you are. [The other half of the equation  of course  is whether the other person deserves to be loved back  but fortunately for me  I seemed to intuitively make good decisions in this regard  though I know that many don't.
