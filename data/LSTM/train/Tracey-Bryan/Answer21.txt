  I am a long-time fan of Malcolm Turnbull  and have often said he's perhaps the only person on the right side of politics who just might get my vote. So I'm ecstatic at the thought of having him as a PM rather than Tony Abbott.I am concerned to hear that Malcolm Turnbull has undertaken to honour the party's positions on the environment and marriage equality  which he is opposed to. I wonder how long this undertaking is for? If just until an election - which he might call soon - then I can live with it.
