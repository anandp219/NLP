  Because multipurpose aircraft aren't optimised for the mission  so your chance of mission success is lower.Aircraft that can carry a lot of cargo are awesome for transporting equipment into a new theatre; but they tend to be heavy and noisy  so they're not so good for covertly dropping special forces behind enemy lines.Aircraft that can carry a huge payload of air-to-ground weapons are fantastic for destroying bunkers and caves  but generally lack the manoeuvrability to be able to defend themselves against air-to-air threats.Aircraft with huge suites of electronic sensors are optimised for surveillance and intelligence gathering  but sacrifice stealth and payload.You need the right tool for the right job.Obviously  when you have less money to spend  or other limitations such as space available to land on a carrier etc.  you specialise less and might select a compromise.
