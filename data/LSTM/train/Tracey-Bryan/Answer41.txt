I also see families where the much-wanted girl (it's usually a girl in the west) is treated very differently than her older brothers  and is smothered with attention  appears in Mum's facebook more than her siblings  gets lots of new clothes  gets special outings with Mum  etc. To me  that's not OK. Every child should be valued and treated equally (as far as possible  e.g. children with special needs obviously will almost certainly need to receive additional time and attention).It places expectations on unborn children.
