:)Whilst I'm traditionally more of a leftie  I think Turnbull's rise is bad news for the ALP. I think anybody looks better than Tony Abbott. I'm not sure Bill Shorten will stack up as well compared to Malcolm Turnbull. Though that may cause other ALP stars to emerge - I'd love to see Tanya Plibersek take on Malcolm Turnbull at the next election. That'd be a real contest!
