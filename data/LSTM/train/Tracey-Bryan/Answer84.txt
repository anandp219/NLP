  Many people don't  but I think it's a potentially expensive mistake. For most people  buying a home is the largest transaction they're ever going to participate in  and if it "goes wrong"  they stand to lose everything.I've bought and sold more a few dozen times; I still get legal advice on every single contract (and mortgage documents). I've seen a lot who've been burned; it's actually not that uncommon for people to find themselves in unconditional contracts to purchase a property that they can't finance  for example  and they lose a hefty deposit and possibly get sued for damages as well.For the sake of a few hundred bucks  are you willing to risk making a mistake that could cost you everything that you have?
