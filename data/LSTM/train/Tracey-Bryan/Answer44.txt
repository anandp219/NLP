If you are in a relationship and the two of you have the gift of being able to have children without assistance  then there are many unpartnered people  and gay and infertile couples  who envy you enormously. Using limited reproductive services for what I consider frivolous and misguided purposes offends me at a very deep level  and I imagine is offensive to those many people who rely on these services  and would be grateful for any child.In life  I try very hard not to be judgmental. Rightly or wrongly  I just experience a deep failure when it comes to this topic.
