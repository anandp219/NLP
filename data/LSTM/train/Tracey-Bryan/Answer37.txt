As an aside  we don't interoperate with the UK to anywhere near the same extent as the US  and UK forces are optimised for operating in entirely different climates and political environments  with very different equipment and operating procedures. The UK is very Europe-oriented with equipment and procedures  whereas Australia is far more US-oriented. We very naturally and readily form a cohesive fighting force with our US allies. The UK are still very friendly and may send logistical support  or help with specialised things such as intelligence  but are unlikely  in my opinion  to send significant fighting forces.
