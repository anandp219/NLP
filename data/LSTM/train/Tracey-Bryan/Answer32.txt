  There was relatively little resistance. Even those who were initially opposed to the laws largely saw it as an inconvenience that they were experiencing for the greater good. Australia places a very high cultural value on "mateship"  which could be described as "treating your fellow citizens as friends ("mates") unless you have some reason not to  and doing the right thing by your friends  even if it's detrimental to yourself". The gun buyback was sold to the public as something that was painful  but necessary  and consistent with the value we place on mateship.The largest resistance was from farmers  though even they grudgingly accepted that it was necessary.
