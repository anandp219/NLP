  I'm going to start with some examples of people experiencing racial / ethnic identity crises  where the race that they "are" is different from the race that other people recognise them as  or where their long-established self-identification turns out to be based on falsehood. Marlon Brown: black man with albinismSome black people with albinism report finding it difficult to feel fully accepted in black culture  such as Marlon Brown: Confessions of an African-American albinoPale offspring of biracial parents: the Aylmer twinsThe offspring of biracial parents can have a wide spectrum of skin colour  as evidenced by these twin sisters  Lucy and Maria Aylmer:I haven't seen an article where these two talk about their racial identity  but I imagine that Lucy would not be readily recognised as "black" nor Maria as "white"  even though they are twins  and that must be quite confusing.
