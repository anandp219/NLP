The other party is then estopped from denying that the state of affairs exists.For example  imagine that the terms of a lease of a building have been agreed - price  duration  and other essential terms - but the contractual formalities have not yet been finalised. The landlord says "feel free to do a fit-out and move in while the lease is being drawn up". Despite a requirement (in many jurisdictions) that a lease has to be evidenced in writing to be binding  the landlord would be estopped from later denying that a lease agreement existed  on the basis that they had led the other party to believe that the agreement was finalised  and that a written lease was forthcoming.
