  There are vast differences  most of which flow from the primary difference  which is that yields are much lower in Australia. Therefore  making money from Australian property is primarily via capital growth (appreciation)  rather than via rental income. It is nearly impossible to buy property in Australia that will be cashflow-positive at the outset; yields in capital cities are frequently only in the range of 3%  where in comparable areas in the USA they'd be over 10%. My experience has been that yields are around 4 times higher in the United States  as a % yield  to comparable properties in Australia.
