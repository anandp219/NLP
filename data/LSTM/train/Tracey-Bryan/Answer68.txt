at the dog  and continues speaking. Rover is lying in the corner of the room  between the boyfriend and the father  and fortunately  it seems that the father thinks that it's Rover who's farting.A few minutes later  the boyfriend risks releasing a little bit more.Another 15 seconds or so after that  as the odour spreads  the father again hollers: "Rover! "Conversation continues  and the boyfriend is mightily relieved that he seems to have gotten away with releasing some of the pressure in his bowels  without embarrassing himself in front of his girlfriend's parents.Eventually he risks releasing all of the remaining pressure  as quietly as he can.A few seconds later  the father roars: "For God's sake  Rover  move out of the way before this boy shits all over you!"
