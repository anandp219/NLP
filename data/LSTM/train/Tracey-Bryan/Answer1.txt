  I think if I were to anthropomorphise God - which I generally try to avoid  but for the sake of argument - then God would be watching with absolute delight  much like a parent who's watching their child unwrap the best birthday gift ever.God would be watching proudly  and saying afterwards: "I know  right? How awesomely did I design your body? Can you believe that you can have that much fun with it? It doesn't harm anybody else  and you can do it whenever you want! It's just genius  huh? I'm so glad you're taking advantage of it."
