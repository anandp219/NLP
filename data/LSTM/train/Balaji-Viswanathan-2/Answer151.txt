If you had a child who is protesting to get a new car  you might not be able to do much. If the protest is for an extra candy or a book  maybe it could be considered. Third  a protest needs an organization. Who are the other people who are also looking for the objective? The bigger the objective  the bigger is the need for a large organization. At this point it becomes politics. There is nothing wrong with that. There is no way to achieve something without an organization. Is there an existing organization?Fourth  you need to pursue alternative ways of conflict resolution.
