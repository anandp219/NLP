Are there ways you can get close to the objective without a major protest? Are there ways to avoid confrontation? For instance  if I were a kid who wants a book  I might tell my dad that I will forgo candy for the next week. Show your key strengths and the ways in which you get the job done.If you cannot resolve the conflict way with talk  then get on the actual confrontation. It starts with conveying your message clearly. People cannot read your mind. Take the message to as many people. If the objective is reasonable many would share.
