  Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange are both private companies [sometimes people assume they are government organizations like the Reserve Bank]. Think of stock exchanges as eBay or your favorite shopping website. You can buy the same book published by the same company through multiple shopping websites. In the same way  you can buy Infosys stock through multiple stock exchanges. How many shops can you have? Many. As long as you have customers and suppliers. Same for the number of stock exchanges.
