  It is not easy to build a new capital on top of an old city. To create the modern roads and other infrastructure  you need to demolish a lot of existing buildings in that city & it is both expensive and time consuming. There will be a number of court cases and it is a headache. It is better to build a city from scratch  like New Delhi and Chandigarh. That way you have the new city that will be in addition to other cities  nor be a mere replacement. Just as New Delhi subsumed old Delhi  Amaravati would subsume Guntur and Vijayawada - this way providing a taste of the old culture and the modernity of the new city.
