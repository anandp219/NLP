Should an Egyptian be forced to defend their great pyramids? Is a Greek expected to avoid talking about Herodotus or Alexander or any Greek symbol because of a possible (later) connotation with the crusades? Why is an Indian expected to avoid ancient Indian symbols and culture just because some outsider put a "religion" tag over this?Is the "Om" specific to only "Hinduism" or is it spread across a variety of Indian cultures? Where does Indian culture end and "Hindu" religion begin? How do you plan to whitewash Hindu religious elements without whitewashing Indian culture too?
