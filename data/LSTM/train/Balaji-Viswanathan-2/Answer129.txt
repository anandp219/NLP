This can tarnish some of India's reputation. Was India a more tolerant place in the past when schools were vandalized and professors attacked  maimed for remotely "insulting" a religion? How was the academia able to hold its conscience all this long when we have past so much bloodshed from every religious group [How do Indians feel about the many massacres that Indians have committed?]? If we stop our hypocrisy there will be a better fight against actual intolerance. If not  the award returning will have no impact on India.
