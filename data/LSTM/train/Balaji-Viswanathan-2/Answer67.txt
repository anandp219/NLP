Now  not many are talking about the Verma committee. What happened to those 10 proposals? How many of them are done? Who is following up these with the government? Who is making sure India is getting safer for women? None. Like the ice buckets & ALS  it is a fad that is as quickly forgotten as it got viral. That is sad. Because  we have not fixed a real problem there. Celebrities are no better than the common man in these fads. Like pouring the ice bucket  they make a quick statement of whatever is in the trend  make some noise and move on to the next fad.
