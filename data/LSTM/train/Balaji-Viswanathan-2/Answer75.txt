  Asian is a term too broad and is an outdated  Euro-centric way of looking at the world. Every civilization had an equivalent of "others" - people who were outside the civilization and Asia is just one such term [people who were not in Greek world of Europa]. It makes no sense to put Japan and Syria in the same bucket as there is very little connection between the two - no common history  language  race  religion etc. This map is a slightly better grouping of the world. It does a good job in most places.
