China was leading in the game of finishing India's first bullet train that will get a lot of publicity and copycat projects. However  China didn't finance the deal. Japan entered the market with a easy financing deal and pocketed the deal. In this  it was not really different from my car dealer who gave a 0% loan to me to pocket business from a rival.To build the bullet train  you need a lot of things. Some of them will be made in India and the rest will be made in Japan. In the contract  Japan has said that 30% of the things has to be bought from Japan.
