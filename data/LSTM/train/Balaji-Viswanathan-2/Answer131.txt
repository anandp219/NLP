General public has little recognition of the names of those returning the awards and some even accuse those who return as attention seekers [intelligent artists who are long past their prime].Most importantly  the actions just tarnish the name of the nation. If you have a beef with the BJP or Modi  go and fight them  but don't belittle your nation as none of the awards were given by the present government. I have very little respect for anyone who takes domestic politics to tarnish India's image abroad.
