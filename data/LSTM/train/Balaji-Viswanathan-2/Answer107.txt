Such feuds are topics of a number of stories starting from the Rig Vedic Battle of the Ten Kings. South had fighting too  but the landmass provided some natural boundaries for the kings and due to the smaller size the battles were somewhat small too. Given the size and power of the Gangetic valley  it is not surprising that major battles happened there and major empires grew there. Mahabharata and Ramayana are epics about those northern empires. South has its glorious epics too - from the ancient Silapathigaram to modern day Ponniyin Selvan  just that most in the north don't take too much interest in them.
