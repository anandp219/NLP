With better communication and transportation systems  people discovered commonalities in culture that preceded the modern incarnation of the nation. By one view  the nation is an extension of our family or tribe. Just as we feel special bonding towards our kids and immediate kin  we feel special bonds with the nation. These bonds help create the social order we live in. These bonds also help us react to problems in families that have no relationships with ours. The roots of great universities to great charity organizations lie in such bonds - often religious or nationalistic.
