The difference is how many English tried to make the colony as their home vs see it merely as a land for exploitation. South Africa fall somewhere inbetween. At the end of the day  colonization provided two choices - lose all native civilization & culture or lose all of economic power & prosperity. All colonies lost at least one of the two. If the Native Americans & Aborigines lost their civilization & homelands  Indians & Egyptians lost their economic prosperity.
