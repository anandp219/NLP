There will be a large number of exports from Japan to build the bullet train. That is a lot of jobs. Once the line is built  there will be maintenance and adding new train carriages. More exports and more jobs.The Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train is just a starting point. If this works  India will be building advanced trains all over the country. And trains are just one among dozens of new things India will make - new homes  new cities  new factories. Trillions of dollars are at stake here. Like a Venture Capitalist  Japan is trying to enter the market early and capture it before others come in.
