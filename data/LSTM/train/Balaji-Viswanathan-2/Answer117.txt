The west had already burnt its bridges in the 1971 episode and there was very little moral  economic  military or strategic argument that the west could make to stop India from going nuclear. By going nuclear  India is actually able to help its poor. Wars affect poor disproportionately and through the power of nuclear weapons  India was able to stop fighting wars. No one dares bomb a country with nuclear arsenal. India's last full scale war was in 1971. By proving its worth  India got recognized by the western powers on a more equal footing and the resulting large trade since late 90s has helped chunk of poor grow to middle class.The post-nuclear India is far better at protecting its people than the pre-nuclear India.
