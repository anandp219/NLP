This moved them even closer and once US entered the war against Japan  Germany too declared war. Ultimately both fought two different wars. While we simplistically group them as WW2 just because the Allies fought both  there was not much overlap between the Pacific and the Atlantic war. They started and ended on different times  involved different motivations and strategies and didn't even share much of troops or resources due to geographical barriers.
