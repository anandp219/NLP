  Here is my guess as I found no references. Ancient Tamils avoided living next to public squares where multiple roads meet. These places facing major thoroughfare are for public buildings - such as temples and palaces. Due to the large movement of people  these were noisy and possibly even risky to have homes there. A common type of these are Three-way junctions (Muchandi) where the Tamils would not build homes. Facing such a junction is both losing privacy and also extra noise. It makes practical sense.
