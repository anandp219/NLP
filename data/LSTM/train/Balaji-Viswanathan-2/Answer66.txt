  I don't see it going anywhere. Sooner or later some other issue will hog the media limelight and everyone will go after that. Exact same thing happened in case of the rape protests in India  the ice bucket challenges or the Occupy Wall Street in the US. People exaggerate ground reality and have a directionless protest  causing an eventual petering. It could come as early as Nov 8 [Bihar election results] or much later [especially if BJP loses].Two years ago  everyone and their goat commented on rising rape levels.
