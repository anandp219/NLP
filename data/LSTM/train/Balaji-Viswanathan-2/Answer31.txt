The end of war also meant that the Indian soldiers and workers were not needed in as big numbers. Had the British tried to continue past 1947  there would have been chaos for which British government was not prepared for. As the old saying goes  British Indian government would drown in flood if the 400 million Indians were to just spit. By 1947  Indians were prepared for that and from that point it was impossible to govern. The best that was hoped was a respectful exit and continuation of economic ties.
