  Only a small fraction of the Indian Muslims belonged to the ruling class. Among that ruling class  a sizable chunk [such as the Nawab of Junagadh and many Zamindars in Awadh & elsewhere] migrated to Pakistan after the partition. A large section of Indian Muslims come from the lower segments of the Hindu society and thus face the same problems of their peers in the Hindu community. Instead of comparing Hindus v. Muslims as a whole  a better comparison would be comparing two people from the same locality/caste/class background  but only differ by religion.
