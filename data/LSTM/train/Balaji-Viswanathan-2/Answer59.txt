  The premise is disputed. I will still take the bite. India is traditionally resource-constrained  while Europe & US is labor constrained. India has a lot of labor  and Europe-US have a lot of resources. This have an impact on the respective lifestyles.In the US  I can easily afford a Dishwasher  have access to reliable water and lot of electricity. In India  my maid would wash with much lesser water and electricity than that. While driving  I use the automatic in the US as the gas/petrol prices are quite low and the decrease in efficiency is worth the comfort.
