If you build the capital in say Anantapur district  where would you get the water to support crores of future residents to this new capital city? The district is bone dry as it is. You need a massive water source to support a crore people. Historically  great cities have always been built next to rivers or other great water sources. In case of AP  this would have to be Krishna or Godavari. The problem is that every bit of land next to these rivers is fertile & used for agriculture. There is no way to build a great city without taking agricultural lands and that was true of most of the great cities in the world - whether it is Delhi or London or New York.
