For instance  if a labour union fights with a single statement "workers are in pain" it will not get anywhere. If it makes a more specific demand "we need a 5% salary raise because of inflation" there is some scope for negotiations. Successful unions are fairly consistent with what they ask - like it or hate it  they get their way eventually. What are the specific things the protestors of "intolerance" asking? Where can I go and look at the central page for this organization? What are the list of concrete things they are demanding of the government?
