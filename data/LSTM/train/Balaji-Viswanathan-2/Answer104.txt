This was the key feature that helped India throughout history. However  as we need land to build homes  factories and roads  we would have to take a chunk of this arable land. We cannot eliminate poverty without building people homes and jobs. This means India's success or failure will depend on how much of the agricultural land it can take away for other uses & make sure these are utilized well.
