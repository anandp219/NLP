From the late 18th century onwards the situation flipped. It was now the English who were done with the civil wars & revolutions and the rest of Europe picking up the chaos. Englishmen stopped settling outside in droves and in the second wave of colonization - India  Malaysia  Kenya  Egypt - they did like what other colonial powers did. They sent their young men to war  to trade and to rule  but they didn't send their families to settle. This meant that the native cultures were not exterminated  but at the same time the colonial masters had little incentive to think in the colony's main interests - as they were not settling there anyway.
