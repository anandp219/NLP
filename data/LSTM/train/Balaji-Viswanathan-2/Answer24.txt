BSE had no competition back then and its brokers were a closed group of merchants. There was very little technology  transparency or openness. That was not good for country that was just opening up.Thus  in 1992 Narasimha Rao prodded a bunch of government companies such as LIC  IDBI and SBI to create a new stock exchange company with the best of technology available and a much more open system of admitting brokers. Anyone with expertise could become a broker in this new company and not just some nephew of a powerful Dalal street merchant.
