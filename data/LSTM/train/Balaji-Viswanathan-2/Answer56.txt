  India has seen ups and downs throughout its long history stretching beyond 5000 years. For thousands of years  India has had a common culture no matter which empire ruled and which empire fell. Mauryas  Satvahanas  Kushans  Guptas  Palas  Mughals  Marathas  the British Raj and finally Sardar Patel kept rebuilding the pieces after everything fell apart. Lots of people with a limited knowledge of India predicted that the nation would fall apart easily. They have very little clue of the very strong binding forces that underpin India.
