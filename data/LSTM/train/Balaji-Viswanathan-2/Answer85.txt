  In case of the first wave of English colonies (16th-18th centuries)  the people from England settled in those colonies. Not just some men toting guns  but whole families - men  women and kids who made their voyage on Mayflower and countless other ships. Due to a variety of religious revolutions and civil war  many common English folk took these ships as a way out. In contrast  in other European countries there was not as much pain in that period to move whole families out. French  Dutch  Germans and Italians just stayed put at home.
