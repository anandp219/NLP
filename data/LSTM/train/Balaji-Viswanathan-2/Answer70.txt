  Other than the 19-20th century CE  cold weather regions were not really ahead of the economies of warmer regions. Historically  the civilization was centered around warm  tropics & subtropics. The first 5 civilizations - Sumer  Nile valley  Indus Valley  Yellow river valley  Norte Chico - were all in subtropics. The ones that followed - in Greece  Persia  Rome were in the same zone too. [Subtropics often were better than tropics because the latter was often next to dense rainforests with wildlife & epidemic dangers.]
