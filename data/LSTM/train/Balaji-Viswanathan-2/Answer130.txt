In the domestic politics  the award returning is actually counterproductive. The extremists in the right wing want to portray the academia as clueless marxists and by returning the academia is falling right into the trap. You can already hear some right wingers gloating. What this also does is it weakens the moderates within the right wing who want to respect those academics no matter what political opinion they have. On the whole  it might not have that much impact on India. None of the artists who returned those awards have any bit of following in the general public.
