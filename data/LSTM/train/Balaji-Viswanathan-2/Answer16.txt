Andhra Pradesh has an area of 3 95 87 200 acres of which farm lands are nearly nearly two-thirds. It is not running out of farm lands any time soon. Far less than 1% of this farmland is taken away for the capital and all other infrastructure projects. If there is an agricultural crisis it is not due to a shortage of land  but due to mismanagement of water  poor access to technology and lower productivity of the fields. India could potentially double the farm productivity enabling it to cut the arable land by as much as a half in the future.
