  No one expects a civil engineer to rotate the bridge he built  by 90 degrees just because the customer changed his mind. No one expects a mechanical engineer who just designed a refrigerator to now repurpose his device as a microwave oven. On the other hand  customers often expect outrageous changes in their software. While your refrigerator or your car or your home has not changed that drastically in the past 40 years  your software changes quite drastically. Changing to the new requirements that quick means engineers sometimes take shortcuts  quickfixes and hacks rather than reengineering them.
