If I were to design the curriculum  I would just keep poetry  math  logic and personal finance as all other topics can be learned in adult life when basics are set right.The teachers themselves are very poor at investing or any topic related to personal finance. It is hard to get quality teachers who understand topics like investing and personal finance. The good ones in those topics go for more lucrative careers much early in the game.
