  The bodies are stored in Resurrection Ships and the Resurrection Hub.Resurrection Ship with its defensive air wingThere are several such ships  but apparently there is only one Hub. The Hub acts as the central processing center for Cylon resurrection; if the Hub were destroyed  Cylons would be incapable of resurrection until it could be rebuilt  and the Significant Seven do not know how to rebuild it  since it was originally designed and built by the Final Five. The Hub is also where "boxed" Cylons are stored indefinitely (such as the Threes).The show never investigated the question of how or where the actual bodies are produced.
