I want my phone to be a phone. I do not need a little mobile Web browsing device that can also function as a phone. I do not need a little mobile gaming device that also happens to work as a phone. I don't need it to play music or watch TV shows. I don't need to look up song lyrics or post on Facebook. I have computers for that  and an iPad. What I want is a reliable mobile communications hub  for voice as well as text. Blackberry handles text messaging  as well as its outstanding Blackberry Messenger system  very well.
