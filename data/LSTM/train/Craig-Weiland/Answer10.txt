That's money you didn't have to give me. I appreciate it. "The corporate profits belong to the stakeholders. If you want to become a stakeholder in a publicly held company  you can buy stock. As a stockholder you are entitled to profits of the company. As an employee you are not.Gregory Norton's example is a very good one. When you hire a house painter  you agree to what you will pay him for what service he will provide. That arrangement does not entitle him to equity in your home nor any percentage of what discretionary income your own household budget allows you.
