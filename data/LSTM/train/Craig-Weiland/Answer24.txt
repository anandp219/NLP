Its ability to manage multiple email accounts is smooth and effortless. I also love having a physical keyboard  and Blackberry makes the best in the business (but also offers products with innovative virtual keyboards too).As Blackberry is designed to appeal to professionals and not 13 year old girls  its OS is functional  clean and no-nonsense. Exactly what I want.I'm aware that no smartphone is 100% safe from government snooping  but I appreciate that Blackberry is a Canadian company and that makes it one step further removed from US backdoor shenanigans.
