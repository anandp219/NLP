  The best Apple keyboard ever made was the Apple Adjustable Keyboard.I've been using Apple keyboards since the late 80s  and this product  which debuted in 1993  is simply the finest keyboard Apple has ever come out with in my opinion.The keys are based on the same Alps mechanical keyswitches as used in the Extended Keyboard II  having perfect feel  travel and feedback. The Adjustable Keyboard was a radical design which featured a hinge in the middle  which could split the board apart down the center for ergonomic comfort.
