  As others have pointed out  Blackberry was the first* smartphone. It was the first phone that could access email and provide limited Web functionality  which made it indispensable to businesspeople prior to the advent of the iPhone  which completely changed the way people understood and used smartphones. Today Blackberry is less known in the smartphone space because Apple and Android have carved out vast swaths of its previous marketshare. But as a platform it is still quite strong  particularly in other parts of the world  but also among those of usI use a BB Q10 as my "daily driver"who are interested in security  reliability and communications functionality as its core mission.Here's what I tell people who ask me why I went with Blackberry: my phone is not a lifestyle.
