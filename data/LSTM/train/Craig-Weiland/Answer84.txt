The opening theme of Battlestar Galactica (reimagined series) was completely changed partway through the first season.Besides  there was nothing at all wrong with the title music of Firefly. It was perfectly appropriate to the visual and dramatic themes of the show. Sorry you didn't like it  but most of us fans disagree with you.
