  I have two negative connotations that immediately come to mind.One is it sounds like a feminine form of "Eugene"  which to me  will always be this:Grease  1978Poor Eugene is the guy wearing the bow-tie. To me the name is synonymous with unfortunate  socially awkward  fashionably clueless. I'm sure there are plenty of great guys out there named Eugene who are anything but the character in the film shown here  but that's what I think of when presented with the name.The second connotation is more serious.
