In 2014  this cooperative celebrated its 100th year. I was tasked with creating a graphic identity for the centennial event  at the center of which was a logo. For that year  this logo was on absolutely everything we did. As part of the Centennial  a lot of historical research was done. I got to see a great deal of photography  artwork and artifacts spanning the last century  all with the company's branding. I feel particularly lucky to be here  doing this job  at this particular point in time. Because the work I did for the Centennial is now a part of this proud organization's history  and it will continue to be  for as long as it lasts.
