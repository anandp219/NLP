My house's front door is always locked  even when I am home. My car doors are locked no matter if I'm at home or elsewhere. In my neighborhood  it's not uncommon that crooks cruise parking lots at night and help themselves to whatever they might find stashed in unlocked parked cars. They got me once when I (quite accidentally) left my car unlocked overnight. Fortunately they didn't take anything of real value  since I don't keep anything of real value in the car that they may have wanted. But it was a worthwhile reminder to always keep my car locked up.Today I keep my car secured in a garage when I'm at home  and I still lock it up when it's in there.
