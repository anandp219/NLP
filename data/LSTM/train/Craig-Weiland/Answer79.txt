Out from this case  right in front of me  the guy pulls out this sleek wedge of a computer like nothing I'd ever seen before. The screen opens on a hinge and it powers up with the startup chime from the Mac II line. I knew two things immediately: I was looking at a very rare and powerful computer  and I had to have one.Be still  my beating heart.About a year later  I was granted my wish. My parents ponied up several thousand dollars for me to buy my own computer  and I'd sold them on the advantages of a portable computer as opposed to one that was too much trouble to move from my dorm room.It was my most prized possession.
