  It is just as ethical for them to lay you off as it is for you to quit.A job is a business arrangement. You agree to provide your time  skills  labor  talent  etc. (to a certain limited extent)  and they agree to pay you money. So long as this arrangement is mutually beneficial  to both parties  it stands. When either partyyou or the companydecides they are better off changing it  then they have every right to do so.Contrary to many people's belief  companies do not exist to provide jobs. They exist to provide value to society through their products and services  and generate profit while doing so (the profit is what makes the provided value worth producing).
