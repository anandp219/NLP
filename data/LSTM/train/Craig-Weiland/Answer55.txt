I could start teasing out the invisible "rules" that guided how their logos were presented. I wanted not only to create great looking and effective designs and graphics  but I realized that I really wanted to be the guy who created those rules  too.Today I'm the art director for a $1.5b agricultural cooperative in the heartland of the US  and I'm doing everything I ever dreamed of and then some. In 2010  the cooperative rolled out its first major corporate rebranding in 30 years. I got to create the new logo and all its various permutations.
