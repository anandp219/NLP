When it breaks down  you'll be able to afford to fix it without stressing. You won't feel the sting of those insurance payments so badly  either. Knowing it's out there in your garage  waiting for you to get in and drive it  will feel good. You won't be thinking of it out there constantly sucking down your finances  and be constantly wondering why the hell you never have any money.
