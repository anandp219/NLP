  This happens in Finnish  too  but in a very restricted occasion. Singular past participle ends with -nut or -nyt  and in colloquial speech  the final t is not pronounced. However  it doesn't disappear wholly because it assimilates with the following consonant. This results in geminate consonants between the participle and the following word. If the following word begins with a vowel  the final t is represented as a geminate glottal stop.tullut juna [tul:uj:un] ('the train that has come')tullut mies [tul:um:ies] ('the man that has come')tullut pappi [tul:up:p:i] ('the priest that has come')tullut auto [tul:u:uto] ('the car that has come')This also happens with the word nyt ('now') but I can't think of any other words.
