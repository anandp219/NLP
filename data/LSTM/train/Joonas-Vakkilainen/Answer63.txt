If we look at linguistic conservatism in a historical scale  we could say that some modern language can be recognised at a farther time than some other language  because it has retained more features of the proto-language than some other language but this does not mean that this language would be older. It has just changed less. People often refer to writing systems when they speak of "old languages". In reality  the age of the writing system tells only that the nation speaking the language invented the system at certain historical period.
