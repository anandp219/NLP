The only place I've ever had to use the words mister and mrs. was in the military. However  those words are usually retained in the Finnish translation. I don't have the English originals so I can't compare  but the Finnish translation calls Mr. and Mrs. Weasley often Weasley's father and Weasley's mother (Weasleyn is  Weasleyn iti  where the name Weasley is in singular genitive  although we normally would use it in plural when talking of the parents of a group of siblings). I think that the originals use just Mr. and Mrs. in the place of most of them.
