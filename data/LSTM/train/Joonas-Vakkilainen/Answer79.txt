You need to start with repeating the sound with one word or even in isolation in order to try how it feels to you physically (and of course mentally too). If you just try to use it immediately in floating speech  you may not be able to catch the sound because then you don't have time to focus on it.It is also important to note that sounds in languages are based on opposition. A sound is meaningful because it is not another sound. If the language you are learning has more detailed oppositions than your native language  you need to check that you can distinguish the sounds from each other and to produce them distinctly yourself.
