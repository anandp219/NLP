On the other hand  I have seen in a linguistic work the term 'accent' in the meaning it is usually used in everyday English  that is 'distinct pronunciation'  meaning that the speech in question does not have other dialectical differences than pronunciation. 'Pitch' means how high the sound is. Pitch is a perceptual and subjective impression. If we look at the physical side  we speak of 'frequency'. Frequency means how many Hz the sound has  whereas pitch tells how the listener perceives it. I'm not sure whether 'volume' is used as a linguistic term.
