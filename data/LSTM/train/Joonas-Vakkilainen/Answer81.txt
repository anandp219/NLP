That's because they then have less control over their language producing. It is the same thing when you speak a foreign language in a real-life situation where you are under stress and unable to pay attention to individual sounds. For instance  I can pronounce English both with General American and Standard Southern British English accents. However  if I'm using English in a situation where there is a lot of disturbance  I easily mix those accents and perhaps get some inference from my native language.
