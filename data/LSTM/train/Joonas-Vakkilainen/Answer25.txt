  Linguistic knowledge helps you to see the rules of languages from a general perspective. You don't need to try to memorise rules that seem random when you understand the logic behind them. For example  if you are familiar with the concept of case-marking  you can easily learn how your target language functions with this feature. In Japanese  you don't need to struggle with all the particles: you can just check that Japanese has marked nominative  topic and accusative and instantly figure out how the system works.
