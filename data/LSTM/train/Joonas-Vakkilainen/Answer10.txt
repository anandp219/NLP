  I have seen it used in the description of the grade alternation in Sami languages that have three step quantity alternation. I have only a very basic understanding of the Northern Sami morphophonology  but the vowel quantity seems to be linked to the grade of the stem accompanied with a consonant change. The short vowel mark is used to indicate short diphthongs in Northern Sami. As I see it  the vowel quantity indicates the difference between the second and third grade regardless of the actual quantity of the altered consonant: for instance  when the strong grade contains an overlong consonant  the vowel is short  and when the consonant shortens to a second-grade long consonant in the weak grade  the vowel lengthens (bus'sa [puss:] : bussa [pu:s:] ('cat')).
