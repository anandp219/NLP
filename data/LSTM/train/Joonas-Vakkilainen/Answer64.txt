It doesn't mean that their language would be older than those that have been written for a shorter time. Writing doesn't prevent language from evolving either. Even though a language had been written thousands of years  it may have undergone many innovations and thus is less conservative than its relatives  which means that it may have been like a different language at the time it began to be written. This is why we cannot say that Tamil is the oldest language. It has been evolving just like other languages.
