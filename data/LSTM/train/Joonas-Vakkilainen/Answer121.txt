Because the ancient Britonic does not have that kind of position  Irish Gaelic is perceived as a mystic old language. The same can be said about Finnish  too. I presented that Finnish is quite a conservative language  and regarding those facts it can be called an "old language" (if we agree with the meaning of an "old language"). However  the same that I wrote about Latin concerns Finnish  too. "Finnish" spoken in 3000 years ago was different. It hadn't developed grade alternation yet  it hadn't probably acquired subordinate clauses or attribute agreement  which are Indo-European influence  and it had many phonemes modern Finns couldn't even easily produce.
