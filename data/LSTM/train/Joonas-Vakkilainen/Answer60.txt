However  they both work in singular: olen ampunut karhua harvoin  meaning 'I have rarely shot a bear'  where the explanation is the same as in my second example; the aspect is imperfective  mainly because of the negative "feeling" of the clause  and the specific meaning is something like 'I have some rare experiences of shooting or attempting to shoot a bear'  so I would say that the irresultativeness is not clear here. This clause is basically the same as the corresponding preterite clause in my second example.
