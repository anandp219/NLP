In this case  the speaker means that in some occasions  when the bear came to his yard  he shot at the bear; that is  the bear was shot a few times but it is still alive  or  it is dead now but it was shot a few times before and it survived those times. Another context could be: metsstin useita elimi mutta harvoin ammuin karhua  meaning 'I hunted several animals but I rarely shot a bear'. To be more specific  the aspect here is clearly imperfective  but I'm not sure if it includes the irresultative aspect as well.
