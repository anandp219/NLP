Those criteria made sure that the dialect was "pure" and free of intervening influence from other regions or language change. This is why dialectology is not interested in urban language or social factors. Modern sociolinguistics researches the things dialectology is not interested in. It is interested in differences in language that are caused by social factors  which can be regional but related to social classes  gender and rural vs. urban as well. Unlike traditional dialectology  sociolinguistics wants to look into the variation with the same dialect and the same speaker and not to see language as a stable system.
