  It is of course good to learn English at school  but it indeed is a problem that it is seen as the foreign language. Because English is seen and heard a lot in media (for example in Nordic countries  English on TV is not dubbed but subtitled) and people can manage their holiday trips abroad by using just English  they believe it is the only language that matters. That's why parents choose only English as the foreign language for their children at school  which leads to the situation where smaller schools have to stop offering other languages because of the decreased number of interested students.
