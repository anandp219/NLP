If you follow this  throws will be effortless. However  this is not always easily seen in judo because the distance between tori and uke is small. In aikido  the distance is bigger  and it is easier to perceive what a proper taisabaki looks like. Aikido is also an art of ukemi. Judokas are not used to do multifaceted ukemis. They see ukemi just as an inevitable bad thing  which must be done in order to get down safely (and competitors actually don't do ukemi  which is dangerous). Aikido gives diversity to your ukemi and helps you perform as an uke more comfortably.
