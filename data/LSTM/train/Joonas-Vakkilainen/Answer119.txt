Ferdinand de Saussure was very keen on the Lithuanian accentuation system because it would give us insight into the PIE accentuation system. The article considers Irish Gaelic an old language because it has been spoken in its current location for a long time. That is silly reasoning because many languages have been spoken a long time in their current locations. To my knowledge  Irish Gaelic has changed a lot during its history  even shifting from one typologic type to another. It doesn't have a long written history either.
