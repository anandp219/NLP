  To put it briefly  children brain has different "settings" from adults. Acquiring a native language requires a sensitive period which happens in early childhood. An infant is able to learn every possible sound used in human language but after the certain period  the sound system gets locked. Everyone learning a foreign language notices how difficult it is to hear or produce particularly the vowel system of a new language. That's just the difference between a child and an adult  and that's how humar brain works.
