The negativeness requires the word snow to be in partitive. In a positive clause it would be in plural nominative (lumet on jo viety pois = 'snows have already been taken away'). Mostly we use singular just like English when speaking of snow. For example  sataa lunta ('it snows'  lit. 'rains snow')  not sataa lumia. The plural partitive form lumia is mostly used in a proverb menneen talven lumia  meaning literally 'snows of the past winter'  which means that something belongs to the past and should not be thought of any longer.
