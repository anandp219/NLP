  'Tone' is the change in the pitch  which affects the meaning (lexically or in some other way). Tones can be level tones  i.d. they don't change in time  or contour tones  i.d. they pitch makes a figure  for instance rising  falling  falling-rising and so on. 'Accent' is perhaps a bit ambiguous. The strict meaning is 'stress' or 'prominence'. Accented syllables are made clearly distinct from the other syllables by putting more effort on them  uttering them more loudly or using a higher pitch. Accented syllables are not necessarily stressed; there are languages that don't use stress but still make some of their syllables prominent  which means accented.
