That's why I marked it with bold letters. We could even call it a case marker particle. Though  it differs from other particles in having a conjugation.Transitive verbs have direct objects that get the accusative marking:Watashi wa nihongo o hanasu.orWatashi ga nihongo o hanasu. 'I speak Japanese''I' is marked as the theme in the first sentence and as nominative in the second sentence  and 'Japanese' as the object with the case marker particles.The other kind of particles  postpositions  show what "happens" to the word:Sanji ni densha de Asahikawa kara Kyto e iku.
