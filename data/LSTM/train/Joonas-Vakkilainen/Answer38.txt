A dialogue such as Snape said that... Professor Snape  Harry...cannot happen in Finland  because people are not regularly addressed with titles outside of the military and the president's interviews  but the translation that follows the original text makes the situation culture-specific. To sum it up  I don't think that many of the honorifics are lost. Usually when English is translated into Finnish  sentences where a person is addressed with Mr.  Mrs.  doctor etc. are translated the verb being V  but in HP that has not been made.
