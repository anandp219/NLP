A language called Serbo-Croatian is not spoken of anymore  and each country maintains their own languge. When written Ukrainian was formed  Polish loanwords were favoured at the expense of Ukrainian words that had Russian cognates. Language standardisation does not mean that people should change the way they speak. Standard varieties are just forms of public  official speaking and particularly writing. This method is used in the Nordic countries. Standard Finnish and Norwegian Nynorsk are collections of several dialects and made-up rules.
