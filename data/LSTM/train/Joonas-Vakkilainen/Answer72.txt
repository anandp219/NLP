  The other answers already point out  the premise of the question is false. In addition to that  I'd like to focus on the weird question details: Turkey is not Uralic. Turkish is a Turkic language. There is an old hypothesis of the Ural-Altaic language family  which would include both Uralic and Turkic languages  but according to the available evidence  they are distinct families. Nevertheless  Most Uralic-speakers are Christians. Finnish  Estonian  Hungarian and many minority languages in Russia are Uralic and the majority of their speakers are Christian.
