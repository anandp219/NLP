It's far more important to learn from our mistakes adapt going forward. Try to get into a habit of practicing Introspection and Metacognition. Question why you make certain decisions. Did you believe a news story because it already conformed to your decision? Did you start eating pomegranates because you read many peer-reviewed journal articles that discuss the health benefits  or was it because you saw them mentioned Facebook?It is impossible to avoid making irrational  illogical decisions all the time.
