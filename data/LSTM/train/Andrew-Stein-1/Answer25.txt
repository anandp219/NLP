  Pixar movies are usually a must-see for me  and I try to go into them without reading previews  reviews  etc. Going into the movie  all I knew about Inside Out was that it appeared to have "borrowed" the main premise from the '90s sitcom  Herman's Head.Now to be fair  my impressions of the movie were probably soured somewhat by the fact that the guy behind me was snoring so loud I could hear him over the movie speakers  which themselves were cranked up to 11. That aside  I just couldn't get into it.
