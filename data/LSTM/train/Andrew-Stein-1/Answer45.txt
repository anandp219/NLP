Thats a pity  because it was both compelling and whimsical. Well  that was not us. Endframe is not us. It is  however  our tech  which Endframes founders stole in collusion with the VC firm Branscombe Ventures.This was the brain rape that made me cry out in betrayal  to someone I thought was a friend: Say it aint so  bro! It hurt as much as the loss of Campbell Scott hurt Julia Roberts in the shamefully un-sequeled Dying Young. Endframe? More like FriendShame  if you ask me!We may well initiate legal action against these pretenders to the throne of middle-out technology.
