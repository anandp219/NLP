Any Hooli employee whose contract included this clause was null and void  therefore  the language pertaining to IP developed on Hooli's equipment (along with everything else in his contract) is moot and unenforceable.It wasn't the fact that Richard hired Jared from Hooli that ended up being Belson's undoing. Belson included the non-compete violation charge to the arbitration just to be a dick. Had he not done so  the arbitrator may never have noticed this clause and would have ruled in Hooli's favor.
