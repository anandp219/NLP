  When Richard worked at Hooli  his contract contained language that any work done using Hooli equipment would therefore become Hooli's property. Therefore  once Richard used a computer at Hooli to work on his app  it became the property of Hooli.However  his contract  along with many other Hooli employees  also included a Non-compete clause that prohibited him from securing employment elsewhere. (Jared had this same clause too.) However  non-compete clauses were deemed unlawful by the state Supreme Court.
