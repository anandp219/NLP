The viewer is supposed to feel an adrenaline rush as Harry cuts through them like a ginsu through watermelon. At the end of the scene  Harry is obviously shaken and very disturbed as he was fully conscious of what he did. The Kingsman have a strict code of not taking life unless necessary and while I would never want to hang out with any of the church members socially  they didn't necessarily deserve to die either. At least  not by "movie rules" anyway. I suppose this may cause the viewer to question his/her own enjoyment of the scene and violence incurred on innocent (if not morally repugnant) victims.
