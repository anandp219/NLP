  One thing that Inside Out got VERY wrong was the depiction of memories as a sort of movie that never changes. While they do show that memories can change in regards to emotions associated with them  they leave out the concept that memories are plastic and are reconstructed every time they are remembered. The brain recontextualizes past memories with current sensations and thoughts  meaning the more you remember something  the more the memory changes. Also  for some weird reason  the movies are shown from the 3rd person perspective instead of first  but I'm guessing it is because they didn't want to re-render scenes from Rylee's perspective.
