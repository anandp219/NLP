In the end  the guys at the hospital are just another group of bad people (because of circumstances may be) who crossed paths with Rick's group and both sides witnessed a lot of bloodshed. And I also don't think that this entire hospital scene is over. I am pretty sure our group is gonna come back here in the future.But as I have said again and again  the acting of all the characters in the show is commendable. Rick  Daryl  Michonne  Carl  all of them are so deep in their characters that it almost comes naturally to them.
