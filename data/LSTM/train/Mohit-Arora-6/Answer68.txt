  Is there a way I can give it a 3.5 stars on Quora?Well  I have mixed feelings about this episode. Actually  the entire show is getting a little bit repetitive? It feels like we are not going anywhere. The group wanders  meets another group of bad guys  kill them  one of the not-so-major character of the group also get killed  the group of bad guys is not completely destroyed and the few left  retaliate  our group once again fight them and kill them all.The same thing happened in this entire season so far.
