Imagine that you know everything  you even know that the person talking to you is just lying for the most part of the conversation  you know that there are very few people on this planet with whom you can have an intelligent conversation and those people are just busy making rockets or helping the world understand the universe  or playing chess  or teaching mathematics at UCLA.Ultimately he will probably turn towards drugs or something in which he can find refuge.
