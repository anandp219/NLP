  As I have mentioned in some of my related answers on Quora  Carrie is not an emotional person overall. She was never an emotional person. Brody was the closest she came to being a sentimental person. She has little love for her sister and father. This has probably something to do with her being bipolar. Carrie is not a type of person who can handle babies. She LOVES her job. The only reason she kept the baby was that she truly loved Brody and probably wanted a part of him to be with her (even if Brody somehow made it to the US  he would have been arrested and sentenced for life).
