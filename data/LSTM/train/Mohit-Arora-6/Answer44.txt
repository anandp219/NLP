Most of the good companies (at least in IT sector) try to visit campus in the beginning of the placement season so that they can filter out the toppers and good candidates (exceptions are always there and some good candidates are definitely left out). So  chances of having a good company visit your campus at a later stage of placement season are less.Also  your surrounding is changing. All your friends are getting placed. Even that guy who used to get less marks than you is placed. The girl you used to make fun of for being dumb?
