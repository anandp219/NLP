They even had hard coded paths and passwords in their code. 4. There is no solid evidence that points towards the involvement of North Korea in the attacks. The attack was initiated from Bangkok and it was routed from China. Also  with the advancement of Internet  it is possible to mask the attack from anywhere in the world. Unless an attacker openly takes the responsibility of the attack and declares their affiliations  I doubt that FBI and NSA would be able to prove North Korea's involvement.All these points do not rule out the involvement of North Korea in the attacks but certainly bring down the likelihood of their involvement.
