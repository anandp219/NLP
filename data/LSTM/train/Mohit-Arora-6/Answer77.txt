But stipend doesn't matter much in college internships. You get to learn a lot doing such internships.You will have to contact professors directly over email and have to convince them that you are a good candidate suitable to work on their ongoing project (if any). So again  chances are very slim.What I did during my winter vacations after 3rd semester is  I joined Winter school in IIIT-Delhi. This is an amazing program that is done in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University. They select around 50 people from all over India and there were people from IIT Kanpur  IIT Delhi  IIT Bombay  IIIT Hyderabad  BITS Pilani  VIT  MIT  etc.This is a 15 day program and is divided into three tracks.
