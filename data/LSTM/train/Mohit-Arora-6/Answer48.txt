  It's one of the worst shows I have ever seen. If you have not started it yet then please don't watch it.I just finished episode 5 of season 3 and I am cursing myself that I decided to start watching this TV series. I have a thing for closures and it is really very hard for me to stop watching now. But every episode of "The Following" I watch  I feel like I am just wasting my time. Yes  it is that bad.As some people pointed out  season 1 was at least decent. They had an average plot and the acting was not all that bad.
