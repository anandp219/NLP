  Getting internships during winters is really tough in India because most engineering colleges have holidays for not more than a month during winters. So getting an internship in a firm is almost not possible because it is highly unlikely that a student can make a positive impact on the firm in just a month's time.But it is possible to get internships in prestigious Indian colleges like IIT Bombay  IIT Delhi and so on. But again  it solely depends on the need of professors. If they are working on some project and they really need some people to help them in those projects then they may provide you an internship at a very low stipend.
