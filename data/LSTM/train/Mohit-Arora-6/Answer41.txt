  I think Bob was a type of guy who never wanted trouble. He was a very calm person and during the entire movie he never lost his cool. Even while putting a bullet in Deed's head  he showed just a little signs of anxiety. During the robbery  he didn't try to stop the robbers  didn't panic or provide any kind of hindrance (Marv's reasons of not showing any resistance were understandable as he was in on it).I believe he would have given Deeds the money  had he came to his house earlier that morning.
