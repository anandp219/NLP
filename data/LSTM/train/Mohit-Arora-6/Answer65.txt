While watching this serial you will feel like you are experiencing all that drama in real time.4. Sherlock - It is difficult to not like this show. So much nerdiness and such great acting by Benedict Cumberbatch. 5. Modern Family - And just to add a pinch of humor in all this drama. This is one original show with genuine jokes. And the best thing about this show is that it let the audience decide whether they want to laugh at a certain joke or not. There are no irritating background laughing sounds that play with each and every stupid punch line.
