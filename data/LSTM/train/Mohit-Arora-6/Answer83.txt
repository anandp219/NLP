  I think the reason is pretty straight forward. Nacho is the brightest of them all and he saw an opportunity when Jimmy mentioned kettlemans and their 1.6 million dollars. As Nacho revealed later in the episode  "he wanted to rip them (kettlemans) off" and for that he wanted Jimmy's help.Nacho knew that Mijo was a thick headed person and he was ready to kill Jimmy just out of anger because Jimmy helped those two knuckleheads who called his grandma a biznatch. He knew that killing or hurting Jimmy would not help anyone in any way.
