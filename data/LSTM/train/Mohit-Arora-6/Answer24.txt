So people usually do not interrupt them by asking intelligent questions.Another irritating thing about IIIT is the labs. Neither the teacher nor the TAs know anything about any of the practicals you are supposed to do. But they still won't allow you to do something else even if it is related to academics. You have to sit for 3 long hours doing nothing. Labs are a complete waste of time in IIIT-A.Post 6:00 P.M - Evenings are usually fun in IIIT-A. Some people play cricket or football in the ground.
