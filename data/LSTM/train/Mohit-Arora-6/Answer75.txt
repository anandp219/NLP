  Strictly speaking  you are not eligible to appear in the interviews for the companies which have 60% eligibility criteria throughout the academics. But as others mentioned in their answers  a lot of companies won't sweat too much about it because B.Tech and BSc are equivalent degrees and B.Tech will be given more preference.In any case  do not hide the fact that you have done BSc and mention it in your resume. It won't give you any advantage whatsoever but  as you mentioned  there would be no way to explain the 4 years gap to recruiters.Talk to your campus placement committee and ask them to mention your case as a special case to the recruiters and ask them if you are eligible to appear for the interviews.
