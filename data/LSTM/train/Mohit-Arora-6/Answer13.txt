  I am not sure. I would say it's a 50-50 chance. There are a few things that do not resonate with the fact that the North Korean government could have been involved in this hack - 1. The only thing that links North Korea with this cyberattack is the movie "The Interview". But if you look at the original hack then there was no mention of the movie. The hackers didn't say anything about it in the statement they issued to Sony pictures. Nor was it mentioned in the message that appeared on the employees' hacked computer screens.
