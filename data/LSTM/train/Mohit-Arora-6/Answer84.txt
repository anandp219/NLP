  In our college project we used the HMM (Hidden Markov Model) algorithm to train a model to detect credit card frauds.The model is first trained with a certain number of past transactions by the customer and the probability of that observation sequence is calculated by using HMM. When the user makes a new transaction  that transaction is added to the previous observation sequence and the probability of the new observation sequence is calculated. If the difference between the two probabilities is less than the threshold value then that transaction is accepted as a genuine transaction else it is tagged as fraudulent transaction and the customer is notified about it.But there were a lot of loopholes in this approach and we had to make a lot of assumptions.
