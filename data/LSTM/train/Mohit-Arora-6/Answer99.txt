  My reasons are almost same as Virali's. I am very picky about the blogs that I follow on Quora. I follow the popular and interesting ones but I almost never follow new blogs (I know this can be argued as not providing enough opportunities to new writers for them to prove their worth  but I compensate for that by upvoting a lot of "unseen" content. )The reason I do not follow any blogs immediately are -1. Their notifications hinder the visibility of notifications for answers on questions I follow.
