MySpace was pretty confident about their security mechanisms until a single person brought down their entire network and gave birth to a new type of attack which got his name  Samy. Apple is one of the leading IT firms  and even they couldn't protect their users' data.It's not like the laws against piracy are lenient  it's just that in most cases it is almost impossible to track the hacker. Even in Sony's case  both FBI and NSA are just speculating that the attack originated from North Korea. It's almost a month and they do not have any solid evidence about who did it.
