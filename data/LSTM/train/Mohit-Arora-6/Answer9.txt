  I am pretty sure Saul is missing all the CIA action. There has been a lot of hints in the show that point to this fact.1. When Dar Adal and Saul had a conversation in the restaurant in season 3 finale  Dar was pretty convinced that Saul will come back to CIA in a heartbeat if Lockhart comes begging to him. And Dar knows Saul better than most of the people in the show (I think even better than Carrie).2. When Carrie asked for Saul's services to strengthen the security in American embassy in Pakistan  he didn't even think twice before making a decision.
