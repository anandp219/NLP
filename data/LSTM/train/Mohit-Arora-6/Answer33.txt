  It differs from platform to platform and even on a certain platform there are a certain areas where you can find well mannered  sensible people and there are areas where you can find rude and arrogant *dudes*.For example  on Facebook there is a page named "Humans of New York" (a nice page  you should like it if you haven't already). A guy takes pictures of people from New York and ask them to tell him something about their life. Something small or big  that is significant to them and they have probably not shared it with a lot of people.
