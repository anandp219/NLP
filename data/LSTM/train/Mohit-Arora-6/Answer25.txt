Some go to volunteer for Prayaas. Some people just walk on the road in front of the boys hostels or sit on the divider with friends and talk for hours. Couples go to civil lines or roam around the campus until they find a silent corner where they can talk God knows what. People who are irritated by messy mess food turn their heads towards cafeteria. And the people who love to study grab their books and laptop and head towards the lab where they irritate and annoy the shit out of couples who are trying to gossip/fight sitting in the corner of the lab hiding behind their books.Nights are usually spent in the rooms playing games on LAN or sending stupid messages and bhajans on IP messenger.
