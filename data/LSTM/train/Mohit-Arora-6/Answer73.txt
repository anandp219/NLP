So  it has to be an insider's job. But Chovka couldn't take the risk of prosecuting Marv because he was his trusted companion for 10 years. So  Chovka played a little and decided to set Marv's bar as a drop bar for super bowl night when the cash was supposed to flow like water. And Marv was stupid enough to try to rob it once again.That's the reason why no questions were asked when Bob and Marv returned the money to Chovka.Could Marv have planted the bag himself? Possibly  but I think the chances of Marv doing this are slim.First  why would he cut the arm of the robber and plant it in his own bar?
