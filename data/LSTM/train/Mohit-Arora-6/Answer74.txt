I mean  it does not send any message to anyone. If he wanted to convey that nobody can screw with him then he should have sent that hand to Chechen mobsters to let them know that he took care of the people who robbed him.Also  why spoil the money with all the blood when he knew that he will have to deliver the money to Chovka anyway and will have to clean it up?Another thing  his reactions when Bob asked him to look into the bag was of disgust and fear. It looks like he didn't know what was in the bag and he didn't even want to know.
