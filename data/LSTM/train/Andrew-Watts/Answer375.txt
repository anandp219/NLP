This concept of grouping his orchestra into 'choirs' of woodwind  brass  strings and percussion implies that each section will have its own unique functionality; and will accordingly give rise to music in which opposing groups are able to work antiphonally  as separate entities  with or against each other. This "stratification" described in the Irvine excerpt relates to a technique of orchestration coined by theorist Edward T. Cone with regards to the music of Igor Stravinsky. Stratification means a sudden change in the music that makes the piece of music change dramatically  often incorporating a division of layers as the music progresses.
