However  what is underplayed is the influence of the Anglican choral tradition. Though his later works reference a certain non-specific spirituality  Harvey spent many of his most formative years studying music at St. Johns College  University of Cambridge. The choir at St. Johns is among the most famous in England and has sung daily services in the College Chapel since the 1670s. Even if Harvey did not frequently attend chapel  it would be extremely unlikely that he would have been able to avoid its influence.
