Though I am sure there are still many significant composers today who are concerned with utilizing clarity of form  their aesthetic choices are far less referential to classical genres. As a contrast  the most notable neo-classical composers made direct reference to 17th-18th century forms and figures. For instance  Sergei Prokofiev's Symphony No. 1 in D major (Op. 25) "Classical Symphony" of 1917 is written in loose imitation of the style of Haydn (and to a lesser extent  Mozart). Igor Stravinsky's ballet Pulcinella of 1920  typically regarded as the textbook example of neo-classicism  is a commentary on the commedia dell'arte libretto and music composed by Giovanni Pergolesi.
