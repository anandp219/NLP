In Tony Bannachs paper An Extended Analysis of Krzysztof Pendereckis Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima the author notes that [with] music like 12 tone or serial music  no new changes were necessary to the establishment of the score  but when we see the rise of the Cageian indeterminate aesthetics  this became an interesting dilemma.

Beyond notation  the influence of Cage on Threnody is apparent in its original title 837  likely a reference to Cages 433.
