(Page)John Harbison (1938- )  The works from his earliest period show the dual influences of serialism and Stravinskian neo-classicism. (St George)Henryk Grecki (1933-2010)  He revealed the extremes of his musical temperament in the savaged neo-classicism of the Sonata for Two Violins (1957)  which contains potent dynamic and rhythmic contrasts as well as displaying a taste for the grotesque that would resurface over 30 years later. (Thomas)Martin Boykan (1931- )  Boykan's mature style is atonal and reflects the influences of Webern and the late music of Stravinsky  the respective subjects of his two most important articles (Neoclassicism and the late Stravinsky  PNM  i/2  1963  p.155  and The Webern Concerto Revisited  Proceedings of the American Society of University Composers  iii  1970  p.74).
