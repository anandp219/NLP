Borio writes that meeting Maderna in 1946 was musically critical for Nono  as they formed a small community in Venice who  through the examination of the contrapuntal  harmonic and formal foundations of European art music  aimed to develop a new musical language. Maderna's criticisms of integral serialism may have led to Nono's new approach to pitch (campi sonori) in Canti di vita e d'amore. Maderna saw composers relying on serial techniques to establish a divide between their music and pre-WWII classical traditions.
