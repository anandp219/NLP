In the article Text-Sound Art: A Survey  author Richard Kostelanetz highlights the similarities between Ursonate and Arnold Schoenberg's use of Sprechgesang  stating that both may have been influenced by German cabaret singing  and Chinese and Korean opera. In these styles  as Kostelanetz puts it  the singing voice touches a note but does not sustain the pitch in the course of enunciating the word. In practice  this technique minimizes the importance of musical tone (and  thus  of melody) and  by contrast  emphasizes the word.The era from the late nineteen-teens through the early nineteen-thirties was quite a fertile time for text-sound works  with practitioners taking cues from the development of abstraction  or non-representational art.
