I wanted to compose such a symphony: a symphony in the classical style  reads like an early confession of neo-classicism. Stravinskys Pulcinella  the key neo-classical work  was not begun until two years later. Prokofiev was certainly referring back to classical models here  for instance in the proportions of the symphony  the well balanced sonata movements in the opening allegro and the finale  the triad-based melodies and the occasional Alberti bass figures. However  the stylization also includes Baroque elements  particularly in the third movement  a gavotte  and in the regular accompanying chords of its predecessor.
