As more advanced hardware and software became available the requirements to stage a performance of Voyager were naturally influenced by these new breakthroughs. Lewis has this timeline of technological progress on the Voyager project--The first complete versions of Voyager for the more powerful Atari ST series of computers  were finished in 1987 in New York City  as usual under extreme budgetary constraints. This version was written in Mach 2 Forth-83. Both of these early versions used a simple realtime scheduler of my own design.
