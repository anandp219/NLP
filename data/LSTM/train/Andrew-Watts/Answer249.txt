Is Reich  in essence  making Hamm's recorded speech less poignant  more clinical? It could be understood that Hamm's recorded statement  though highly charged with emotion  can only be taken literally  as it entails a first person account of an event. By excerpting the text down to a fragment  Reich is inviting a multitude of interpretations. Listeners can take in the music of Come Out as just that  Absolute Music consisting of harmonic  melodic  and polyrhythmic combinations of a found sound. By using the impersonal technique of phasing  the moment-to-moment relationships resulting here are mostly unforeseen even by the composer.
