The Prolation mass consists entirely of mensuration canons  or prolations  which employ a single melody to be imitated by one or more voices after a duration of time. In Ockeghems original mass only two voices are notated and the other two voices must be derived from the notated. When the two notated voices perform with the other two derived voices  a double prolation canon ensues. Ockeghem places the upper pair of original and derived voices in the prolatio major while the lower voices in prolatio minor and one voice in each of the pair sings in perfect time while the other sings in imperfect time.
