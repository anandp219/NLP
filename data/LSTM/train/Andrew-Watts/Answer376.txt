This is heard most decisively in the first movement Sul Ponte di Hiroshima with Nono drawing on the instrumental choirs within the full orchestra to signal shifts  often linked to changes in tempo.Canti di vita e d'amore also signals an important major departure from the typical serial techniques for Nono. In the article Luigi Nono's Canti di vita e d'amore: Musical Dialectics and the Opposition of the Present and Future author Bruce Durazzi cites a verbal note from Nono stating that this work would no longer use complete serial series  but instead would be composed of campi sonori (sounding fields) or fascie sonori (sounding bands) built upon collections of a few basic intervals.
