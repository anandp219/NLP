Are these utterances changing or is my perception of them changing?All of the other aforementioned analyzed works deal with the loss of intelligibility  but as an arrival point along a continuum. They all begin with clarity of meaning and perhaps even intent. The loss of intelligibility and proportional increase in text ambiguity is at the core of each composition's musical development. For I am sitting in a room the spoken prose is entirely unaffected during the first iteration  as it is simply a performer speaking (usually predetermined text meant for clear comprehension) in an ordinary resonant space.
