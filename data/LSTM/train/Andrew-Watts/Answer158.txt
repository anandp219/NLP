Regarding tonal harmonies  Lansky has said in a number of interviews that Idle Chatter was his first tonal composition. The traditional harmonies here function to curate the listener's focus over the duration of the work. This curation  moving from one aspect to another  contributes greatly to a sense of development. Lansky emphasizes this in the interview with Joshua Cody (Computer Music Journal  Spring 1996):I wanted to simplify certain aspects of the sound to allow myself to concentrate upon certain other aspects.
