He was (and still is) a consumer of the written word.The preferred "literature" of my childhood was always about sports cars and rock music. One book  Guitar World Presents the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time!  sticks out in particular. The sections ranking the guitar players was fine  but what kept me up at night was the list of guitar solos. I took this as scripture. It never phased me that the list was simply the result of a reader's poll.
