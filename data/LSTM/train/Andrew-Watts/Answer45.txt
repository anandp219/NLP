  I mostly agree with Curtis Lindsay's list  and I would like to further emphasize that Milhaud wrote a lot of music. Today however  his music is not performed very much when compared to other figures of his era (at least in the United States). During my undergraduate I took a number of classes with John Heiss  who studied with Milhaud over the summers at Aspen as a young composer. Intrigued by Heiss' anecdotes  I checked out a bunch of recordings of Milhaud's works. To be honest  much of the music I found to be quite bland.
