Nono's writing in Canti di vita e d'amore is often arguably more subtle  and perhaps even more complex. The clusters are compartmentalized in these 'waves'  usually isolated to given instrumental choirs. Thus  while these clusters are entering and exiting the textures  other elements are sometimes also active and following different compositional techniques. Though Xenakis  Ligeti  and Penderecki show more total line independence in their respective works due to the greater number of players partaking in any given cluster  all of their massive divisi function as a unified composite  with all of the forces contributing to create the same sound.
