In Nono's defense  though composed later  Canti di vita e d'amore shows evidence of the chosen text being integral to the understanding of the work. On the other hand  Penderecki had already completed and premiered Threnody  originally called 8'37" (at times also 8'26") as perhaps a nod to John Cage's 4'33"  before deciding to dedicate the work to the victims of Hiroshima. It is likely that because Nono and Penderecki's compositions are so close in date  Nono had already selected his text and begun the piece before Penderecki changed his work's title.Regarding text  though not technically a musical influence  the choice of text has shaped the composition and subsequent understanding of Canti di vita e d'amore.
