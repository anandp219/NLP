  The voice in Steve Reich's early tape work Come out (1966) was Donald Hamm  one of the six boys arrested in the 1964 Harlem riots. Reich composed the piece as part of a Town Hall benefit to gain a retrial for those boys involved. The composer had come across a recording of Hamm describing his attempts to get medical attention after being beaten by the police. In the article Listening Subjects: Semiotics  Psychoanalysis  and the Music of John Adams and Steve Reich author David Schwarz details the audio of the youth trying to squeeze his wounds to show blood.
