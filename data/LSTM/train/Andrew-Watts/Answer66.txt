  This is certainly dependent on how "intense" is defined when applied to listening. When I think of intense listening experiences they usually contain a lot of: timbral saturation  abrupt interjections  harmonic complexity  and a shockingly visceral affectation. Oftentimes  this is only an excerpt from a work  though may be the most memorable part. Similarly  for me  it is hard for any other era to compete with the 20th-21st centuries when it comes to raw "intense" sonorities. Of course there are emotional  heart-wrenching moments in works throughout hundreds of years constituting the Classical canon.
