  Helmut Lachenmann's most well known teacher was Luigi Nono  who he first met in 1957 at the Darmstadt Ferienkurse fr Neue Musik. From 1958 to 1960 he studied with Nono in Venice. At the 2015 highSCORE Festival in Pavia (Italy) Lachenmann was the guest composer and during his lecture he described the influence Nono exerted during this formative period. According to Lachenmann  each lesson he would bring in drafts of what he was working on  and each time Nono would exclaim in frustration that it was too melodic.
