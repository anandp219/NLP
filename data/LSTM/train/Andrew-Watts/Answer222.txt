  The underlying implication within the question  that Chopin and Mozart are similar composers for the piano  makes their combined characteristics difficult to find in any one modern composer. This is not a slight against contemporary composers who write for the piano. Rather  as I mentioned in a previous question (Who are composers similar in style to Frdric Chopin and Claude Debussy? )  these example figures do not strike me to have much in common. Mozart was a central figure of the Classical Era and lived from 1756-1791.
