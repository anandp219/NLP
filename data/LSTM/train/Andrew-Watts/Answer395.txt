The work is notorious for its miasmic opening  with layered polyrhythms prophetic of 1960s Ligetian micropolyphony  and for a passage of manic 13-part free-association counterpoint as anarchic as anything in Schnittke. (Fanning)Clytus Gottwald (1925- )  Ligeti's pools of sound  for example  influenced Gottwald's transcription of Soupir by Maurice Ravel  and Ligeti's micropolyphony is the primary feature of the transcription of Berg's Die Nachtigall. (Bloesch) Friedrich Cerha (1926- )  [Baal is] a slick 1920s foxtrot rubs shoulder with micropolyphony and aleatoric procedures  and there is even an allusion to Messiaen's ornithological music.
