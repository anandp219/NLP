Tu returns to the full forces of the first movement. Durazzi explains the evolution of campi sonori in this last movement:The campi sonori are developed using essentially the same techniques as in the first movement  but the roles of the orchestral instruments are substantially different. Except for a few notes in measures 182-84  the strings never play in the traditional modes of arco or pizzicato  but instead produce percussive effects (strings tapped by the fingers or col legno battuto in various positions along the fingerboard).
