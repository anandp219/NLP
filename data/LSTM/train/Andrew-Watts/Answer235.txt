I appreciated the analytical and critical aspects of pinning these texts against each other. Also during this time I dove into Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow trans.) and John Henry Newman's The Idea of a University. Soon after  my focus firmly settled on composition  and because I felt my peers already had such a strong background in classical music (many had attended high school programs like Juilliard Pre-College and the New England Conservatory Prep School)  I immersed myself in the subject.Memoirs from major contemporary composers like Gunther Schuller's The Compleat Conductor and John Adams' Hallelujah Junction: Composing an American Life both helped inform what the history of my profession was like in America.
