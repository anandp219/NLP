I call it micropolyphony (such a beautiful word!). (Bernard)Around the same time period other composers were experimenting with dense textures resulting from many independent instrumental or vocal lines. These included  most notably  Krzysztof Penderecki (ex. Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima) and Iannis Xenakis (ex. Pithoprakta). What separated Ligeti and his micropolyphony technique from his contemporaries was the means of achieving the pitch clusters. Penderecki produces his extensive elaborations on tone clusters by aleatoric means  often involving a multitude of glissandi effects with indeterminate repetitions of attacks and entrances.
