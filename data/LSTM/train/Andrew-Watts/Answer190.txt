I look over where I left off in the piece  consult my pages of pre-compositional planning  and begin to generate material for the next part. Also  depending on the circumstance  around this time I occasionally will turn the wifi off of my laptop. The many e-mail pings and other notifications will become a major distraction. 04:00PM I shift my operation over to the surface of the bed at this point  as sitting all day has made me uncomfortable. I spread all my pages out in front of me so that I can refer to any concept with just a quick glance up.
