The boy soprano heard on the recording was Harveys son Dominic who  according to author Mario Sibilia in his article Analysis and Listening Score of Mortuos plango  Vivos voco  was a chorister at Winchester Cathedral from 1975 to 1980 (the year Harvey received this commission by the Centre George Pompidou in Paris). The intangible connection a father has with the sound of his son is so personal that it had to have influenced him regarding how the vocal line was then treated. Furthermore  there is a strangely ironic aspect to what Harvey must have experienced; listening to words lamenting the dead coming from his still very much alive son  only to then gradually pull at the musical nature of the sons song through electronic manipulations until it has lost its human characteristics  effectively becoming dead.Scholars often go into great detail unpacking the electronic means undertaken by Harvey to create Mortuos plango  and rightly so given its place as a pioneering work of computer music.
