  [Image via MERZsonata] Kurt Schwitters' Ursonate exists as one most important early text performances works. Written between 1922 and 1932 in Hannover  Germany  Schwitters' efforts may be viewed as coming out of the Dadaist movement. Jaap Blonk  a frequent performer of Ursonate  notes in the September catalog for the exhibition Kurt Schwitters in Norway that Schwitters was refused by the Berlin Dadaists. Following this he started a one-man Dada group in Hannover called Merz. Then in 1919  after gaining a national reputation with the absurd love poem An Anna Blume  he made contact with fellow Dadaists such as Hans Arp and Raoul Hausmann.
