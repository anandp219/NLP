Brewed only once a year on December 6. Samichlaus is aged for 10 months before bottling. This beer is perhaps the rarest in the world. Samichlaus may be aged for many years to come. Older vintages become more complex with a creamy warming finish. Serve with hardy robust dishes and desserts  particulary with chocolates  or as an after dinner drink by itself. Brewed under the exclusive licence of Feldschlsschen-Hrlimann-Holding  Switzerland. *Alternate: Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock - Privatbrauerei Franz Inselkammer KG / Brauerei AyingSaison / Farmhouse Ale Saison Dupont - Brasserie Dupont sprl (Belgium) Image via Les Coureurs des Boires: mai 2012 A slightly cloudy yellow-colored ale with high carbonation  fruity and spicy aromas and tastes  and perceptible  somewhat quinine-like bitterness.
