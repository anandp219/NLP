Iannis Xenakis would fall into this category.As for acclaimed composers and instrumentalists who  as far as I can tell  had no dedicated musical study until age 18+ here is one example--Aram Khachaturian (1903  1978)Born and raised in Tbilisi  the multicultural capital of Georgia  Khachaturian moved to Moscow in 1921 following the Sovietization of the Caucasus. Without prior music training  he enrolled in the Gnessin Musical Institute  subsequently studying at the Moscow Conservatory in the class of Nikolai Myaskovsky  among others.
