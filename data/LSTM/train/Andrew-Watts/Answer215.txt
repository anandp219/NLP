From measure 8 to measure 24  the trichord is always present regardless of other activity. In the essay Unlocking the Mystery in Ligeti's Lux Aeterna author Jeremiah Selvey notes the various transpositions of the {0 2 5} chord or Ligeti chord as a key feature in understanding the structure. The temporal component of micropolyphony  as seen in the opening  is achieved through a massive polyrhythmic canon. Here each voice is assigned a rhythmic denominator as to deny unison attacks between parts. For instance  the basic building block of soprano 1 is tuplet 16th notes  soprano 2 is quintuplet 16th notes  soprano 3 is straight-16th notes  and so on.
