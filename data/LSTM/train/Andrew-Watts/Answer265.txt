In Missa Prolationum the interval of imitation increases throughout the mass from the unison up to the octave  using all of the traditionally imperfect intervals as well. This intricate mass is one of Ockeghems most intricate pieces and in turn one of the most complex Renaissance compositions. Beside the intricate prolation canon  the actual structure of the mass references divine mathematics.
