Though the contribution of the rest of the band musically was quite sparse during this Star Spangled Banner performance at Woodstock  without their presence to fulfill the model expected of the situation the audience would have likely felt abandoned by such unorthodox  ungrounded sounds from the soloist. Secondly  the relationship the soloist has with the composition is also unique among the three works here. At its origin  the Star Spangled Banner is not a contemporary piece  in fact it is far from it.
