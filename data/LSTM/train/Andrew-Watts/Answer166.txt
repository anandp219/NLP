Regarding Idle Chatter  Lansky stated in the Jeffrey Perry / Perspectives of New Music conversation that the bulk of the detail work is done with a kind of algorithmic composition. I don't actually decide what notes goes where  I use a random probability method that scatters them with a fair degree of consistency. That works pretty well  I do it a lot. Introducing a random scatter of attacks further disrupts any effort to understand the voice as communication. Language is not random  and due to the highly structured and predictable nature of language one may impose such expectations on the voice in Idle Chatter.
