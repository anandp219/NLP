The parameters of extemporaneousness include dynamics  octave  individual tempo  and repetition to say within 2-3 modules of the group. However  a number of these parameters are limited naturally due to each instrument's capabilities. The indeterminate parameters are plentiful. The composer relinquishes the above listing (dynamics  tempo  instrumentation  duration  repetition); yet retains pitch  order of events  and rhythms. What separates In C from the other works is the sense of group improvisation towards a common goal.
