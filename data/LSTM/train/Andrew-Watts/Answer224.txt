Chopin  though no slouch in output  composed far less and across substantially fewer genres. All his known works involve the piano  and only a few range beyond solo piano music  as either piano concertos  songs or chamber music.Chopin  during the last 18 years of his life  he gave only some 30 public performances  preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. Mozart was far less reclusive with regards to public performance and was known to play piano (and occasionally violin/viola) in a number of concerti  solo recital  and chamber music contexts.
