Through the use of these differing localized polyrhythms Ligeti is able to ensure this sound mass effect. No unifying meter is palpable  nor is any individual's contrapuntal motion susceptible to isolated listening during the tutti sections. Though often compared to the great polyphonic works of the Renaissance  the rigorous application of pre-compositional rules is perceived by listeners in a fundamentally different way. The melodic lines governed by strict procedures in Ockeghem  Palestrina  and the like are done so in order to arrive at an optimal texture where all voices may be aurally identified by their role.
