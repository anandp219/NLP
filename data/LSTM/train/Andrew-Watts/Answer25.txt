Lewis has stated that the Voyager project was started during 1985-86  while he was composer-in-residence at the Studio voor Elektro-Instrumentale Muziekin Amsterdam. The staff of STEIM at the time included Michel Waisvisz  Nico Bes  Gabrie Lantinga  and Misha Mengelberg. It is unclear how much interaction Lewis had with these individuals on a creative basis  though it is plausible that certain aspects of the program could have been due to their influence. Early versions ofVoyager were originally developed for and programmed on the Yamaha CX-5 computer by Lewis  using a special version of FIG-Forth developed for that underpowered machine by STEIMs technical director  Joel Ryan.
