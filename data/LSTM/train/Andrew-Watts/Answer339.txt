Thomas continues by saying that "though Penderecki never fully engaged with orthodox serial techniques " he did "absorb certain permutational procedures and explore textural writing" which leads to the full blown sonorisms of subsequent scores. Emanations (1958)  with its two string orchestras tuned a semitone apart  paved the way for Threnody  which uses quartertone clusters. Within the canonic sections of Threnody Wallin notes the symmetrical organization of materials to be Webernian in principle as well.The influence of Stravinskian and Webernian choralism is further contextualized in Bannachs analysis  whereby he describes the division of the string orchestra up into different choirs in Threnody: Each choirs differential in range is about a third to a tritone from top voice of the choir to the bottom voice.
