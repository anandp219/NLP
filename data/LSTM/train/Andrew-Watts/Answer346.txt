The music of Anton Webern  along with the other Second Viennese School composers (primarily Arnold Schoenberg)  Igor Stravinsky  Bela Bartok  and Olivier Messiaen has been of particular interest to Nono since at least his years at the Venice Conservatory. Belonging to the previous generation of Italian composers  Luigi Dallapiccola and his music influenced Nono from the mid-1940s onward. Beyond dodecaphonic canons  Nono utilizes some of Dallapiccola's musical symbolism. For instance  author Bruce Durazzi in the article Musical Dialectics and the Opposition of Present and Future points out that the fratello motive from Dallapiccolas opera Il prigioniero (194448) signifies hope that conditions might improve.
