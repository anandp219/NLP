In the artistic communities of the AACM and AEC where designing new objects of interaction (what they termed "little instruments") from bicycle horns  bells  birthday party noisemakers  wind chimes  and a vast array of percussion instruments (such as found objects) was ubiquitous  it then comes as little surprise that Lewis took such ingenuity to the next logical step with Voyager through the use of computers. Not only can this environment of instrument building be seen as an influence  but even the technology itself plays an important role in the development of Voyager.
