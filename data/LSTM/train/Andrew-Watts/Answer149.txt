First  the speech is never fully intelligible. One instantly recognizes it as sounds from a human's voice  even more specifically an adult woman's voice. However  due to the constant fragmentation of words  the syntactic meaning is obscured. As the playback continues and many of the samples become familiar  albeit retaining their functionality as novel utterances. It is this false familiarity that causes listeners to question what exactly they are hearing: Was that bear or there? I was certain the last time it was said the sounds was closer to bear  but now I am not so sure.
