Lastly  the sheer rate and relentlessness of the sample repetition causes a loss of meaning in the text. To hear the same phrase again and again  unaltered (only rhythmically offset)  forces a different kind of listening and is often compared to a trance or meditation. The essence of the phrase is retained as a long form focal point and the details  the meaning and syntactical content in this case  are slowly and progressively disregarded perceptually despite their omnipresence in the texture. How then does Lansky achieve development in Idle Chatter when syntactic ambiguity is unwavering?
