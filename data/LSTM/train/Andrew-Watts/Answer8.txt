Without this distinctive attack it is unclear from the onset whether what is being played is the bell  a sine tone  or even the entrance of the boy's voice. The fake bell in its isolated form still sounds fake  though this judgment is at the threshold of differentiability. As there are less physical characteristics to cue the listener (no breath or text)  and the same generation of overtones from the original sound source is exercised  the final verdict for discerning the bell is a I know it when I hear it situation.
