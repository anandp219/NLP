Penderecki deconstructs what is required to create sound masses. The differentiation between these compositional methodologies is therefore beyond labels and the aesthetics of notation  it is a matter of decision making. For Xenakis sound-clouds and Ligetis micropolyphony the composer carefully instructs each performer on the changing musical parameters at any given time. For Pendereckis sound masses the composer provides a loose shape and the performers make their own decisions (to an extent) to achieve the shape.This transfer of creative decision-making from the composer to performer shows the influence of John Cage.
