   Alvin Lucier was a founding member of the Sonic Arts Union (1966-1976) with Robert Ashley  David Behrman  and Gordon Mumma. The element uniting the works by these individual composers  according to David Behrman  was the desire to create pieces "in which established techniques were thrown away and the nature of sound was dealt with from scratch" (Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition  266). Therefore  it is likely that during this decade of working and performing together  the members of the Sonic Arts Union influenced each other.
