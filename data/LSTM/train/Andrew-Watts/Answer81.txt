[Image via Kinetype Ursonate]For Kurt Schwitters' monumental work Ursonate (1922-1932) an added level of complexity is brought to any analysis due to the many versions of the 'poem score' that exist  as well as the many equally valid performed interpretations. Schwitters created the first line in Ursonate from the opening of a poster poem by fellow Dadaist Raoul Hausmann  then expanded it and developed different notations to represent this line. Schwitters repeated the process of reordering novel yet convincing groups of syllables for subsequent lines  maintaining the poster poem score aesthetic.
