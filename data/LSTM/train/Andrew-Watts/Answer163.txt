The large-scale pitch structure is mapped from the Winchester tenor bell overtones. Thus  a vertical harmony becomes a horizontal melodic line. Similarly  the lowest eight harmonics present in this pure bell instance are used as pitch centers for the eight sections constituting the work. Each of these harmonics relate not only to the pitch material  but also to the duration of each section (i.e. the higher the partial  the shorter the duration and vice versa). In recapping  the proportions  harmonies  and fully fleshed-out melodies (excluding the subsequent melodic fragmentation) are all taken from the source sounds of the tenor bell and (to a lesser extent) the chorister recording.
