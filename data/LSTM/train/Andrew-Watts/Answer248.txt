I have no such ambiguity about [using] the voice.It is curious that Reich uses the term ambiguity to describe his hesitation  or more succinctly  the lack of hesitation to work with the human voice. Ambiguity becomes a mode of expressiveness with Come Out  but also among other tape and electronic music works with speech/language elements. With such a strong political implication at first  the repetition of phrase progressively degrades its meaning  becoming ambiguous and obscured. David Schwartz writes of this in the article Semiotics  Psychoanalysis  and the Music of John Adams and Steve Reich  saying that Come Out [uses] repetition obsessively to strip meaning just as it is about to take shape.
