It seems as if everything Nono does in his creative life takes Venice  and particularly the Giudecca  his home  as the chief poetic point of departure []Instruments are laid out on the score in groups of twelve which obviously facilitates Nono's desire to position all twelve tones  and their twelve intervening microtones  in some form of stratification across the instrumental sections. This concept of grouping his orchestra into 'choirs' of woodwind  brass  strings and percussion implies that each section will have its own unique functionality; and will accordingly give rise to music in which opposing groups are able to work antiphonally  as separate entities  with or against each other.Borio notes that in conjunction with the contrapuntal techniques of the Franco-Flemish School  which Nono had studied throughout his life  lies the influence of the dodecaphonic canons of Anton Webern and Luigi Dallapiccola.
