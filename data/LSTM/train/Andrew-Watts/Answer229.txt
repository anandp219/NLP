  YouthGrowing up my younger brother was clearly the bookworm of the family. We would come back from the public library and he would have a stack of fresh literary sustenance several feet high. I did not understand why he spent all day reading book after book; there were times I remember exclaiming-- "He reads stuff he doesn't even like!" This was not an exaggeration; often within the first few pages it was clear if the novel matched his preferences  but if it failed he would continue to power through.
