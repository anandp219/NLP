A Sony lavalier microphone was used to capture the sound of the instruments. An IVL model 4000 Pitchrider was used to convert this audio to a form that the software could process. The instruments played by the software was an Emu Proteus/2 sample player and synthesizer. The software has 12 instrumental channels at its disposal at any one time. Any one of the 45 Proteus instruments (timbres) that I chose for the recording can be selected by any instrumental channel.Lastly  other likely influences during the composition of Voyager include pianist Cecil Taylor and composer/saxophonist John Zorn.
