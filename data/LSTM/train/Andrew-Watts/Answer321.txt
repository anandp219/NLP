Not only is the recording of this bell tolling a primary sound source throughout the work but it also provides the text for the title and lyrics. The inscription on the bells exterior reads: Horas Avolantes Numero  Mortuos Plango: Vivos ad Preces Voco [I count the fleeting hours  I lament the dead: the living I call to prayer].
