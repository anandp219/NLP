Or rather  he should abandon melodic lines altogether. For Nono the use  or even reference to melody was too strong an association with those in power during WWII  the "ruling class" who used music within the classical tradition as propaganda. Nono was an adamant supporter and member of the Italian Communist Part since 1952  and viewed any such obvious link to this tradition as a political statement. Thus  the passages that Lachenmann brought in were labelled "bourgeoisie" by Nono.Lachenmann claims that despite his best efforts to eliminate any clear melodies  when he would bring in the revisions Nono would still point out specific measures and  infuriated  repeat that it was bourgeoisie.
