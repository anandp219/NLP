If one could play in any style to try and elicit a like response from the program  why is the avant garde jazz approach de facto in performances of Voyager? A musician could just as well freely improvise within a hard rock  blues  bluegrass  folk  etc. idiom and still work within the intended construct of Voyager. It is the decades of shared influence among the members of the AACM  who do maintain particular aesthetic leaning on their chosen instruments  that has  intentionally or not  established a precedent for how Voyager should sound.
