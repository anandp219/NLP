The impact of this technique (polyphonic writing applied to a vast number of individual instruments or voices) in modern music is substantial. Works drawing upon similar means after 1960 are immediately thought as Ligetian in nature regardless of the influence. Works of earlier eras are even now being contextualized as proto-Ligetian micropolyphony. Sound mass is a more vague term  as it describes the resulting texture and not the specific technique required to produce it. Therefore  sound mass is not tied to any one composer the same way that micropolyphony is.
