Accordingly  the piece begins with a taped voice saying I had to like open the bruise up and let some of the bruise blood come out to show them (0:00-0:005). After a two-second silence (0:05-0:07)  the passage is repeated (0:07-0:12); after another two second silence (0:12-0:14)  the passage is repeated again (0:14-0:19). For the rest of the piece  the listener moves into the spoken voice  through the repetition and phase manipulation of shorter and shorter phrases and words from the text with which the piece began: come out to show them  to show them  come out.
