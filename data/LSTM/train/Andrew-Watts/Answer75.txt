Though formally trained in the fine arts  Schwitters seems to have been influenced by literature and poetry throughout his life. Blonk points out that opening line to Ursonate (Fumms b w t z Uu  pgiff  kwii Ee) was taken from the two Plakatgedichte (Poster Poems) by Hausmann. Blonk also claims that Schwitters used phrases such as this to provoke audiences at literary salons  who expected traditional romantic poetry  by endlessly repeating them in many different voices. This German salon atmosphere relates to other potential influences  such as Sprechgesang.
