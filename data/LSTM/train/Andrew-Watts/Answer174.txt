Schaeffers approach made the sound itself the point of departure by choosing real sounds  existing in the world  collecting  classifying and recording them and thus making them objets musicaux. From the core properties of concrete sounds  he would then build structures into a work  thus reversing the traditional process of composition.It was Lachenmann's desire to move this abstraction of real world sounds from recordings to live performance. He believed that this could only be accomplished through utilizing sounds  as Mosch puts it  "unused and hence uncontaminated in the past."
