Brandon LaBelle outlines the process in his book Background Noise: Perspectives on Sound Art:By replaying the recording of his voice back into a room  rerecording and playing back  repeating the process  the work develops into an accentuation of acoustic space whereby the sound source (voice) loses its original shape through larger conversational interaction in which the voice makes apparent the surrounding architecture through its disembodied reproduction. Over the course of the work's process  the original recording dissolves into a long  moving tone  punctuated  as Lucier points out  by rhythm alone  for we can still make out the general impression of the original spoken text: its inflected edges  the moments of pause  and Lucier's stutter.
