Vedova  an artist by trade  shared similar political leanings with Nono and they both collaborated on many occasions. According to Irvine  Omaggio a Emilio Vedova contains striking similarities in gesture to the first movement of Canti di vita e d'amore; indeed the first 20 seconds of the Omaggio seem like a study for the opening 20 seconds of the Canti. It is then not out of the question that  because the opening musical material of both works dealt with the same concepts  Nono (perhaps even unconsciously) was influenced by his memories and experiences with Vedova while writing Canti.
