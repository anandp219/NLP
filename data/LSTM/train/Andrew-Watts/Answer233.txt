During English classes I thought  if this is what novels are all about maybe reading is something I don't care for. This all changed my senior year in high school through British Literature. Every book required for that class I enjoyed. Themes of humanism and the chasing of intellectual pursuits were common among the works. The settings were frequently urban. I was hooked. From this year George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four  Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus  Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales  and William Shakespeare's Macbeth all left a strong impression on me.
