Schoenberg  whose daughter Nono in fact married  also influenced Nonos decision to compose with activist themes at the core of his musical message. For instance  according to Durazzi  Nono's first publicly performed work was the Variazioni canoniche sulla serie dellop. 41 di Arnold Schnberg (1949)  which refers to Schoenbergs Ode to Napoleon (widely understood as an anti-fascist work). Canti di vita e d'amore takes this social activism message and focuses on the threat posed by nuclear weapons.The relationship with the music of Stravinsky is notable through the shared use of what theorist Edward T. Cone calls stratification.
