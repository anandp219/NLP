One could even compare the sections of heightened ambiguity of comprehending what the exact text is (come out to show them) with parts of Idle Chatter where the text is creating equally ambiguous novel words existing in the margins of intelligibility (there vs. bear). Another quality differentiating Come Out from the other works is the lack of acoustic (timbral) transformation in the voice even during sections of great syntactic ambiguity. Since there is no electronic processing of any kind and the development is achieved by means of phasing duplicate copies of the vocal sample  the ambiguity arises out of the inevitable overlapping of different rhythms set to different words.
