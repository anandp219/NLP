  At institutions with the most funding the average matriculation age is usually around 29 years old. The ages when entering such a program frequently span from 25 to 35  with those outside of this range in either direction extremely rare. I know this might come as a shock to many in the STEM fields where typical incoming Ph.D. students are fresh out of undergrad. However  for small programs like Stanford and Harvard the intake is only 2-3 new doctoral composers per year. With such a limited number of spots  competitive applications must demonstrate substantial training in the field and high promise of attainment as composers.
