It was also during this year that I realized my preference for absurdest humor. I read a lot by and about Douglas Adams  as well as the history of Monty Python. Furthermore  around the same period I was studying for the SAT's I remember connecting with A. J. Jacobs' memoir The Know-It-All.College (undergrad and master's years) My freshmen year in college I had enrolled in two comparative literature courses. The topics seemed to be based around various novels from across the world (all translated to English).
