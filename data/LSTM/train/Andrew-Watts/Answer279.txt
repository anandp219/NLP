(Fulias)Paul Hindemith (1895-1963)  In the same year he wrote the piano suite 1922  fashionably including shimmy and ragtime movements  and Kammermusik no. 1 for small orchestra  which marked a turning towards neo-classicism. (Griffiths)Sergey Prokofiev (1891-1953)  Prokofiev showed quite another side of himself in the Classical Symphony op.25 (191617). His much-quoted remark  I thought that if Haydn were alive today he would compose just as he did before  but at the same time would include something new in his manner of composition.
