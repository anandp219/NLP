Mason contextualizes Limited Approximations as  in part  a homage to Wyschnegradsky and mentions Haas' use of Wyschnegradskys method of modulation in quarter-tone pitch space and his idiosyncratic use of a chord of stacked fourths and tritones. Returning to the quotations via Universal Edition  Haas also cites the specific influence of Wyschnegradsky on Limited Approximations: At the end  a quotation from Ivan Vishnegradskys harmonies (against the relics of an overtone chord in the strings)  not with the clarity of his composition arc-en-ciel (I was able to premire this work for 6 pianos tuned in twelfth-tone intervals in 1988) but in the clouding over of twelfth-tone chords gliding gently towards the heavens.
