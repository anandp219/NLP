In the article Too Many Notes: Computers  Complexity and Culture in Voyager  Lewis describes the roles of the composer and improviser throughout the work.Voyager (the program) analyzes aspects of an improviser's performance in real time  using that analysis to guide an automatic composing program that generates complex responses to the musicians playing. This implies a certain independence of action  and indeed  the program exhibits generative behavior independent of the human performer. The system is not an instrument  and therefore cannot be controlled by the performer.If you want to hear the program play in a certain way  you figure out how what you want to hear is organized  and you start playing that way yourself.
