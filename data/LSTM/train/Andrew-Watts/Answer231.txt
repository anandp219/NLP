This was a challenge. From the ages of 14-17 I had this text in tow whenever I traveled  reading and re-reading every detail about these guitar solos. Not only did I have the list memorized in order  but I sought out recordings and sheet music for each of these songs  learning how to play a large portion of the solos and riffs myself. Exposing myself to a variety of sub-genres and eras via this publication proved to be formative in my background as a creative person.As evidenced above  I have always had the makings of a specialist.
