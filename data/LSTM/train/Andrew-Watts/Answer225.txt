Given their different music eras it would make sense that each composer had different identifying features in their piano music. Mozart epitomizes clarity of line and form. Chopin  often in an effort to gain greater expressiveness  blurred elements of traditional forms (ex. Fantaisie Impromptu Op 66). Mozart used ornamentation and virtuosic flairs in his piano writing  but again  stuck within the accepted practice of his time. Chopin utilized ornamentation heavily  often embellishing simple melodies on the piano with extensive chromatic grace note passages.
