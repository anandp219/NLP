There is no fixed rule as to the number of repetitions a pattern may have  however  since performances normally average between 45 minutes and an hour and a half  it can be assumed that one would repeat each pattern somewhere between 45 seconds and a minute and 1/2 or longer.It is very important that performers listen very carefully to one another and this means to occasionally drop out and listen. As an ensemble  it is desirable to vary dynamics as well as create group crescendos and diminuendos.Each pattern can be played in unison or canonically in any alignment with itself or its neighboring patterns.
