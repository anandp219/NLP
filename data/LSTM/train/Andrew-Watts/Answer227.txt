David Rakowski. He is most well-known for his set of 100 high-energy piano tudes  which are regularly performed worldwide. He is currently at work on a parallel set of 100 piano prludes  of which 46 have been written.It is often hard to tell if a living composer's works will enter into the repertoire. With that being said  here are a few contemporary pieces that seem to be quite popular with performers recently: Philip Glass - Metamorphosis (1989)  John Adams - Phrygian Gates and China Gates (1977)  Steve Reich - Piano Phase (1967)  and Helmut Lachenmann - Guero (1970).In recent decades the composer-soloist has become increasingly rare  as the dedication required to be competitive as a professional composer and a concert pianist is substantial (and often with little overlap).
