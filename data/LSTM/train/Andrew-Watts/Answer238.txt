In particular  Metzer's book was pivotal in my understanding and contextualization of artistic expression in today's world. Today I am starting to be in the odd  yet fortuitous position where I know either the subject or the author (or both) that I happen to be reading. I had the great privilege of studying with Aaron Einbond  and recently he  along with Aaron Cassidy  published Noise in and as Music. I view this book as the next step after Metzer's work on modernism. Einbond notes that-- Its contributors are first and foremost practitioners  which inevitably turns attention toward how and why noise is made and its potential role in listening and perceiving.Lastly  about a year ago I was completing an artist residency at the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts (VCCA).
