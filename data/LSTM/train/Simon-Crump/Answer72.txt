  Where I live in the north west of England we are supplied with three different bins by the local council for putting our waste into. There is a weekly collection service.The grey bin is for clean recyclables. Into this we put newspapers and magazines  plus plastic packaging  empty cans  jars and bottles. Anything which contained wet goods like fruit juice or sauces should be cleaned first.The green bin is for garden waste like grass cuttings and leaves. However  uncooked vegetable waste like potato peelings can also go in here.The black bin is for all non-recyclable waste so this is where leftover food scraps and and other waste like crisp packets go.
