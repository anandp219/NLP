It is not enough to have a generous welfare state  such as exists across most of northern Europe  if the majority of production rests in private hands. The relationship between socialism and common ownership has been well established through time  not least in the British Labour Party's Clause IV  which was finally removed from the party's constitution at Tony Blair's behest in 1995. An economic system which combines mostly privately-owned means of production with some state-owned production or significant economic intervention is described as a mixed economy  and a political system in which an elected government promotes a mixed economy incorporating a generous welfare state is best described as social democracy.
