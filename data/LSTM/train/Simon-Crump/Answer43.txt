Historically this has typically resulted in authoritarian  one-party states in which democracy and free speech were suppressed  and production itself became inefficient and misdirected. Collectivization of agriculture at a national level has a particularly bad track record  too often resulting in famine and starvation. And crucially  the final stage of the transition from socialism to true communism has never occurred in practice  meaning that communism remains a utopian ideal rather than an achievable outcome.The broad consensus of democratic political systems has therefore been to deliver social democracies based on capitalism  featuring state intervention to redistribute wealth where necessary.
