  I have never met an Edwina in person either  but in Britain the name will always be associated with former Tory MP and Junior Health Minister  Edwina Currie. Edwina Currie was a household name in the 1980s  happy to attract attention to herself and well-known for being outspoken and at times politically incorrect. She was forced out of her health ministry job after announcing that most UK egg production was infected with salmonella (a claim which later turned out to be true) and had a four-year affair with the future Prime Minister John Major.
