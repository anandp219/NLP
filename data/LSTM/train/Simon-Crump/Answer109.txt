As soon as this became clear  Corbyn would announce capital controls due to the "exceptional circumstances".Rupert points out in his answer that capital controls are illegal under EU law. However  there will be a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU before the next general election and the "no" vote is looking alarmingly strong. It is possible that the UK could already be on its way out of the EU before Corbyn could take office.An EU exit is currently opposed by the majority of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) and Corbyn says he will not campaign for an exit because he respects that opinion [1].
