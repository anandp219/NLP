This waste can be messy so we use sturdy black plastic bin-liners in the bin we have inside  and then transfer the waste in the tied-up bag to the outside bins when it is full. The bin-liners we use are of the 40-litre variety.Other councils have a different recycling system and some of them have more bins so that the initial sorting can be done by the residents themselves. For instance  they might have separate bins for paper and plastics.
