They are not looking for a confrontation  they just want to steal some stuff that they can sell and be on their way. Most often  if a burglar does accidentally enter your home while you are in and you announce your presence by switching a light on or making a noise  they'll be running away sharpish.The exception to this is if you have been specifically targeted because the criminal knows you and wants to exact some revenge or retribution. If you're not mixed up with criminal gangs this is very unlikely to happen to you.
