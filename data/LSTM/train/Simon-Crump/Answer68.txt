  I don't have much of a problem with Facebook optimizing their position within the law. I'm more concerned that what this situation seems to indicate is that our tax code isn't really fit for purpose.Global internet companies like Facebook do pose something of a challenge for legislators. It shouldn't be too difficult to work out how much revenue they've generated from UK advertisers but clearly most of the costs are in the US; most of their employees are there and most of their servers are there.
