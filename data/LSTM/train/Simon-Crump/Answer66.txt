  EDIT: the question has now been modified so much that this answer is meaningless. See question edits for context.Like everyone else in the UK  the Queen is entitled to have all her essential healthcare needs met by the National Health Service at the taxpayers expense.In practice  though  the Royal Family generally pay for their own health care for reasons of privacy. However  there have been occasions when they have used NHS facilities  such as the time Prince Charles broke his arm while playing polo and was treated at NHS hospitals in Cirencester and Nottingham.
