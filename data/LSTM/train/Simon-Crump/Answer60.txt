The last school shooting in Britain was in 1996  following which handguns were outlawed. No child has been shot dead at school since and for the most part parents feel safe dropping their kids off in the morning. That's what liberty feels like  and the price of it is that ordinary citizens don't get to walk around with a gun.You see  the freedom to own and carry a gun could be considered one form of liberty  but freedom from the fear of all the other nutjobs who are carrying them is another. You can't have both.
