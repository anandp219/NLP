She was notorious enough to have her own puppet on the satirical TV show  Spitting Image  and established her own media career after losing her parliamentary seat in 1997. Given the sample size of one  the name Edwina for me evokes a strong and rambunctious woman who you wouldn't want to mess with. I neither like nor dislike it especially.
