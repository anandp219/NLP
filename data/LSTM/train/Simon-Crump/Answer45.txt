  There's a very broad generalisation which says that snowboarders suffer more minor injuries but skiers' injuries are often more serious. Snowboarders fall over frequently  especially beginners  but they are at less risk of lower body injuries because everything is fixed in place. Consequently  snowboarders tend to fracture wrists  ribs and collar bones. In contrast  skiers are at risk of twisting their knees  which can easily result in a painful injury followed by surgery  months of rehabilitation and a joint which never fully recovers.
