Most train journeys from Innsbruck to Venice require a change in Verona and this is probably the cheapest way to go as tickets start at 39. There is one direct train daily which gets you there in around four and half hours. You will experience much the same scenery as driving but you obviously won't be able to stop and look around:Timetable Munich-Innsbruck-ItalyFlying isn't a great option because there isn't a direct flight  so at best it's going to take you two and half hours via Vienna. Innsbruck airport is certainly interesting though  situated as it is in a steep-sided mountain valley.
