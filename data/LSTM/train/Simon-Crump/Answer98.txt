You could get unlucky and be the random victim of some psychopath who wants to break into a stranger's house and do unspeakable things to them  but if you are actively planning for such an event you probably watch too many horror movies. Furthermore  it's unlikely that anyone willing to invade your home while you are in it is going to warn you in advance or knock politely before storming in  so you're going to need to sit with a loaded gun within easy reach every minute of every day for it to do you any good.
