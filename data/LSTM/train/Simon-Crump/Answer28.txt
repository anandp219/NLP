When refugees are trying to smuggle themselves into the UK from Calais  residents of the south of England are likely to say "they're quite safe in France  why don't they just stay there". Similarly  European leaders point to the fact that the refugees arrive via Turkey and argue that they can't claim asylum in their country if they have already made it to safety in Turkey.It's a region-wide problem but there isn't a region-wide authority capable of dealing with it. The EU lacks the sovereignty required to force member states to accept refugee quotas and any attempt it makes to do so may backfire and strengthen opposition to the EU from within.
