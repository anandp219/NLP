  It would almost certainly result in a reduction in tax revenues  as well as a shift of the tax burden from the richest in society to the average earner. I present two pieces of evidence to support this.Firstly  the socialist French president Franois Hollande introduced a 75% top rate of income tax shortly after being elected in 2012. Individual income tax revenues fell by 4.9bn in the year following introduction of the new tax rate  contributing to a total revenue of only 16bn in contrast to the French government's prediction of 30bn.
