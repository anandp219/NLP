The important difference is that in Britain policing occurs by consent  not by force. That's liberty right there.Now as it happens  a policeman was killed on Merseyside yesterday  5th October 2015. That area includes Liverpool  one of Britain's largest cities and not known for its conformity or allegiance to the government in Westminster  yet David Phillips was the first police officer in 34 years to be murdered while on duty there. And he wasn't shot  he was run over by someone in a stolen car.
