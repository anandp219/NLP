Like his mentor Tony Benn before him  Corbyn sees the EU as a capitalist stitch-up  guaranteeing freedom of movement for capital and thereby limiting the ability of individual member state governments to control it. His problem is that the majority of the Parliamentary Labour Party support Britain's membership of the EU  and he would need to conduct something of a purge before he could get the party to adopt a pro-exit policy.Beyond the EU issue  it's difficult to see any ideological common ground.
