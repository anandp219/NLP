  I vaguely knew of him through his association with Jackass. As such my opinion of him was much the same as the rest of the Jackass team  i.e. a somewhat amusing and rather reckless man-child who was prepared to hurt himself for our entertainment.Then he appeared on the Channel 4 show  The Jump  which is how he came to be acquainted with Stacey Solomon. The Jump is a strange show in which a number of celebrities are taught a variety of winter sports and compete against each other. It's not highly rated but I watched it because I'm a keen winter sports enthusiast myself and I'm familiar with the shooting locations.
