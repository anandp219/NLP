If there is a government which levies taxes in order to provide a public service  that is evidence of socialism in action. The government builds roads and organises a water supply? Socialism. Schools for the poor and social security payments for the unemployed. All socialism!Such a broad definition of socialism is nonsense. To be meaningful  any definition of socialism must address ownership of the means of production in order to contrast it with capitalism. Socialism promotes common ownership of the means of production  either by the state or perhaps by decentralised workers councils  as opposed to private ownership as in capitalism.
