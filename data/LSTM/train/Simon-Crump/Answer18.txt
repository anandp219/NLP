Who do you fancy in the struggle to get to her handgun; fifty-year-old Mrs Miggins who teaches history or a seventeen-year-old boy who has watched a few survivalist videos on YouTube and has the element of surprise? By the time Mr Hardman the football coach has stormed the classroom with his Uzi  the kid has wiped out half his classmates already. Seen from the other side of the Atlantic  anyone who believes that teachers need guns is living in some kind of dystopian horror movie.Finally  I don't think there are any more mentally unstable people per capita in the US than there are anywhere else.
