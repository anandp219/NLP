There is also an additional element of National Insurance which is paid by the employer and which the employee never sees in their payslip.If you are living and working in the UK  you are obliged to pay the relevant taxes. Historically there were loopholes which allowed self-employed people to operate through a limited company and avoid National Insurance but these have been all but closed by the government via legislation known as IR35.Note that around half of British people also contribute to private pension schemes  either independently or through their employer.
