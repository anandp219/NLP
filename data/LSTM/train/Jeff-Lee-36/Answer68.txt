  Does calling life unfair do anything for you? The question of life's fairness need not be asked unless you perceive some benefit in blaming something external for whatever it is you find underachieving or incomplete in your life. I would think it more valuable to simply do the best you can in all circumstances and stop comparing yourself to others. Life is life. It is what it is. It is neither good nor bad  and despite what people want to believe  it cannot be made to have attributes of equality of being.
