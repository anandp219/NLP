  The definition of the change in Retained Earnings is Net Income/Loss.In double entry bookkeeping  there are basically five kinds of accounts  three types on the balance sheet  Assets  Liabilities  Equity  and the two types of accounts that get closed out to Retained Earnings each year  Revenues and Expenses. So  for the accounts to add to zero  i.e.  for the balance sheet to balance (Assets equals Liabilities plus Equity)  and given that Retained Earnings is an Equity Account  the sum total of all revenues and expenses will always be equal to the net change in Retained Earnings.
