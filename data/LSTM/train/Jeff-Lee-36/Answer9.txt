  Best scene? It was far too memorable to narrow down to less than seven scenes for me:Frankly  Scarlet  I don't give a damn.Lawzy  we got to have a doctor. I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies.I'm very drunk and I intend on getting still drunker before this evening's over.No  I don't think I will kiss you  although you need kissing  badly. That's what's wrong with you. You should be kissed and often  and by someone who knows how.Fiddle-dee-dee! War  war  war; this war talk's spoiling all the fun at every party this spring.
