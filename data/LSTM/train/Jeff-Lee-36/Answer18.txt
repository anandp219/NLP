I know you probably feel victimized  and that is to be expected but  lining up supporters against her is not going to help. You have the unfortunate burden of being born into this family and you will have to stay there until you are 18. You need to make the best of the situation by learning to cope with her problems  by becoming the adult in the relationship. Try to show compassion despite being mistreated  I know it is not easy. Good luck.
