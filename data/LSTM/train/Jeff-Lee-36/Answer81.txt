What I am saying is that school type learning has an end to usefulness. The important stuff cannot be learned from a book  a guru  a list of aphorisms. It is a process that begins  in fact  with unlearning. As I said most people go through life not having seriously asked the question you pose  and most certainly avoided seriously looking for answers. The reason is that we are complex beings who are capable of much self deception. The most important part of us is hidden by a lie  it is the ego that we grew to trust as our savior from feeling wrong or threatened.
