  Do you really have to be better than someone? Even better than anyone? I think such concepts are very detrimental to humans and the absolute opposite of what religions should be teaching. Only the ego needs to categorize and demonize people. And the ego should be the one thing that all religions should teach that we abandon. There was a master teacher of the East that did this and another master teacher that tried to teach this to the Middle Eastern and Western world  via forgiveness of our enemies and loving all our neighbors.
