  Absolutely. Only a mentally dysfunctional person is capable of committing unloving or harmful acts to their offspring. But  I would carry it a step further. Wanting to hurt anyone is a sign of a mental problem. It doesn't matter if they are of the opposite political party  a different religion  a gang wearing different colors  or whether they have  in fact  actually harmed you  your reputation  your bank balance  and whether that harm was accidental or deliberate. It is all a matter of degree on a continuum.
