  Sorting  and searching  for logging the mail and maintaining the phone directory.Logging the mailBeginning in the early 1900s  an office typically had a receptionist that was underutilized and needed several limited functions that could be fit into the job as time permitted  and since they typically received mail deliveries  sorting the mail was a common task. In order to accommodate the internal control objectives of having independent persons log the mail and open the mail  and because there was a need to document the date received  and to limit the number of people handling the receipt of checks  logging the mail and checks was a very common best practice.
