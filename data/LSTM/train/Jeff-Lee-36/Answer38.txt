  It depends on the religion. Some are worse than others  but in all cases it results from good intentions but a warped understanding of God and his relationship with his offspring. Those of Abrahamic faiths have this (mistaken) notion that their Creator would condemn his Created for capricious reasons  therefore  everyone needs to be "saved" by playing the magical games that assure their getting a pass. It is sad that they believe this  sadder that they miss the greater truths of their own religions that encourage them to love their fellow man rather than judge them  forgive their neighbors rather than see them as condemned  and saddest yet  that they don't realize that it is offensive to be treated this way.
