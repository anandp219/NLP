If you accept that the existence of conciousness is not solely an emergent property of the brain  we refer to that as spiritual mind. This spiritual self  if it exists  and if it is not emergent from the brain  it would carry properties we normally associate with the mind  as it is totally abstract  not needing the physical for its existence  but only for its expression  and would pre-exist the brain  in time. There is a subschool of Advaita Vedanta that would say that there is a Mind or Spirit created long prior to birth  (even billions of years ago).
