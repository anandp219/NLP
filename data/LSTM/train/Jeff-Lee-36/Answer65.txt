  I don't think people really inspire you. What often suffices for the appearance of inspiration is someone likes how they feel around a particular person and they conflate the person's behavior and how they feel  correlation versus causation  and they emulate that person. In the process of emulating their behavior  they change their own opinion of themselves  and are satisfied that they are happier and equate it with having been inspired. But  wasn't it the fact that they changed their opinion of them self that was the key  and can't that be done even without a role model or a mentor  if you choose to live your higher values?
