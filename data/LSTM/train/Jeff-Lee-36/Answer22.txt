That also implies you could fall closer to the "norms" for being classified as being labeled with a disorder  but we should be careful not to make too much of the label  and think more about the person that we are labeling. My friend has success in helping his patients because he does not always see them as being hopeless  as "being their label." In fact  one could say that a patient (and healer) are healed  only after the therapists has momentarily forgotten to judge the client. In the case of this particular trait  the steps one should take in becoming more empathetic  it is probably different for all  as we each suffer from a myriad of different fears that make us what we are  but whatever "heals" a person toward growth as a self actualized person  and becoming more focused on service to others  forgiveness  love  and nonjudgment  will reduce the focus and strength of unhealthy ego based thinking  and vice versa.
