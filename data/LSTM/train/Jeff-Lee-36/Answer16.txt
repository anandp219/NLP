Regardless of whatever metaphysical underpinnings fit your paradigm of reality  we could say that this Spirit  for the exact same reasons that Freud identified as occurring in the developing human  would also have a Spiritual ego  and that it went through processes of unnatural beliefs and fears  traumas  dissociation  and reactions to its maker  forming unexamined conclusions  selective awareness  a not clear knowing of true self  etc.
