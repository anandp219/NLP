  Like Les  I don't find much value in that particular formula  although I suppose it could benefit some people. Most short cuts to actual thinking through and understanding the theory behind something  lose its value once the second person tells the third person  (without the 40 page explanations as to why  how  exceptions  nuances  etc. )  and the rule becomes misunderstood dogma  and then the fourth person and the fifth person poke holes in it  because they don't have an honest clue as to what the original meaning was.
