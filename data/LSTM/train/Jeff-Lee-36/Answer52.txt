If you are sincere in your quest as a truth seeker  realizing that your friends are usually right  and that on this subject you might be wrong  then begin with the idea of discovering why you feel the way you do. Did your father  or a teacher or minister convince you that homosexuals were sinners  or pedaphiles  or into S&M or were out to convert others? If so  you are now an adult and know that none of those things are true  and should have no problem transforming earlier errors in thinking. Did a homosexual ever approach you and make you feel uncomfortable and you responded in anger?
