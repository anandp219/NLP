  I have several friends who are practicing therapists. One is constantly reminding me  whenever I ask him a question in which I have labeled the person with a psychological disorder  if that "type" of person exhibits x traits because of y or z  that we are are all on a spectrum for each disorder that exists. Most of us are at the far extremes (normal or labeled with the DSM V label)  and that to some extent  we all share attributes of these disorders  but to such a small extent to be insignificant.
