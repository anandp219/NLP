  Interesting that you have the awareness to realize that there is something amiss rather than let your ego tell you that because you were old before your time  that you are more mature than others. I knew a girl who joined a meet up group of adult children of alcoholic parents. In her case  it backfired because she didn't really heal  she became a bigger victim  using the label as an excuse for everything  self-permission not to grow. I am inclined to say  professional therapy. It may not take a lot of time or money; group therapy may even work well for you  in that what you are needing to do  is learn techniques of observation that allow confidence to grow organically.
