  I usually do not answer questions that call for a list  because inevitably I leave out people who should be on the list  and I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. I've been a longtime Quora user and have come across a lot of amazing contributors. My list will include newer  highly-active Quorans  as well as users who are no longer as active  but are worth subscribing to for their past contributions alone.Unlike many "famous" Quora users  Adrin Lamo is both prolific and proficient. And by proficient  I mean he writes beautifully about a host of topics.
