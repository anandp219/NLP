Your clients may leave for other companies  and if they like you  they might hire you again and cut out the agency middleman. This has happened to me several times  and connections are very important in ensuring a steady-ish stream of work.2. Check out Craigslist. Seriously  this is where I've found a lot of my clients. Look under "writing jobs" and "marketing/ad jobs " not necessarily "gigs" (but you should look at that  too). Often  companies will be looking to hire a copywriter  but if you apply  you can often start out as a freelancer (they will often want to"try before they buy" by giving you a project or two).
