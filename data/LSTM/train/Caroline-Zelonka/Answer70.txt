  A2A. It couldn't hurt. Ok  the shot itself might hurt a bit  but if you are worried about it -- and if you haven't had a tetanus shot in the past 10 years -- I would get one for peace of mind's sake.Googling it  WebMD states that tetanus is usually transmitted through deep punctures  not scrapes  though it is possible to contract it from a scrape. I'd recently got a tetanus booster  even though I did not ask for it  because it was a new combination vaccine called TDap  which protects against whooping cough.
