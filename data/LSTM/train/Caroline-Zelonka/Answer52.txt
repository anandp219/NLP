)I would say now that companionship and intimacy are pretty much the only things I want. I am also interested in keeping my assets intact; that is another reason why an older educated woman might be hesitant to tie the knot. But I think maybe I want to try marriage  and it definitely would be fun to incorporate it into the big 5-0 celebration. Or not. I honestly don't really care either way  and if I die an unmarried woman  so be it.
