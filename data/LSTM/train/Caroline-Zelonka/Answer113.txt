  "From the mindset that brought you the Axe body spray commercials.." At its heart  it seems juvenile and pathetic. The kind of thing only a certain type of young  sexually-frustrated man would take seriously.Sure  it's peppered with a lot of disrespectful language and stupid jokes that might get a person riled up. The female dating pool  for example  is described as "poon" which I think is a slur on female anatomy. It also spends a lot of time pushing forward the notion that "alpha males" somehow have it better when it comes to  um  poon.
