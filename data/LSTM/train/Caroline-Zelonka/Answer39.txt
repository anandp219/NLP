Well  my features kind of disappear  especially when I am tan (I have light eyes and olive skin)  and I personally think I look weird  though my mom and sisters also have extremely sparse eyebrows. Repercussions  other than looking a bit weird? I don't think there are any. I mean  everyone has something about their appearance that's a little odd  whether it be an oddly proportioned facial feature  overly thick eyebrows  flaring nostrils and the like. I personally don't know anyone who waxes their brows and draws them back on  but I imagine they either like the look or don't want to bother with shaping and plucking.
