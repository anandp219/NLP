  There's a dehydrated human on display in Seattle's Ye Old Curiousity Shop. His name is Sylvester  and this is what he looks like.His real name has been lost to history. The body was found in 1865  by some cowboys in Arizona's Gila Bend Desert  and brought to the Shop in the 1950s. It was thought to be a case of natural dehydration  but in 2005  the body underwent CAT scans that revealed that Sylvester had also been pumped full of arsenic -- an early embalming fluid -- shortly after his death.How does he feel?
