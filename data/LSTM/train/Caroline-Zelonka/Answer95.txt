  Great question! If you have never tried marijuana before  I would strongly encourage you to set aside your fears about smoking  because smokable marijuana (the plant buds) produces the shortest-acting  most predictable high.If you have the money  I would recommend you purchase a vaporizer concentrate with a low THC/low cannabinoid level. Your budtender -- the person selling marijuana at the store -- will be able to advise you on products suitable for a first-time user. The vaporizer is much less harsh on your throat because it produces less smoke; similar to a tobacco vaporizer compared to a regular cigarette.
