  A2A. I am old enough to remember the era of the comb-over  and believe me  there were a lot worse looks than Donald's Trump's. A large percentage of my male teachers -- in their 30s and 40s -- sported these awful hairstyles where the hair on the side of the head would be grown long  then placed over the top like a strip of bacon. Combovers could look semi-presentable in a controlled environment  and by controlled  I mean an indoor situation where the head doesn't need to move around much. The moment a man bent over  turned his neck  or heck  subject his hair to outdoor conditions  it would fall apart.My generation was the first to embrace the shaved head look  and man  what a difference.
