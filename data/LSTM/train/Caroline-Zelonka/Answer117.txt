But I beat myself up for losing the iPhone. "You don't deserve to have nice things" etc. etc. But this was a bit triggering for me  because when I was young  if I lost something it was hardly ever replaced. (I had to go through winter without a proper coat once. )So I began to consider replacing it  but only under extraordinary circumstances. I said to myself  "it's only $850." There were four days in the month  so I told myself that if I could earn an extra $850 in that time  I would buy the phone.Less than 5 minutes after making that agreement with myself  I got an email out of the blue.
