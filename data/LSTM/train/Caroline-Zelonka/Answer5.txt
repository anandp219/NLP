  In my experience  it's fairly hard to tone the inner thighs enough to see some "tone " so if you are really worried about it  I'd suggest you wear a skirt or pants (with Spanx pantyhose underneath) to this event if you are self-conscious about how your inner thighs look.You could try doing some isometric exercises at your desk. Get a small (10" to 12") exercise ball or some other similar-size object and place inside your knees. Squeeze hard for a count of ten  then release and repeat. If you can work to fatigue  you are working your muscle.
