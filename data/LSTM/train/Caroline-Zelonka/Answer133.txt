Shit!! I flagged down a flight attendant and asked if I was on the wrong plane  and indeed I was. Good thing the Portland flight hadn't taken off yet. The crew called the other plane  and someone was sent to board the Medford-bound plane  check my boarding pass and I.D.  then escort me to the Portland-bound plane. It felt a lot like getting on the wrong bus. I didn't have bags  just a briefcase (it was a day trip for work)  so it wasn't a big hassle  and Alaska as a company is always very gracious about these things.
