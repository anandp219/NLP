(When you hire high school students as salespeople  you can bet there's a script  and most telesales scripts are pretty shitty.) Sometimes  sure  I got some sales. Because in both of these cases  the product and offer were actually pretty great. However  I only made commission if I made a sale (or if the investor agreed to a follow-up phone call from a broker). So it soon became clear to me that I needed to hunt in greener pastures  as it were.So I turned to the phone book  for lookalike prospects.
