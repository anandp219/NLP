Sign on with a temp agency. In my market  we have Creative Circle  Filter and a few others which represent creative talent to clients and companies. They will talk to you  review your portfolio and resume  and try to hook you up with gigs which can range from single projects to short-term on-site gigs.The pay can be pretty bad  since the agencies tend to take a huge cut for themselves. But not McDonald's bad; you can probably expect to make at least $30/hr if you are a junior (3-5 years' experience)  and up to $75/hr as a senior (10+ years experience plus a portfolio with some impressive stuff).But  this can be a reliable source of income  and depending on how much you are willing to settle (in terms of hourly rate and desirability of the assignments)  you can reasonably expect work to come in via the temp agency route during the first month.Plus  you'll get a chance to prove yourself.
