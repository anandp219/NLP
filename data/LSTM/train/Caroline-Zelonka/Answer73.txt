  I felt like killing the Crown Prince. Upending an apple cart. Taking a nosedive from my broker's high-rise office into the streets of Manhattan  littered with worthless Quora credit certificates soaked in Top Writer tears. I went home and hugged my children. Ok  so they were just houseplants but they are the closest thing I have. I called in sick to work and binge-watched nine seasons of Friends while drinking cheap wine straight from the box. I checked and rechecked my Credits balance  hoping that the millions would magically reappear.
