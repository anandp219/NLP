It was a former colleague from San Francisco  where I had lived about 10 years previous. He had an emergency  needed a brochure written and called me because I was the only writer he knew who had experience writing in that particular topic (obstructive sleep apnea). "How much are you willing to pay?" I asked.He asked how much I would charge. It was a quickie project  not a ton of work but it had to be turned around quickly. I said "I'll do it for $850  but I need to be paid right away. "I explained the deal I'd made with myself  and we laughed.
