  Mine was a financial coincidence. I had just gotten my first-ever iPhone  and had taken it on vacation to Mexico. Well  I lost it. First time I'd ever lost a phone  and it was a brand new iPhone.No big deal  I thought I would replace it for $250 or so. This is what I paid when I signed my contract with the carrier. But what I didn't realize that the phone was subsidized  and the cost of a replacement phone was much higher. 850 dollars.To me  that was a crazy amount to spend on a phone. A friend offered me his old Blackberry (a very nice one  actually  but not an iPhone)  and I started using that.
