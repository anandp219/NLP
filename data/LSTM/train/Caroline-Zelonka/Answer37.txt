  Speaking as someone who's naturally eyebrow-challenged  sometimes there is not enough hair to form any sort of attractive shape. And if you're going to pencil them in anyway  you might as well do it on a smooth surface. I went in for a waxing once. This was in my 30s  when I had more eyebrow hairs than I did now. The waxing person took one look at me and said  "Oh  honey  there's nothing to wax!" And she warned me that waxing would possibly damage the few hairs I had left. Luckily  at the time  extremely thin  penciled eyebrows were in style  so for a few years I simply bleached my eyebrow hairs  trimmed them neatly (well  as much as I could given the fact that the hairs are few and far between) and then drew on a brow with a sticky eyeliner-type pencil in a taupe shade.
