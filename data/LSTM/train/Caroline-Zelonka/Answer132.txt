  I did  post 9-11. It was on a small local airline (Horizon Air  a subsidiary of Alaska Airlines) on a Seattle-to-Portland flight  which takes about a half hour.It was one of those small-plane flights that boarded from the tarmac  so passengers were directed down these fenced paths. Well  at this particular gate  two Horizon flights were boarding. And me with my terrible sense of direction took a wrong turn at one point.I get on the plane  find my seat and start to settle in. Captain gets on and does his usual speech  and I am barely listening  but my ears perk up when he said  "...and I'll be your pilot on this flight to Medford..."Medford?!
