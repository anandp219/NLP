)For the software company  the leads were similar: people who had attended a free seminar in business computing (computers being a bit of a novelty for personal users  but affordable enough for small businesses to own and use).The problem with the warm leads is that they were like the Glen Ross leads from Glengarry Glen Ross. These contacts were mature; these people had gotten dozens of similar sales calls over the years  and they largely were not interested. So most were not receptive to my message  or the freaking script for that matter.
