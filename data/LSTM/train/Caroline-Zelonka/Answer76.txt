  I am so glad someone asked this question  as I would have loved to have Quora around when I rushed in 1985. I pledged Alpha Chi Omega  which wasn't among my top choices  but it wasn't too bad. Later I learned it was known as the "smart girl" house  which may give credence to the first fact on the list.You don't necessarily choose the house  the house chooses you: Everything looks generic on the outside  because sorority girls more or less look the same. But the girls will know if your personality  values  study habits and the like "mesh" with the house.
