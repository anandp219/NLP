I laugh to think about what would happen if this were to occur in 2015 (and there was video to show). The public would be horrified  our parents would probably be arrested and charged  and nobody would likely be allowed to venture outside the immediate confines of the campground until it had been reliably de-bearified. But this being the early 1970s  it just made for an interesting story to tell around the campfire.
