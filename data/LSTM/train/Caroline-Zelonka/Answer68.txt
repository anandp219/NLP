Finally  a style that actually looked youthful (combovers are horribly aging) that guys with thinning hair could embrace! Besides the way it looked  it also gave the man an air of confidence. He wouldn't have to worry about the pasted-over bacon strip falling over while walking outside  speaking in front of a crowd  playing soccer or whatever. I do think some guys look better with hair  sure. But the thing is  there are tons and tons and tons of guys who lose it and so far  there is no better aesthetic alternative than shaving or cropping the hair short.
