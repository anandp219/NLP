  This question reminds me of the adage  "Don't believe everything you think." And the more life experience I get  the more I find myself thinking in shades of grey  and my agreements becoming more context-based and contingent.I certainly will upvote some answers that I disagree with. I don't know everything  and even things I think I know may not be true in certain circumstances. Especially those which I have arrived at by observation  rather than direct experience. (And even direct experience can be skewed  because it's often anecdotal and may cause me to selectively pay attention to other anecdotal phenomena through the Salience (neuroscience) effect.For example  I've upvoted answers on the eating disorders/anorexia topic  even though I bristle when folks make the assumption that all anorexics are unduly influenced by images in the media.
