  A2A. I actually work with a major city newspaper on native advertising  and I can tell you exactly how it works. Basically  the newsroom is kept apart from the advertising and marketing departments. Separation of church and state.Native advertising doesn't just originate in the marketing department  it stays there. Writers  such as myself  are employed to work with the client to come up with native content. If it needs photography  it's shot by an outside photographer (we don't have someone in-house)  or more commonly  a stock photo is used.
