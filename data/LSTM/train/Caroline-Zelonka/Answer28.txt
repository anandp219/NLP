There was a rumor that male masturbation lowered prostate cancer risk  but no clear association was found. I suppose that it's also illegal if performed in certain settings  like a children's park  but the same is true for marijuana  even in places where it's legal.The truth is: neither one is very bad  and doing one can enhance the pleasure of the other.
