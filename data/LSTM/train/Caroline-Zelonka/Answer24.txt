  To add to Archie D'Cruz' excellent answer  the internet also has something to do with it. Advertisers used to put a lot of information into their ads because the consumer couldn't easily find it anywhere else.Today  it's easy enough to include a URL (or a QR code  though those things have not caught on  thank god) where anyone can easily delve deeper into the product features  benefits  specifications  pricing  shipping information  even consumer reviews and third-party endorsements.Traditional advertising used to be an important engine of consumer education  but at a price.
