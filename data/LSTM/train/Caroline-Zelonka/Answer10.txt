Quite often  these can turn into regular freelance gigs.3. Work your connections. I'd say that about 80 percent of my freelance work comes from former colleagues (who have moved on to different agencies and corporate marketing departments) and referrals from those colleagues. Develop a good reputation as a reliable  high-quality writer  and you will likely be top-of-mind when it comes to writing work. LinkedIn and Facebook can be great for this. Send an email to folks you know  or have worked with  and tell them you are available for freelance work.
