At the time  I dismissed this as a scare story  but I have since come across ads for devices like the Tech-7 'incredible coin-sized camera' designed to 'get a visual record of your babysitter's actions' and 'watch employees to prevent theft'. It was the threat or rumour of hidden recording devices that provided the final capitalist-industrial touch: supervision.What makes the work most factory-like  though  is the intense regimen imposed by the companies. Deviations are subject to rebuke  as I discovered when a team leader caught me moving my arm from right to left  then left to right  while wiping Windex over a French door.
