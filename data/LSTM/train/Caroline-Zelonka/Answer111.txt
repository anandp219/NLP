Chores that seem effortless at home  even almost recreational  quickly turn nasty when performed hour after hour  with few or no breaks and under relentless time pressure.Having cleaned the rooms of many overly privileged teenagers in my stint with The Maids  I've come to the conclusion that the American overclass is raising a generation of young people who will  without constant assistance  suffocate in their own detritus.Almost everything we buy is the product of some other person's suffering and miserably underpaid labour.
