My answer stands. I can't speak for why women would be that interested in it. However  one commenter supplied  as evidence  this profile:Im a 20-year-old girl studying mathy things at a college. Ravenclaw/Ravenclaw  INTJ  phlegmatic  Miranda  assigned Scorpio at birth but I identify as VirgoI like effective altruism  LaTeX  planning things  arugula  and Chateau Heartiste. There are other things I like but they are probably all linear combinations of the above.I only write in cursive.My greatest accomplishment is that I was on Arthur when I was 7.Yes  technically a 20-year-old is a woman  not a girl  but based on her profile (the astrology things  especially) she seems a bit juvenile as well.
