And even when cops do show up  it's unlikely that any individual person will suffer significant penalties. (Of course  alcoh0l is also involved in more serious crimes  such as drinking and driving  but that's a separate issue. )There is not a lot of peer or societal pressure to abstain from drinking  just because it's illegal. In college  it's also easier to hide it from parents  who may have imposed certain additional sanctions that would discourage young people from drinking.I guess the simple answer would be: why would they want to wait?
