  I would. Why not? I don't see why anyone serious would seriously object.Look at user generated community sites all over the web - Wikipedia is pretty much a bizarre and awesome exception where it was possible to create a ad-free business model that worked.I'm working on another one at TPO (online community funded by mobile phone service) - hopefully that will work as well. But in general  I have no objection to advertising as a business model - Wikia uses it to good effect.The only thing that I do object to is people who get angry about any business model of any form.
