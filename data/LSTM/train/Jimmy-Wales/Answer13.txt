The only real purpose of the provocation is the provocation.As you are a teenager  and not a 4 year old  I recommend the same to your mother: she should ignore you. And as for you  you may wish to sit in a chair for 5 minutes and contemplate what is bothering you in life to make you behave like a 4 year old. If there's an issue you should really talk to your mother about regarding boundaries and life expectations  it'll go much better if you just address it in a mature way. Acting out over something as silly as a bathrobe on an airplane is not really going to get you where you want to go in life  wherever that may be.
