  I googled the phrase "self destroying encryption keys" and the only use of that phrase that I can find is... this question.There really isn't any such thing as a "self destroying encryption key".UPDATE: Ok  so you've edited the question and clarified in a comment what you are looking for.I don't believe there is any such specific requirement  but in a well-designed system  the only thing that the company will have access to is the *encrypted* version of the password  which means that they can't get access to the *plaintext* version except through brute-forcing  which is quite difficult if you choose a long enough password.
