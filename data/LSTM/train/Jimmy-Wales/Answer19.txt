The nearest star (Alpha Centauri) is 4.37 light years away.So using technology that doesn't exist yet  but which is plausible  this would be a mission to the middle of nowhere. My guess is that the inhabitants would quickly start spending all their time figuring out how to turn the ship around and come back.
