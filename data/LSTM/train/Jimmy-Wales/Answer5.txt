  Have something good to tradeOften people wind up in this situation because they've booked late and there were only individual seats scattered around. If you have 2 middle seats  it's going to be hard to trade that for an aisle or window  because people don't usually want to give up an aisle or window to be stuck in the middle.People are generally nice and will gladly trade like-for-like if they are traveling alone. So if you have an aisle and a middle or two aisle seats  you've got a good chance at doing the swap.
