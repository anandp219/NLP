I'm knowledgeable but far from an expert - but I'm pretty sure that there is no formally written legal obstacle forbidding the Queen from standing for election as a Member of Parliament - but it would be considered highly unconstitutional.I believe if a monarch for some reason wanted to pursue this course of action  Parliament would act to force an abdication. Or to abolish the monarchy completely.
