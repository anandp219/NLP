(Not so good at taking my own. But well!) Problem solving. I can easily process issues and break them down into pieces. Most people come to me in trouble and I feel happy to help them. Whether its legal advice or general. I have been able to help many people and to this day enjoy doing it.I see the deeper reasons. I see the meaning behind words that most often the speaker herself isn't able to express. I am also great at analyzing myself or others. Flip side - The flip side of intelligence is over analysis of things.
