  I used to but I do not anymore. That's because I don't look down upon anyone now. At least I try. The only thing is  it is unlikely that I will have anything to talk to them after a point. Unless they have traveled a lot or are otherwise exposed to a lot of different areas through their work. But such people most often tend to be readers!In my experience  people who don't read tend to know less. Having an open mind has more to do with being a tad bit skeptic! And I do believe reading helps with that because reading expands our imagination and mind.
