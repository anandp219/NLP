There is no 'default law' or Uniform civil code that would apply to you without inquiring into your religion. So  legally  you cannot be an Atheist. But nobody will bother you if you don't believe in a religion. You can choose to not be associated  but in certain matters  the law would apply. High time the current government at least shows some spine and get a Uniform Civil Code and be done with religious laws. One law for every Indian.
