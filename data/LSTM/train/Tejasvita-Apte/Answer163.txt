Since it was a very small argument  I was asked to argue. This was just 2 years back. I looked tiny in front of the senior advocate. He looked complacent ( as many senior advocates do!). After I finished my argument the judge told me 'well argued'. (She also later passed an order in my favour!) As I left and came out of the court room  the advocate followed. He told me he never expected me to argue so well. I politely just asked him why! He was a tad bit uncomfortable at my question and quickly mumbled that generally girls as young as I  didn't.
