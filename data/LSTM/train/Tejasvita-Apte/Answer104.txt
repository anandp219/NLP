For this context here  I do not mean the worry you feel for your loved one when they are battling cancer! I speak only in the context of this question. Let's say you are going for an adventure. Let's say you are going to trek the Himalayas. It is your dream. But it is also a bit dangerous. As your lover  I am concerned. Now I can give two different kind of reactions. Scene one - I say - Hey I am really concerned about you. I will be a little worried because the trek is dangerous but I know it's your dream.
