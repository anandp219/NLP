  Because often when an elastic gets too stretched on one side  after you release it  it has to bounce back a little towards the other before it comes to a balance. Because you cannot have a running race when the starting point itself for the participants is different. If that is the case  then you need to first get the other runners to the base line by carrying them in vehicles (Affirmative action) and then they can compete. Remember this has nothing to do with inherent weakness. I support only one kind of reservation for women.
