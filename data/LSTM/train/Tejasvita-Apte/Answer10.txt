But reading isn't the only thing that helps in being open. The other thing that should follow reading  is contemplating. Reading provides an excellent springboard for contemplation. I interact with people normally. But often  if the person doesn't read or travel  or learn something new all the time  I run out of things to talk. So  vis a vis me  I may term that person uninteresting.
