  Therapy as a profession is complex. It is highly subjective. What works for one person may not work for another in identical situation. Each therapy is different. Therapists often combine a lot of techniques and bring in a lot from their own experience. An otherwise successful therapist may not 'click' with you. Which is why it is important to get a few things straight. Separate 'ineffective' therapy from 'unprofessional or hurtful'. The two are different. While the former may only be a waste of time or money  it is never truly damaging.
