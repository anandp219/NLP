Indo Dravidian Languages include the 4 south Indian languages ( Tamil  Telugu  Kannada and Malayalam) along with the dialects thereof. Sino Indian languages are languages of the North-East India.The rest of the languages are Indo-Aryan (like Hindi  Marathi  Gujarati  Bengali etc.) At the time of framing of the Constitution 24% of India's population spoke Indo Dravidian Languages with 12% among them speaking Telugu. So  any Indo Dravidian language becoming the Official language of India was simply not practical.
