They will get justiceHowever  as the Fatwa gets strength from the religion; it causes serious psychological impact on the person intending not to abide by that. Having regard to the fact that a Fatwa has the potential of causing immense devastation  we feel impelled to add a word of caution. We would like to advise the Dar-ul-Qaza or for that matter anybody not to give any response or issue Fatwa concerning an individual  unless asked for by the person involved or the person having direct interest in the matter.
