It was only recently that I opened my mind to the possibility that being beautiful was a good thing. A gift! Today I try to take equal care of my mind and body. Though I will always be partial to my mind and its pursuits  I do not look down on the pursuits of the body. I feel that I kind of won a genetic lottery. I am beautiful as well as intelligent. I have many varied talents. And I should be thankful. I should make the most of it all and enjoy it. Lastly  I understood that I enjoy being appreciated for my beauty though I'd hate to be limited to it.
