  Well  it's complicated. In the sense that the legal position is not very clear. You will not be affected by religion if you don't let yourself be. You are allowed to not follow any religion (or follow) and you are allowed to convert into another by choice. You are allowed to marry under the Special Marriage Act if you are not inclined to have a religious wedding. The problem comes in succession. Adoption. If you are a Hindu  you are governed by the Hindu Adoption and maintenance Act. If you are a Muslim  you cannot adopt unless you follow the specific set of conditions.
