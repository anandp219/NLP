(2) The biggest and most prestigious school to whom people write for resolving of their religious queries is 'Darul Uloom Deoband' in Uttar Pradesh. Darul Ifta is one of its departments. There are plethora of Fatwas issued by them and the content of most of them would make any rational person both laugh and after a point maybe cry at the idiocy involved. Please note that every question / example I have quoted here is asked and referred to on the website. There is an excellent book by Aroun Shourie called 'The world of Fatwas' where he has quoted all of these in their hard copies with indices and volume numbers.
