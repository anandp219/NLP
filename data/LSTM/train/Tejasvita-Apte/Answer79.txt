Or start with Taranas (the Carnatic equivalent is Thillana). Tarana is a composition where syllables are chosen for their rhythmic beauty and pleasing sound and don't have any meaning.Excellent for beginners. Enjoy the music. Flow with it and be mindful of the things it evokes within you.Music is my life's greatest pleasure. :)Just FYI - By the end of it though  I hope you know you don't have to like Hindustani classical music!
