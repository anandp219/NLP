  In India - Fatwas are not necessarily death threats. The ones that become famous of course are about death threats. But there are lots of other harmless ones. Ridiculous though most of them nevertheless are. Fatwas are where religious opinion is asked and the religious scholar responds. There are some Fatwas which are issued suo moto too. As far as the legality of such fatwas is concerned  they are the same as the rubbish that goes on in Nirmal Baba's sabha. Not legally enforceable but you cannot do anything if one fool asks the other what should be the length of his beard according to Islam and decides to follow the Fatwa  or believes that it is sanctioned by his god.
