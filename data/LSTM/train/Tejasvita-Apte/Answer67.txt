He is hit under the waist against the rules of the mace battle. One possible explanation is already well articulated by Ishita. I would try and look at it from another perspective. And again  this is my perspective. Very personal. I think throughout Mahabharata  everyone is trying to find 'Dharma'. But it remains elusive. We never get an answer. Whether it is Krishna convincing Arjuna to fight with his impeccable arguments  or it is Karna remaining loyal to Duryodhana despite knowing that he is Kunti's son  or it is Bheeshma sticking to his vow despite there being dire necessity for him to let it go  or any other situation  where every character ends up making a choice.
