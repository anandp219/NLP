The truth of course is the fact that the rendition is so nuanced  that a lay ear cannot capture the intricacy. Which is why a lot of people find it boring  monotonous or drone like. So  as a beginner  you can start with Drut Bandish (fast tempo) of any raaga. Then go to Madhya lay (medium tempo) and then Vilambit lay (slow tempo).If I have to use an analogy  I can compare it with the movements in Art! (There you go. I can't help evoke a visual with sound! Even if it is intellectual.) We attained a sort of zenith with classicism.
