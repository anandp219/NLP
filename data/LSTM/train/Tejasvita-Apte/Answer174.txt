  By taking it one day at a time. One battle at a time. One moment at a time. Battling suicidal feelings is terrible. If I have to use an analogy  I would say it's similar to the gut wrenching feeling you have right before you are going to vomit. A lot of people think it is just a thought and you can get rid of it when you want. But I know it is not. It is a thought you can feel physically  in your gut. So believe me  I know coping with it is not easy. Please go see a therapist. She can help you.
