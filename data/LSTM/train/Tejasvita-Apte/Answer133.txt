  I agree with Harshal. The answer to this question is  you can't. I have always felt music was born when man desired to express something which couldn't be expressed in words. Sound has a deep impact on humans. We tend to be naturally musical. Language and music are deeply connected too. There has always been a debate as to whether the two developed together or independently. Rousseau (a writer as well as a musician) opined that both music and language emerged together  as a singsong speech. They possible diverged later.Steven Pinker  in 'The language instinct  says - What benefit could there be to diverting time and energy to making plinking noises?
