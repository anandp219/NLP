The minute my father came to know  he asked some of the boys who used to attend his Shaakha ( RSS meet) for help. These were 20 year old boys. For the next 9 months  one or the other boy would sleep in the hospital with that man. Every night. My teacher still ties Raakhi to my father and two others who were there for her in her time of need. This is RSS. To this day  I am confident that if I go to any unknown city  I can go to the house of a person from RSS and I am certain I will be taken care of.
