When parents overdo the "Oh you are very special" with their children  they deceive them. I think appreciating every thing the child does  even if they suck at it  is unhealthy and deceptive. Trying to learn something new as an approach should be encouraged and appreciated  but if the child draws a monkey while aiming to draw an elephant  she should be told what it really looks like. And rather than saying she did a great job  she should be told it is not great drawing but if she enjoys drawing she should do it anyway.Parents should know the difference between appreciating the effort and appreciating the final product.
