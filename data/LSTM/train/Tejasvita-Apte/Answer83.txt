Anything which is obvious isn't really novel. Pick your choice. Either of the two may work. The former needs your skills  the latter is more of a 'Flash of genius' and may or may not happen in your life. Lastly  I hope you know it's okay to not have any new ideas! Not all of us are meant to be scientists or artists. Some of us are accountants! And the world needs them too. :)
