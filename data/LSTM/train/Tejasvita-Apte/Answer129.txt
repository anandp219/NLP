So  you've got to take a blind leap of faith. 3. Do not presume a moral high ground - Most often the deceived spouse is going to feel - "Do you think I didn't feel attracted to others? But I didn't go cheat. I didn't stoop as low as you." Presuming a moral high ground will never work if you wish to fix the relationship. It will initially make the person who cheated more guilty but above that nothing else. You end up increasing the gap between you two. She not only feels guilty  she also now can never talk to you about the affair openly because you bring morality into the picture and she will feel judged.
