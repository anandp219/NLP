There is also the problem that a lot of men feel intimidated by my intelligence. I never intend to but I somehow make them feel insecure. They are more likely to like me (or accept me) for my beauty than my intellect. (This has been my experience so far. I don't in any way wish to generalize. In fact I genuinely hope to meet more men interested in my intellect than I have). My kind of intelligence has the curse of being too mature for my age. I am just 26 years old but I swear I mentally can relate to people in their 40s.
