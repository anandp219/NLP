So  break a leg! Enjoy. I am waiting for you  eager to hear all about it! Scene two - I say- Hey I am very worried about you. Do you know how dangerous it is? I will not allow you to go because I cannot bear to lose you. If you also felt the same about me  you wouldn't go. If you go  that tells me you are abandoning me. You don't love me. In both these scenarios  you are expressing concern. But in the former it is caring. The latter is worry. The former has the other person's thought at the base.
