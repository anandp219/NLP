So  it is this emotional investment  the desire to express something special  that gives birth to the art form. It then makes sense to name it after that desire  motivation  inspiration or thought. This is what I believe. To prove my point  I present - 'Touch me there' by L.Shankar and Frank Zappa - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...It touches you there! :) Enjoy. (Wait till the violin starts)
