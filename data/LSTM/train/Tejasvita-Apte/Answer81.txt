Paluskar. If I am not wrong  they are all recorded under the label called 'Golden milestones'. 4. Aan sunai Bansari Kaan by Gundecha Brothers (Raag Komal Rishabh Asavari) -Dhrupadhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...I can seriously die listening to Dhrupad by Gundecha Brothers. Hypnotic. I tend to like Dhrupad more than Khyal sometimes! For excellent fusion  try Instrumentalists and groups like Shakti (another band I love! )  though it is not strictly a fusion of Hindustani classical. Start from things you like and explore more!
