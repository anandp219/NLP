With Hindustani classical music  my interest and love grew with a lot of time and serious listening. Let me tell you something about classical music (Specially Hindustani classical music) - Hindustani classical music is melody based (So is Carnatic). Any rendition  starts with Vilambit lay (very slow tempo)  then you have Madhya lay (medium tempo)  and then Drut lay (Fast tempo). Our ears are not exposed to appreciate the nuances of Vilambit (slow tempo). We haven't acquired the taste. It sounds the same.
