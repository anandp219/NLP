. . . As far as biological cause and effect are concerned  music is useless....It could vanish from our species and the rest of our lifestyle would be virtually unchanged.Regardless of whether or not it serves a biological or evolutionary purpose  music has been there for centuries and will never cease to exist. There is something profoundly emotional about music. I feel it touches those parts of our subconscious that are not accessible otherwise. The stimulation clearly is very pleasurable. The inexpressible depth of music  Schopenhauer writes  so easy to understand and yet so inexplicable  is due to the fact that it reproduces all the emotions of our innermost being  but entirely without reality and remote from its pain.... Music expresses only the quintessence of life and of its events  never these themselves.I agree with him.
