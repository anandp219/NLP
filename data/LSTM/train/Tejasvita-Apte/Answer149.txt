Chaitanya was a great anchor. Although he was a tad bit nervous at the beginning he had no reason to be so! Barsha  other organizers and volunteers were extremely enthusiastic and warm. To be honest  I had no idea Quora was so popular! Or that so many people knew me! I was surprised to see more than 500 (I am told the number was a whopping 550+) students in the audience!! I was also happy to answer their interesting questions! Ranging from law  to psychology  to politics  to sociology  to current affairs  start-ups  Yoga  Game of thrones  women in India  we discussed plethora of issues!
