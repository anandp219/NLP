You will know)  the reason to stray has less to do with you (or rejecting you) and more to do with either the third person or your partner's own self. What she feels in your relationship (or what she has become as a result)  is what she is rejecting. Not you. That is what she wants to go away from. Not necessarily you. That is why  before taking it all very personally  inquire. Once you know the reason and are certain you love her too  move ahead to making it work. Know that it is both your responsibility and not hers alone.
