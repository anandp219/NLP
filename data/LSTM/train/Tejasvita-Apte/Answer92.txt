  I don't know what 'should' be done. Frankly  that word always puts me off! I always tread very carefully when people start talking about 'shoulds'!I am more interested in inquiring into the reasons of the fixation with 'should' than the 'should'. But my OCD aside  here's what I think! Personal opinion - 'You've got to do what you've got to do whether you want it or not'Plain and simple. Know that even in situations you feel helpless in  where you think you have no choice  you are still making a choice.
