  Is RSS really that bad? Absolutely not. RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) is a nationalist organization. I have seen and experienced just the opposite of what is reported. I grew up in a very 'Sanghi' environment! I grew up around RSS. My father used to be a Sanghachalak for many years. Most of his friends have been in RSS. Most of my family has been associated with RSS with my grand parents supporting RSS against the British rule. All I learnt and saw was love for India (matrubhoomi) and service to the society.
