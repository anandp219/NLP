I enjoy listening to any foreign tongue. It is highly pleasurable. I also listen to music without paying heed to the language. My brain is so trained to ignore the words while listening to music that I have to take efforts to appreciate the lyrics! As a result  I can sing in about 15-16 languages without understanding the words at all. My musical memory seems to be superb! So no  there is no way around it. Man is a musical creature too. Just as he is a linguistic and sexual creature. You cannot have alternatives to that.
