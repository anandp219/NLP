  There is a simple reason behind that. The reason is - When you do Vipassana  they ask you to stop every other practice you have been doing. Including Yoga or any other physical exercise you have been doing. Truth be told  Yoga or other similar practices are very conducive to Vipassana. But then if you do it all together you won't be able to see the exact effect Vipassana has on you. You won't know what contributed how much. This is the reason they ask you to stop everything else and only do Vipassana when you do a course.
