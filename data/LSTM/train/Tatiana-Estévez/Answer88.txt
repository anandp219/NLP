Generally we try not to sanction users for this and instead we encourage them to fix their question  we may tag it with one of the Needs Improvement topics or Quora Moderation may give a specific reason. When it comes to questions about groups of people though  we tend to be more aggressive. Myself in particular will aggressively delete questions that seem to be making a point about a group of people rather asking an open question  particularly if asked anonymously. If you think that one of your questions has been unfairly deleted by moderation you may email appeals@quora.com.
