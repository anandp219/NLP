They will usually be a lot clearer about the scope of work and the deliverables required. Example: We invite you to bid to be the supplier for an employee engagement survey which will be for 6 000 of our 10 000 employees in 20 countries  in 18 languages. 80% of the surveys will be online but 20% or our employees will need access to a paper version. Request for Proposal (RFP) This is slightly different in the presentation. Here a problem or need and their requirement will be defined in the RFP and it is up to the supplier to make a proposal on how they fulfil this requirement.
