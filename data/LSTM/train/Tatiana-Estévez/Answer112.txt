  The advice here is conventional wisdom that we'll often hear  particularly when starting out in our career. I don't want to say that it is bad per se  but just that there are times when not following it  did work well for me. Dont lie on your CV or interviewThis is the main one were told right. Never lie  youll be caught out and bad things will happen to you and even if youve worked for the company for 20 years  should they find a single mistake in your CV you can say goodbye to your job. Well it is probably true there is no point lying about the big stuff  but there is one area that I have told some little fibs on and that is when it comes to what software I know how to use.
