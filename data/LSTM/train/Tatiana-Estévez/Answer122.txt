New introduction: Kind of like the new product range  but one that already exists in other markets. We sold a much larger range of products in France than we did in the UK. New colours: Colours are discontinued and added to all the time. There are several factors involved in the rationale of these. These new products would generally coincide with our promotion cycle which was every two months. We would launch extra colours off-cycle  but generally they would eventually get on the promotion cycle.
