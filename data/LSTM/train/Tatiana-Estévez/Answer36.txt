No one was thinking that much  but theyve built a brand on the concept of real beauty  real beauty meaning that compared to the average model  theyre a bit shorter  a bit bigger  a few years older  oh and they dont Photoshop women until theyre unrecognisable  but theyre not going to any real risks here  were not going to see any real challenges to what we already perceive as beautiful. The real aim of these campaigns  is just make beauty seem more attainable to the average woman. They're actually making people associate their product with realistic expectations of what it can achieve on a beauty level and at the same time make make women feel like they're embracing their 'real beauty'.
