Youve let them down. You didnt do what they wanted to you to do even though it was really important to them. 'It was so important to me that you turned up that day  because I really needed your support because my ex was there. I thought I would be more important than your hair appointment' This reproach will come after the event and not as a request for assistance beforehand. Trying to reason with them that you didn't know will not work as that would be not recognising how 'special' your friendship is.Guilt.
