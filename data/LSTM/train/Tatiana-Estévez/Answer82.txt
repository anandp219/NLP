  I used to be a beauty therapist  with a specialty in aromatherapy. Aromatherapy is about getting the benefits of essential oils into your system. The usual ways of doing this is via inhalation or massage. Generally you cannot charge much for asking people to sniff some oils so when booking 'aromatherapy' in most spas you can expect a massage with essential oils. First I would sit down with a client and have a short chat about what they were looking for  the usual thing is people want to relax and destress.
