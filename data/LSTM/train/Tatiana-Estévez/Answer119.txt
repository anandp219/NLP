Neither of which was possible. My boss had long since left so I felt free to tell them they were all crazy people and there was no possible way they could go on as they thought and I was going to create some tools for them to save them - I wish I could say I used much better words than that  but they were probably worse. I really needed to get them to understand they couldn't do things their way any more and they needed to understand that immediately. Luckily one of the team members knew enough about excel to realise I made sense and we collaborated.
