They only display testers  so they can justify a much more thorough ranges of colours  the stock is not taking up the prime retail counter shelf and the majority is below in cupboards or just hidden towards the back of the shelves and they can just keep more of the popular colours. So if youre looking for a really accurate skin colour match  or you happen to be one of the millions of women who are darker than 'warm sand'  then you may find it a lot easier to go to a premium brand if you want a good match colour for your skin.
