  I worked for global HR consultancy and for four years I was the proposal writer for their Talent and Rewards segment (making some contributions to the Benefits segment). Proposals came in many shapes and forms and I worked mostly in formal bid procedures  responding to RFPs (request for proposals)  RFIs (request for information) and pitch documents. I think these are the 5 prime challenges that I found with most proposals I worked on. Limited time and resources. Deadlines are always short  there have been times weve had two days to write a 30 page proposal to a company and other clients are never understanding.
