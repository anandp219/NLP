I was supposed to work 9am to 5pm  but I started at 8am and most nights I was there until 9-10pm  if I left at 7pm Id always get someone pleased for me that I managed to leave early. It was several years before anyone told me I should have been expensing my dinner and taking a taxi home  just like everyone else did. This went on for a long period of time  I kept telling my boss that I couldn't sustain the long hours and I was having to turn a lot of work away and she just kept stressing that once I prove that we had enough work she would increase our resources.
