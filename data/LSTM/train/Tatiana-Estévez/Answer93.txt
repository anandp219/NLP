Going to Sainsbury's and buying lots of teacakes and doughnuts will be viewed just as positively as buying a deluxe Opera cake from Pauls; as long as they are plentiful. You should make sure there are enough for everyone and a few stray people who coincidentally happen to be walking by at strategic and opportune times. If at the end of the day there isn't enough cake to feed another half a dozen people  you probably didn't buy enough.On a fairly regular basis a brown envelope will appear on your desk with a list of names some crossed out some not.
