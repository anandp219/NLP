In fairness  for that particular example we were actually given one month by the client  for some reason no one actually thought to start on it except two days before  because you know  impossible deadlines are fun. Even when you are given a lot more notice  it is hard to convince people to give up billable hours for a proposal that may or may not be won  and as for getting the senior directors times is even more difficult.Not knowing what the client wants. In large companies RFPs are put together by a procurement team.
