  If you're worried and you cannot get a definitive answer to address that worry  then why would you take the risk for $400? Even if the risk is small  if it does affect your career  the consequences will cost far more than $400. As to whether or not it will affect your future career  it is going to depend a lot on what future career is. Graphic Designer? I don't think anyone will care. Teacher? Yeah  there is a good chance that people might care  but as said in another answer  if it is tasteful you might be fine.
