  They are trying to do you a favour and allowing you to resign. This means when you go to job interviews you can have your story ready for why this company didn't suit you and why you're the one looking for a better opportunity. This is much much better than having to tell interviewers that you were fired from your last job after a month and explaining to them why you're a bad fit for a small company.You should also consider this feedback carefully. To me what this feedback means is that you probably didn't try to do anything outside of your given role and just did what you think you were there to do.
