  The key sign that someone is trying to manipulate you is that they are making their emotional state dependent on you and the things you do. To some extent this is natural  if someone you care for does something nice for you  this makes you feel good if they do something you dislike  you will feel bad  but when people pass on the responsibility of those feelings to actions that they have no control of   thats when you know youre being manipulated. Recognising the telltale signs can be difficult due to the emotional components that are so strong.
