  Women don't reply to men's messages when they are unsolicited and unwelcome. They are here to share their knowledge with people and engage in intellectual discussion. When guys are genuine about just 'wanting to talk and nothing else' they don't just message women out of the blue. There is a period where they interact in discussions in comments. They know if a woman is not responding to their comments then she may be busy or she may not be interested in having a discussion with him  they don't then message her  because they know that it isn't appropriate.
