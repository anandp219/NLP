With this situation you just have to make a lot of assumptions  but you dont want to over-price based on those assumptions  so you price for a core product or service  you can add an extra section for other services and you make sure it is clearly scoped what this would include.Bizarre  seemingly irrelevant questions. Some of the questions asked by a company are about due diligence could be extremely broad and generic in order to cater for all vendors. Ive had to answer the most bizarre questions that have nothing to do the product.
