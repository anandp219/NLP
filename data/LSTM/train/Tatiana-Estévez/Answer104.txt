The more quality products will tend to be smoother and more consistent in application. Top strip is from Rimmel (the cheapest)  the second strip is the next price up (Sally Hansen) and the bottom is the most expensive (Nails Inc). ColourNormally the pigment will be better and there may be more of it  which makes the colour more intense  in the more expensive brands. This agains helps with consistency.Although I do notice these differences  I do think they are marginal though. If I liked the colour I'd happily buy the cheaper brand and I think Rimmel is actually great value.
