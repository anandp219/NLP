Many a hapless outsider has enjoyed this banter so much they have joined in  to suddenly find chairs spun around and having HR walk past their desk at regular intervals for the rest of the week asking how are they. Banter between colleagues is a very difficult thing to get right and not only that  a lot of the people you think are getting it right are getting it wrong but are tolerated for other reasons. Maybe theyve been in the company many years and have earned some latitude. You wont be penalised for not joining in  but you will have problems if you get it wrong.
