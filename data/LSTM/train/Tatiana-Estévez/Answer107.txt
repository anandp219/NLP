  There are no absolutes to recognising an expensive perfume from a cheap one. So much of what we find appealing about smell is linked to buried memories and what we associate a smell with. However if we're talking in general there are a few tendencies that might apply. Cheap perfume tends to smell sweeter than average. This isn't because sweet smelling ingredients are just cheaper than others (although they can be)  but because cheap perfume tends to be marketed for younger people (who tend to have less money).
