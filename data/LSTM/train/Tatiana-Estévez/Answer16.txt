This is not to say there arent some differences with the products and there is one key difference between premium and the mid-priced cosmetics that youll find on the shelves of Boots and Walmart and that is range of colours. Budget and mid-priced cosmetics are bought primarily off the shelf  at the front of the shelf youll see the tester and behind it youll see the stock of that colour. This means that each colour that is part of that range is taking up primary self space  and those cosmetic companies have to justify every shade of every product it wants to have on the shelf.
