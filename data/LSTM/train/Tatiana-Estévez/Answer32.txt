  This is inline with how Dove have been advertising for a long time. They have these feel good ads that try and send the message that we as women should be challenging perceptions of ourselves and liberating ourselves from our insecurities. Were not really ugly or average  it is society telling us that were not attractive as we are and actually if we just accept ourselves well see that were really beautiful. Thats our choice. Sounds good eh? What is the real message of this ad though? Look at the women theyve chosen  sure I have no doubt some of these women have insecurities about themselves  but lack of make-up and dowdy clothes and the coyly apprehensive expressions on these womens faces  do not hide that these women are all above average in looks.
