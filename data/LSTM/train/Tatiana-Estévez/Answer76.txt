  Matching handbags/purses precisely with shoes used to be a sign of someone who took a lot of care with their appearance  but now it isn't considered necessary and can even look a bit dated. However  if you wish to be considered stylish then you should definitely be coordinating your bag and shoes and making sure they don't clash. Coordinating doesn't always mean the same colour  but that the colours work together. You should also take into consideration the material of the bag  for example  you possibly wouldn't carry an all patent bag if you're wearing all suede shoes even if they're the same colour.
