It was a source of great frustration that I had to leave them to it. One day I heard about one of their projects for their most demanding client. They told me what they had committed to  some very fancy data heavy infographics  that were completely different from the information they usually represented. As it stood they would have had to input the data in a different order for every chart. They had much less time than usual  yet to do things their way they needed to double the time needed and double their resources.
