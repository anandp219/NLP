In the new year when I submitted my expenses I was told hard luck I could no longer submit them and that was nearly 1 000 lost. My boss at the time was sacked for unrelated issues and there was no way of recouping this loss. A few years later I finally got the promotion but in a different role. It meant taking a lead in some areas and having to speak up in meetings. My suggestions would frequently be dismissed as not useful until 5 minutes later in the meeting when someone else would coincidently have the exact same thought as me and it instantly became the best idea ever.
