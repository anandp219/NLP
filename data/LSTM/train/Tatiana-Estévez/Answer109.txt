Then come the base notes which is what is left on your skin at the end of the day. One of the reasons fake perfumes do so well and are much cheaper to produce  is because they replicate the top notes of a perfume and if you're lucky the mid notes. If you want to compare a fake perfume with a real perfume  you shouldn't compare them when first spraying  but see how they both smell on your skin after 2 hours  4 hours and 6 hours. A cheaper perfume may smell bad or have no smell at all. Base notes in particular can be some of the more expensive ingredients in perfumery.
