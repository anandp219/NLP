I have no idea if she likes you or just sees you as a colleague  but I do know that the type of people who date people because they got a free lunch are probably not going to be a good long term prospect. The great thing about this scenario is that you're probably going to get to know her a lot better over the next few days/weeks. If you want to treat her  don't be extravagant  keep it classy  buy her a coffee  but don't put her in position where either of you feel like she is indebted to you. On an end note  one of the most successful men I know with women is this guy who refuses to treat any woman.
