In start-ups and other small business they don't have the luxury of employees who will only do their given role and they need people who are hands on and always looking for how they can do more work  even if that is work they don't normally do. The thing is that attitude isn't considered great for large companies either  it isn't that they want you doing work that you're not there to do  but they don't want jobsworth people who aren't willing to help out when needed. This is just my interpretation though  it would be good for you and your future career if you get as much understanding as possible on why you were a poor fit for the company.
