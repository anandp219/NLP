There is often a lot more vagueness on what the scope might be. Example: We would like to measure our employee engagement levels. We have have 10 000 employees in 30 countries  but we would like to do this in phases. 20% of our employees do not have access to a computer and will need to be provided with an alternative option.The Difference to the ClientAs you can see the criteria for the first is much more specific  whereas in the second it is more open. The proposal could be exactly the same on the other hand they may offer another option to the paper version of the survey (a mobile version for example)  they may also pick up on the 'phases' and make suggestions for smaller cheaper surveys  or they may have a completely different idea that doesn't involve traditional surveys.
