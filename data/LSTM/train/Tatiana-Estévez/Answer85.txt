  There is no PowerPoint 13  so I assume you mean PowerPoint 2013 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi...).It is still there  but just buried quite a bit. Easiest way to get it back up is: Switch on one of your toolbars - View  Toolbars - choose the toolbar you'd like to add this tool too. Then select View  Toolbars again and this time select Customize Toobars and Menus.Select 'Commands' Then in 'Categories' select 'Format'  scroll down until you see the eyedropper tool. You can then drag and drop these on to your toolbar.
