The investment bankers  yes that is rhyming slang I remember on my first day of working with an investment bank  I was told that if a banker ever wanted to shout and scream abuse at me that I should just shut up and take it. That was an interesting way to start. That kind of set the tone of working in investment banks and yes I was shouted and screamed at a lot. I remember one evening  it must have been gone midnight and it was up to me to tell someone that their requested deadline wasnt going to be met (I worked on the presentations team).
