  The trick here is to base your quote on assumptions rather than trying to take a wild guess at what might be required. Try and make these assumptions based on the time and requirements of similar projects. To keep your quote competitive  quote for the core service youre providing and then add the extras on top  as separate elements. Make sure it is clear that these are assumptions and anything outside of the defined scope of work will be charged as extra and at an hourly rate. This may not seem ideal  but your aim is to win the contract  without underselling yourself.
