Foundation colours really suffer here  and most people struggle to know if their skin is warm sand  golden sand  rosy sand or pale sand  so pulling some of the shades frequently doesnt make too much of a difference to their overall sales as people just go to the nearest colour  and instead they prefer to keep several formulas. The skin colours that really suffer here are the darker skin-tones. Women with a range of skin tones from pale to light olive  may get 4-8 shades to choose from  whereas women with skin-tones from medium olive all way to deep ebony will frequently have only 2 or 3 options  if that!Premium brands dont have the same limitations.
