  I work in the UK and Ive had to deal with some challenging working environments over the years. There was the boys clubI was a secretary and the only woman in a firm of consulting engineers and for some reason they decided that I  a secretary with zero experience  could replace the roles of a senior secretary and a junior secretary that had been there before me. Most of the time the guys were very friendly with me  in the way guys are when they are trying to hit on a woman. I didnt think too much of it though until we had a 16 year old boy working as intern over the summer.
