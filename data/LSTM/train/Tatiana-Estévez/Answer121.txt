  I used to work in Sales and Marketing for a French cosmetics company called Bourjois.New product launches could be categorised as follows: New product range: This would be an entire new range of a product for example lipsticks. The lipsticks would have a new formula with at least one specific feature  e.g. moisturising or long-lasting  the packaging would be new and the range of colours would be new. New formula: Much less frequently the formula of a popular product would be upgraded. This is not that common and is only done when the brand of that product still has value  normally it is preferable to just create a new product.
