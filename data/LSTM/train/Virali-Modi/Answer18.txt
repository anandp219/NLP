I would pass in and out of consciousness because I felt that I couldn't get enough oxygen  when that really wasn't the case. The doctors and nurses  to whom I'm really grateful for  would monitor my oxygen levels  to make sure I was getting enough oxygen. At that time  I remember I'd try to call the doctors and nurses to put me back on the machine because it was incredibly strenuous to breathe. They couldn't hear me  because I was paralyzed from the neck down and my lungs were incredibly weak  my voice was not audible.
