An added bonus: A good physique will definitely help you in the ladies department. Joining the gym and working out may just help you make friends  and possibly help you find a companion.All of these things are destractions to help you forget about that girl. If you really want to forget her  implement some of the things I've said (and other people will say). Other than that  it's really upto you. If you really want to forget her  you need to work on it. Time will help heal wounds  but those urges to talk and wish for more  need to stop.Hopefully this helps.
