Don't give a fuck about the future." (Those were his exact words).That's exactly what I did. Look where I am now  I'm being featured in newspapers  I was in the news  I did an ad shoot earlier this year  a couple of photo shoots  I perfomed in front of Zayed Khan and Jackky Bhagnani on a wheelchair  I'm Miss Wheelchair India runner up 2014  and I have almost 43k followers on Quora. I never expected this! I seriously never did! I always thought I'd do nothing in my life until my dad spoke to me.Life has a way of fucking everything up  teaching you lessons during your struggle  and then making it even better than before.
