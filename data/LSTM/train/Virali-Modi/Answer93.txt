I've received similar messages from people on Quora  Twitter  and Facebook. I'm always left in awe when I read that I've helped someone fight depression  help them during a bad phase in their life  stopped them from committing suicide  or if I've just made their day a little bit better.Nothing in the world is more amazing than to know that I've changed  inspired  and/or motivated a life.
