His parents reacted like normal people  and I don't blame them. They apologized to me and my mom  and everything's perfect now. Most of you may not know this  but Dhyaan and I met online. Dhyaan's father chose me for him  and that's why Dhyaan and I are together. His parents and I get along well  better than before  and we speak whenever possible. Because of this incident  the relationship between us has become stronger.I was very reluctant to share this story  because it makes Dhyaan's parents look bad  but they really aren't.
