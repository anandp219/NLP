I was sexually assaulted by one of the men there  so we stopped the treatment  after doing it for over five months. This treatment didn't yeild any positive effects  either.For the next two years  I underwent so many different treatments; you name it  I've done it. I also went to several astrologers/fortune tellers  because back then everyone kept saying that someone's done black magic on me  which I never believed. We spent so much money behind these treatments  astrologers  and fortune tellers.
