She was a wreck of emotions. Amy was sitting against the headboard of the bed  with her legs facing the door. I was sitting on the edge of the bed  with my legs hanging towards the floor. Suddenly  Amy tells me to come closer  because she wants a hug (she was too drunk to move). I shifted closer to her and gave her a hug  I told her everything would be alright.Amy pushed me and screams for a bucket because she was going to vomit. Well  me being the dumbass that I am  I didn't move becaus everyone was running around to get a bucket.
