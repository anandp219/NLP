Gradually  I learned how to breathe without a machine and they removed the trache after a month  which is really painful.Also  during the same time period  I realized I couldn't move my arms or legs. I was a vegetable. I would try to move my limbs  but I couldn't. I would put so much effort into my mobility that it emotionally and mentally drained me. Let me tell you something  we don't think about moving our muscles  they just work. When you're paralyzed  it's incredibly difficult. Try imaging this: You have sleep paralysis  and you're having a nightmare  but you can't move.
