  I started dating an Indian-African online almost two years ago.My boyfriend  Dhyaan and I started dating almost two years ago. I've done online dating before  but this was different. This guy was from Africa  from somewhere that I knew so less of. On top of that  it was online. Dhyaan could've been anyone he wanted to be and things could've ended badly  very badly.Surprisingly  he and his family are the most supportive  encouraging  caring  passionate  and loving people I have ever known (other than my own).
