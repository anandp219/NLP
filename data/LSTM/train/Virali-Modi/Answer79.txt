  After reaching fourty thousand followers  I expected to be stopped on the street  at the mall  or even interrupted during dinner by some of my followers. I mean  fourty thousand is a lot of people. Guess what? That never happened. Initially  I was upset. Not because people didn't recognize me  but because I could never hear people say the wonderful things I get to read in my Quora messages. I get the most beautiful messages from my followers which explains the direct or indirect effect I've had on their lives.
