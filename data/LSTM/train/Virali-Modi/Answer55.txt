  Even inspite of an arranged marriage  your wife picked you. It wasn't forced nor was was she blackmailed into marrying you. Your wife obviously saw something special in you that others couldn't recognize.Do me a favor  why don't you tell your wife everything you said in your description. Let us know what she says. I think she'll be angry at you. She'll be hurt that you think you deserve the mockery and that you're going along with it.Your colleagues have no right to judge your relationship  especially on your looks.
