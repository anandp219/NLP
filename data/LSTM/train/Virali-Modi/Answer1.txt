  To be honest  I haven't hidden anything from my parents. I realized  at a very young age  that my parents would be the only ones who'd take my side if the world was against me. They'd help me through anything if I told them the whole truth.At a young age I did hide things from my parents  and I paid a price. People were spreading rumors about me that weren't true and I didn't know what to do. It was mainly because I went to a party and had a little too much to drink. I was only fourteen years old and I was rebellious.
