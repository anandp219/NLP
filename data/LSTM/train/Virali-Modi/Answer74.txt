Of course  she doesn't listen to me.Amy finishes her second glass and starts complaining that she isn't even feeling a bit warm or high. She starts blaming the guys that they got her grape juice instead of wine  which in retrospect  I wish it was true. Quite quickly  she finishes one whole bottle of red wine. Then  she starts hitting people  laughing  shouting  screaming  and then crying. It was quite heartbreaking to see her release all of her suppressed emotions and anger.After seeing this  we cleaned up the hookahs and put it away  we started sitting around her  trying to calm her down  trying to make her laugh.
