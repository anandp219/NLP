Dhyaan wouldn't be home most of the day because he was still working during the three weeks when I was there (they distanced the music night/engagement  mehendi night  wedding  and reception into three weeks  so the guests coming from out of the country could stay around and go sightseeing).When Dhyaan would come home  he'd see me sitting all alone on the sofa  playing with my phone. His parents were also influenced  unfortunately  and were acting as if they didn't care. Keep in mind  this was my first time meeting them  they shouldn't have secluded me  but I don't blame them (I'll explain more later).
