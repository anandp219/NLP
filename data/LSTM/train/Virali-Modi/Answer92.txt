I'm getting better  and I haven't believed in any other treatment  more than I believe in this.I can definitely say that my treatments  the experiences I've had with other people  and the unfortunate events that I've been through has made my risk (moving to India) worthwhile. My health has greatly approved  I have over 43k followers on Quora  I'm gradually gaining fame  and one of my favorite directors (of Bollywood)  Mr. Nagesh Kukunoor tweeted about one of my newest written article  which has made me ecstatic!
