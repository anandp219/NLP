  I smile.Sure  it doesn't sound like much and I won't compare it to donating for good causes  but it's something that helps me feel better and it also affects other people  in a positive way. Smiling is a small gesture that doesn't cost anything  is effortless  and is actually really good for you.Personally  when I have a bad day and I don't feel happy or good about myself  a smile from a stranger really helps me. It's like an indirect messaging saying  "Keep holding on and being strong  you're doing just fine.
