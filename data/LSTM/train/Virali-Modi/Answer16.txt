I feel that in life  we go through struggles and hardships to prepare us for what's to come. We always end up doing what we're meant to  and the experiences we've had on the way  shape us for what we're truly meant to be. Usually  it's always better than what we dreamt of.I'm not sure if I really answered the question  I feel I've ventured off topic here  but I hope I made sense.
