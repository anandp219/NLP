  I'm going through this right now. I confronted one of my friends for being irrational and having a bad attitude. We aren't really  really close  but we were once upon a time. Well  now she and her friends (who are also my friends) have stopped talking to me  because supposedly  I hurt her ego.Yes  I was hurt and upset in the beginning  but I spoke to my mom and she told me to ignore them back  and to not even look at them when you're passing them on the street or see them anywhere. She said they'll automatically starting talking to me in some time  because you aren't affected by their behavior.
