Think of it this way; after getting in another relationship  you might not have the time or the resources to participate in different things because of a relationship. You have that time now! Go out there and do something different. These different experiences will help you grow and mature as a person.Look  if you don't want to do all that  then join a gym. Working out can do wonders for your emotional and pyshical health. A good physique can give you major confidence  and lifting heavy weights can be a good stress buster.
