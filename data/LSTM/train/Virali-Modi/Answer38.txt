That's when my dad called.Dad - "Beta  what happened last night? How much did you drink? "Me - (I told him the whole story) "Dad  I'm so sorry  I promise it won't happen again. Whatever he was saying was lies." (I kept going on and on)Dad - "It's okay  I believe you. Relax  it happens sometimes. You don't have to apologize as long as you've realized your mistake. A word of advice  dear: Don't trust anyone  especially if you're drinking. People will take advantage of the situation and they will manipulate words in order to make you look bad.
