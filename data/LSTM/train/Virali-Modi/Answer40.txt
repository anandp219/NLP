Yes  he'd always give me words of wisdom and would help me through issues  but my mom mostly raised me. My dad would always be the saviour whenever I was wrong. My mom has a bad temper  while my dad is really relaxed and cool headed. He's the one who'll calm my mom down  help me understand my mistake  and will look at a situation in a different prespective.
