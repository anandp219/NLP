  My boyfriend  Dhyaan  lives in Zimbabwe. I was fortunate to visit the country this year in May. I may not be able to give you an actual experience of how the country is and what it's like to live there  but from what I've noticed  during my month-long stay  I hope I'm able to paint a picture that's helpful.My boyfriend lives in Harare  the capital of Zimbabwe  I've noticed that they have to count each and every penny before spending. Dhyaan is a software engineer but works in a steel company as a seller and the head of IT.
