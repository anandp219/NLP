You really should believe that.I'll give you my example: When I came out of my coma and I realized I was paralyzed from the neck down  I seriously lost all hope. I didn't think life could get worse. I mean  I didn't have an education  I was a living corpse  I didn't have friends  nor did my immediate family care. I kept worrying about my future too.Then my dad told me something  "If you keep worrying ahout something that hasn't happened  how can you focus on what's happening right now? Stop being scared and do what you have to do.
