  Yes and no. It's a wordplay  and depending on how you phrase it  it can give an idea of the intent. To begin with  I'd like to point out statements like this aren't spoken in absolute isolationism  but rather with a relative reference. So when someone says Asians are good at math  they probably mean:Given a sample of scores in all math exams  the highest scoring ones consisted of many Asians OR given a sample of students in a higher-education math program  we're very likely to come across many Asians.
