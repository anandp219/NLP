What I mean is the Stonehenge in itself failed to overpower me and my friends as visitors  with it's sheer awesomeness. It was marvelous that I was seeing something so historic- stones which have been there for ages  whose origins are disputed- but if I hadn't known this- it could just have been some stones put in awesome formations. It looks exactly as it does in the pics  which is obvious but it lacks the grandeur beyond that. Although that might sound true of many other tourist attractions  it is not true for many as well.
