I know this is how it's supposed to be  but even in Goa it's not so easy to find peace for traveling as a Western tourist (at the least expect photo-ops).Con artists: Tuk-tuk drivers were expert con-artists  with lots of experience with ripping off tourists. Worse  they seem to have a network with stores  hotels  tourist sites  prostitutes and everything possible so when they're giving you very cheap rates someone else in the network is ripping you off big-time. Coming from India  this shouldn't shock me except I did get duped by one guy who duped me into paying 1500 baht for some Buddhist temples  which were less than 200 baht.
