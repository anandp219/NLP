  According to me  the beauty of the book lies not in the character of only Vito Corleone but the presence of the marginal character called Kay Adams- Michael's wife. She's not a prominent character  thus not making it a full-blown ethical debate. This image will help in the analysis of Vito's goodness: On one side we have the towering character of Vito Corleone who speaks of capitalism  hard-work  how all is he doing is out of necessity due to the government being crooks themselves. Using 'survival' argument of 'filling one's stomach'.
