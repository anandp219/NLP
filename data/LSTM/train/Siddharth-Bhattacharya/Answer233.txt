Wow  and that was a scary sight. This other bedroom had a small adjoining area (like a closet but much bigger)  where we used to store a lot of stuff. Books  clothes  shelf in addition to walking space. Guess what? Fire had engulfed this entire area. And it was flaming strong. What do you expect a 12-year old to do at this stage? Panic  of course. I started shouting to call Triya (as if it mattered). She came and we panicked together. Without much ideas  I started pouring water on the fire. In various installations-- size of small mugs (because we were too small to carry buckets).
