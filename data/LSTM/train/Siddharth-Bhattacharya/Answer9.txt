You need to do nothing. Confused? Ok  if you want I will write an algorithm: Stay curious Attend quizzes (both competitive/ non-competitive) Don't give up <repeat> That's it! Curious to know why it works? Here is the 'proof of correctness': Becoming a good quizmaster is at least as difficult as becoming a good quizzer. Quizzers are a very critical group & leave no stone unturned in ridiculing a bad question. Now- what's a bad question? Generally one requiring memorization.A good question is considered one whose final answer is something even non-quizzers would've heard of- say Gandhi or Obama.
