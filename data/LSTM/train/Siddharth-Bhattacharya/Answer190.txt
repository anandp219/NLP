Because no one cares- the youth has taken it's verdict on the man.Media anchors have their way of twisting the show so as to have the last laugh. Given Arnab Goswami (Journalist)'s demeanor  it was clear he wouldn't let him walk away pleasantly. So a damage-control tactic can possibly be to divulge as less as possible. Every word a prominent politician says is a door to a new controversy. In the current scenario what we have is jokes and memes on his intellect  but possibly if he had spoken more  Arnab could have twisted it putting questions on his credibility.
