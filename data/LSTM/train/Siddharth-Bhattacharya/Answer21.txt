In Churchill's case  no British leader ever had the extreme need to reduce his legacy by quoting his wrongdoings in the colonies. Indeed it would cost them lots of political points  as none of his major atrocities affected British populace who'd otherwise be thankful to him for winning the war. So his giant legacy (and will) remains.So why is Churchill celebrated? He is only celebrated by people of countries who benefited from his actions  is treated indifferently by many people around the globe who haven't heard his name and widely hated by people from countries who bore the brunt of his hostilities.
