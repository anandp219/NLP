Also Germany lost the war  so German leaders literally had the best deal by seeking progress in partnering with the winners and forgetting the leaders who brought shame of defeat. In Stalin's case  power struggles made Khrushchev denounce Stalin to reduce his personality cult [1]. I'll quote a modification of the oft-quoted "history is written by the victors". Every country writes it's own history  propagates it and shouts from the roof. The winners can afford to be the loudest. The losers often have power struggles in aftermath leading to either desecrating the legacy of their predecessors  or join hands with the winners in return of economic favors (and winners want positive attitudes towards themselves as a pre-condition for help  which can be achieved only by destroying cult around losing leader than by glorifying them as a martyr).
