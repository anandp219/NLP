However that doesn't mean it's not happening big time- it's just not obvious. There are too many adult entertainment options in Bangkok  Pattaya at least-- namely Go go bar  Ping pong show  Cabaret in strip clubs and so on. And of course  the Thai massage shops. With girls (?) shouting "massage" to passer-bys. I'm not sure how many of these operate as backdoor prostitution but the overall gist is- there is excessive adult entertainment without any legal brothels  although there are many girls standing alone by the beach who you can be sure are doing the same illegally.
