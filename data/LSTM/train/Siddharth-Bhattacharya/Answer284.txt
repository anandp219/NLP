This inevitably leads to the continuation of cycle of terror and ghettoization. Muslims without education will become ever more gullible to the radical agendas. Another worry iseven though it sounds like an exaggeration Islam faces a real threat of a genocide at least in some part of the world (most likely not state-sponsored  but "state-tolerated". The former will create a huge backlash and unification of Muslims)Unfortunately I don't see much hope for normalization of relations  as given the vast oil reserves in the Middle East (and thus the out-sized political influence it has) and a great location for trade routes and pipelines  the region will remain a center of attention for all world powers  be it US or China.
