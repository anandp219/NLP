Civilians were being killed by the Western armies thus increasing hatred and a stronger sense of identity as a result of the greater threat it faced. Meanwhile things kept getting muddled in violent cycles such as London bombings  2004 Madrid train bombings  death threats to Kurt Wustergaard  2008 Mumbai attacks and now Charlie Hebdo shooting. Given the decline and the constant search for identity  a large section of the Islamic society has found solace in their glorious history. This has led to further radicalization  rigid blasphemy laws and constant attempts to keep the religion afloat.
