There's a dark lord as well- Satan. Genesis 3:15.....He will bruise Satan's head.....Hebrews 2:14  1 			John 3:8So similar to Trelawney's prediction. What's more? It's fulfilled. Just like Harry Potter all these predictions can be treated by atheists as a work of fantasy. There's no reason to believe in the existence of either Jesus or Satan. All these sound like someone's fanciful imagination. And just like I said for Harry Potter- these prophecies & strange phenomenon need no explanation because we don't believe it's true.
