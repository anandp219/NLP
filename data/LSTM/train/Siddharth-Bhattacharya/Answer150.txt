  No one in the world knows the true meaning of our national anthem. The only person who did know (Rabindranath Tagore) died 72 years ago. [EDIT: The original question was 'How many Indians know the true meaning of our national anthem? followed by the same description as now]Having said that I knew the meaning you put up in the description from a long time. But remember at the end of the day this is just a theory. There exist various interpretations of our anthem- this is just one of them. What's true is it was sung when King George V and the queen visited India in 1911.
