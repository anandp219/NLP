  Meet this man: Morarji Desai  the 4th Prime Minister of India- the first of a non-Congress government as the leader of Janata Party. The only ideology uniting the members of the ruling party was an anti-Indira sentiment. Frustrated by the Emergency  having protested against it and probably incarcerated these revolutionaries meant a new progressive phase in Indian democracy  with no Congress  no corruption. Except he was deposed from within- by a member of his own party Charan Singh who replaced him to be the next Prime Minister.
