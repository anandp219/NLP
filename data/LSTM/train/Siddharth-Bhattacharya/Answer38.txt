  I have been there  done that. I have been on all sides of the fence: respect  disrespect  hatred to reverence and have discussed the topic with many.TL;DR Gandhi seems boring. An old man walking across the nation with a stick and preaching love  non-violence is not cool to a hot-blooded youth. A huge portion of our school literature  history is dedicated to Gandhi. His autobiography  chapters in literature on his Champaran protests to lessons in history about Swaraj  Quit India  Satyagraha. The way the teaching is imparted is not as what Gandhi was- a clever politician who made idealism pragmatic but as a saint who stood by his principles of love and peace.
