  Rose: How cold?Jack: Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over. You ever  uh  you ever been to Wisconsin?Rose: What?Jack: Well  they have some of the coldest winters around. I grew up there  near Chippewa Falls.....Anyway  I  uh  I fell through some thin ice; and I'm telling you  water that cold  like right down there...... it hits you like a thousand knives stabbing you all over your body. You can't breathe. You can't think. At least  not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in there after you.
