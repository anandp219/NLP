But the long period in between 800 AD- 1400 AD Islamic civilization was at the heart of developments in all fields. Its decline began in the early 12th century with the Mongol invasions by Genghis Khan (he was a Tengrist not a Muslim). Christian Crusades "won back" Spain and Sicily causing a blow to the centers of learning. The process intensified with Ottoman Empire's invasion of most Arab states  but the Ottoman's acceptance of Islam just shifted the center of power to Constantinople. Meanwhile the Mughal Empire was mighty in India during 15th-17th century  thus keeping few powers afloat.
