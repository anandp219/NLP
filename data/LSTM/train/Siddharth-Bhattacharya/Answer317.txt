I guess the best thing on my resume was an IEEE publication. I made it to onsite of all these companies + 3 more. Got offered a software developer position for MS Excel. Accepted it. Anyhow  the point is I am by no means coding in my sleep  nor have attempted any competitive programming ever. I'm as average as programmer can get. However I was pretty good on the mathematics side of things. Basically: if you can develop thinking process to reasonable level + learn how to code  it's manageable to get hired for these packages.
