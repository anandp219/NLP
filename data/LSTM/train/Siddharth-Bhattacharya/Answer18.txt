Every country champions it's leaders who helps improve their lives  often neglecting hardships or crimes inflicted on who we deem others. Especially winning wars does wonders to PR of leaders. Even mediocre ones. Compared to some of the above guys  Churchill has a decent CV. Defeated Nazi warlords in gruesome WW2  saved Jews & Poles indirectly  was the last PM to oversee the nostalgic British empire. For all his negatives in colonial empires  he didn't create them but was continuing a racist tradition created by his forefathers justifying "white man's burden".
