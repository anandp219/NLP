We were all alive although lots of our stuff was burnt down. I am not entirely sure of what followed as I wasn't old enough to handle the finances  but I guess there were insurance claims filed. Minor blame games continued for days between landlord  tenants and insurance folks on the cause of fire  and to this day the cause hasn't been established with certainty. There was a constant sense of fear amongst us after that. Looking back I think of what could have been: what if we'd also went along for shopping  what if we'd responded later  what if fire was stronger  what if pouring water had backfired-- there are so-many what ifs which could have changed our lives for much worse.
