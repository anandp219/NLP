  Traveling alone in a foreign country is like being in a love-affair relationship. It oscillates between extreme highs and extreme lows  with long-stable periods of in-between often including boredom. Except the relationship is with yourself. Traveling alone is an excellent way to get to know yourself.Before delving into explaining  I'd state my personal experience. I've traveled alone in Netherlands  Belgium  Thailand and UK for about 5 months combined- all of it wasn't travel- and once in Bhutan.
