There's poverty everywhere. These people face misery everyday in their lives. What still keeps them going? Where do they get the hope from? What prevents them from robbing banks  stealing other's share of the pie because after all they are compelled to do so? It's this God. There's indeed magic in this concept. To wretched lives  words of hope sound like empty vessels. There's all the temptation to leave the moral  ethical path of working harder and get involved in illegal businesses- smuggling  theft.
