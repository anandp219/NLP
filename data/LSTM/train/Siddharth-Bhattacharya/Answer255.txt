And there was no negative chanting for either  so it remained a great experience. Another thing worth mentioning is the Mexican wave (which was interestingly started by just one person in my next lot rousing the whole crowds). When I'd seen football & volleyball live  the broadcasters encouraged us to keep going. Here as match isn't supposed to go on with noise  the chair umpire let few rounds of wave proceed and causing it to slowly fizzle by stern command like "thanks audience  time or match to resume".
