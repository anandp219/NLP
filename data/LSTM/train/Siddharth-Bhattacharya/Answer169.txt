Of course as I said  this doesn't mean they are indeed the best companies to work for in terms of satisfaction  career growth  individual impact  bureaucracy  perks etc (although even in worst case  they're pretty good in all the metrics). Those things vary for every individual  and can be rationalized. But the obsession as asked in the question isn't a very rational feeling and that's why most people would jump at a job-offer from these companies (as a developer at least) irrespective of whether it will be the "best work" in terms of learning or even long-term monetary maximization.Ending on a positive note  I finally have been able to fulfill my obsession.
