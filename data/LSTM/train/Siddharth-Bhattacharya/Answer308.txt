With an initial introduction of some work you've done- a project with some questions like "what would you have done differently"  "challenges" and suchlike the interviewer proceeds to do a "technical question". This is typically a question based on data structures/ algorithms and you're required to write code on the white-board while explaining what you're writing. Code needn't be syntactically perfect  but it's good to be as close as possible. You can find most of these questions online  and with enough practice (1-2 months) new questions won't be too challenging as well.
