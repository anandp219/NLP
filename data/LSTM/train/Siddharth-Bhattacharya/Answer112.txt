So the governments go to great lengths to preserve & instill patriotism- championing history  culture and fostering unity through even sports. So it's not in the best interests of society to let go of patriotism and people in power therefore ensure it's "a widely celebrated form of identity affirmation".Should you question patriotism like other constructs? By all means  Yes. The problem is obviously in the assumption of the head of society who wants only societal progress. Reality is not so idealistic.
