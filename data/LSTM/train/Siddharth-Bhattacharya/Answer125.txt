Harry Potter is a creation of JK Rowling- her world of fantasies where all this stuff is possible. It needs no explanation because it's not true in the real-world. Coming to the accurate prophecies apart from the magic  there's also the element of Self-fulfilling prophecy there. If Voldemort never heard of the prophecy  he wouldn't have gone after the Potters- which wouldn't have led to Lily Potter's protective shield and so on. Coming to the Messianic prophecies. Jesus does unbelievable stuff while others can't- he heals people  becomes the redeemer.
