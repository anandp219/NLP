Holden is a negation of the existing societal phenomenon. He represents what's wrong with the society. But as an alternative  he is hollow. He is full of contradictions. He leaves his home  but doesn't know for what. He praises his Professor endlessly  goes to his home and flees away. He can see negative shades in every character apart from his younger sister 'old Phoebe'. Holden's protest against the status quo seems more just for the sake of it than leading anywhere. Holden symbolizes confused youth- rebels without a cause.
