Now that we've agreed  our eyes go towards such news more often. Despite the dismal environment  it may represent a minor ray of hope. Finally women can come out of their suppressed closets and report cases of harassment. Moreover the media has been able to stimulate the consciousness of society for once towards a real pressing issue. So the bottomline is - rapes always occured in huge numbers  it's one of the most pressing issues of our times  the fact that we're seeing them reported more often is probably a sign of hope as media is finally reporting it- successfully catching the attention of our eyeballs.
