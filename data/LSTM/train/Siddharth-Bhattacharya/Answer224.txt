There are ropes put around it  and visitors are not supposed to cross it. Also you can see the Stonehenge from some distance  and entering beyond it you have to pay (I think it was  7). Given these two things  I felt there wasn't an extreme difference in the experience whether one pays to enter or not. The major difference is you can look at from a little closer  they provide an audio device on which you can listen to the history of the stones and of course you can get some pictures from close-up.
