No. However what the average Muslim probably shares is disillusionment of the West as well as following rigid religious practices such as believing The Quran to be a holy book from Allah to be followed in word and spirit (pretty similar to Christianity and the Bible  except Christian countries right now dominate the world. Possibly in a few hundred years  Christianity will take Islam's violent place after being marginalized by atheism). The average Muslim also probably shares concern regarding the waning sense of Muslim identity.
