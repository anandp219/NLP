Considering the society we live in- where violence is sometimes forbidden and otherwise glorified and women are seen as inferior; odds are me or you could be a rapist. Yes  it's true. Unless we tame the devil within ourselves. Unless we remove that part of the society from ourselves which let the criminal commit the crime- in this case  our inclination to violence and disrespect for women we could've been him. (Image: We need teamwork as a society  not blame games)Changing mindset is a long task and one of the best ways to begin is- rather than pointing fingers  passing on the blame & denying our role in creating the monstrous society; take a moment to look within ourselves & purge that part of ourselves which has contributed to the crimes.
