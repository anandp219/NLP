If someone can use the movie as evidence that we need to increase funding for NASA  take action against climate change there's also enough scenes to give evidence that scientists are petty scheming creatures (wrestling on other planets) and don't deserve anything more. So if you've decided to watch Interstellar (I strongly recommend to form independent opinions + fwiw  it brings science into public consciousness)  prepare yourself for some great visual effects and seeing American flag on more planets for the next 3 hours of your life.
