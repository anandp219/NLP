Companies like Infosys  TCS  Wipro send few of their employees every year at their US/UK offices to fill in roles. Alternately after few years of experience (3-5) post your resume on Dice.com. Lots of body shops hang around on that website  and offer "contract positions". Their target market is OPT-candidates as well as Indian employees with few years IT experience on some platforms who are desperate to come to US. Most of them won't be in Valley. However once you've entered US on a H1B  it's much easier to get a H1B transfer than going through lottery from India.
