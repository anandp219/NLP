  I'm very fond memories from the first time I met a Nobel Laureate. Not only did I get to see him  I got a long one-on-one conversation with the winner of Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001. It was November 2011. ContextProfessor Stiglitz was giving a talk at Indian Statistical Institute  Delhi on the market imperfections leading to financial crisis in 2008. Even though I didn't study there  I was invited because I sat through an entire "Introduction to Game Theory" course. The attendance was only 50-60 and it was a small classroom  so we could all easily see and hear him.The Lecture and ConversationGiven his left-leanings it naturally had elements of it.
