The choice of someone who has an untarnished reputation (at least for sometime) serves as a good inspiration for others to follow.5) Role Model: This is an extension of the previous points  but seeing a homegrown Indian win international acclaim of the highest order will inspire many others to take up righteous causes. In particular  NGOs in India face shortage of funds  respect  recognition. With Kailash's success  we can expect others to take up the mantle with more confidence. 6) Child abuse as an evil: Fighting for children's rights is very important  and it's essential this evil be exposed to highlight international attention as well as local attention with the governing class  so that Modi can probably tag in children's empowerment alongside programs like Swacch Bharat campaign.
