But in the end  those what-ifs didn't happen. I am alive  so is Triya. And I'm thankful to everyone who saved our lives for that. We could've cursed our fate for the fire in the first place  but rather thankfully we focused on the positive side. As the Hindi saying goes: jaan bachi to laakho paaye (lives saved are worth more than millions).
