Watch more. Like sports? See more. Don't like politics? No need to explore it. Let it remain a fun activity rather than making it resemble coursework. Personal story: In my college (IIT-Delhi) there is a strong MELA (music-entertainment- literature- arts) culture in quizzes with the inherent assumption everyone likes watching movies/ listening to rock music etc. However I rarely see movies/series. As a result I suffered badly unable to clear prelims for a long time. It demotivated me and I quit quizzing for a long time.
