Where does subsidy go? It's also worth noting where these subsidies are invested. A major bulk of the subsidies are invested in fields such as engineering  sciences (considered high-skill labour). However within these institutions only a small fraction of the investment is towards subsidizing student's fees. A better picture would be obtained if one considers these educational institutions (examples- IITs) as merely research labs  where the scientists also dedicate a part of their time teaching students  who in turn pay for this imparted education.
