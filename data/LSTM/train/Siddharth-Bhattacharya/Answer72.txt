Nevertheless that's it about Bieber: I can speak of similar pop music (Pitbull etc). Composition: Artists like Bieber are primarily vocalists. Someone else writes the song  composes music  plays it- the artist just sings. On the contrary  the Beatles did everything on their own from composing  writing the lyrics to playing instruments. Well  Bieber is alone while they were 4  right? Eric Clapton did it all alone. Music: Most of the pop songs have indistinguishable music- precise same beats. You take out the voice  all are almost the same.
