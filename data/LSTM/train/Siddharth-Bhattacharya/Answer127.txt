Just like Rowling's writing Harry Potter doesn't make it true  writing Bible (by an anonymous author) doesn't make it true. Nevertheless there are some excellent moral insights in Harry Potter which don't need the advent of a God. Bible can be treated the same way- take away the morals  chuck the junk.
