Sometimes backdoor negotiations with multiple offers can increase it slightly. However the taxes are much higher than India. In states like California  there is a state tax of ~ 9.5% (thankfully it's 0% in Washington) bumping the taxes to > $30 000 annually. Also cost-of-living is way higher. The post-tax annual salary is around Rs. 35 lakh (if directly converted) which is much lesser than dream figure of Rs 1 crore +. I'm not saying all this because I get lower (I don't) and therefore am trying to pull them down.
