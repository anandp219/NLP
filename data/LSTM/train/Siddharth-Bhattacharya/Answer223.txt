  I visited Stonehenge twice in a very short period of 15 days. The first time it was a touristy endeavor with 2 of my friends. The latter time it was a spontaneous decision to go there  as I found about Stonehenge summer solstice festival just a day before the event. So I will mention in brief on both- a usual visit  as well as the special occasion of Solstice  which is annual celebration in June around 20th-21st. Visiting as a touristAn important thing worth knowing is you can't touch the stones  or get super close.
