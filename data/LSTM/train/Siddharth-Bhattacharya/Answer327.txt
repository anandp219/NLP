It works mainly when audience doesn't have a thorough understanding of logical principles. Such people are afraid to disbelieve arguments using "logically it follows" repeatedly out of the fear of being deemed illogical.Some examples of such statements are ones using the word "necessary"  "obviously"  "of course" without evidence: "We have no option left and it's necessary we go to war." [1]"Obviously God doesn't exist  else we would have seen him till now". [2]"Of course God wanted humans to be heterosexuals".
