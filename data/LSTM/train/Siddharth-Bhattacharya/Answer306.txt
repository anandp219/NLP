The most common way is to get referred by a company insider (friend/ex-colleague). Have a good resume  with 1-2 internships at least  something noteworthy and there's a very good chance of hearing back from some member of their HR department. Frankly  I've had almost zero luck in posting my resume on careers@x.com so I would be fooling anyone by recommending that. It might work  but isn't great for beginner levels. However I've to admit that I don't know more of the protocol from "non-premier institutes" although I've lots of peers who are from them  mostly via Master's route.
