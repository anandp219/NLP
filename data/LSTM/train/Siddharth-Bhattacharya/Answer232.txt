  It was 24th November  2002.I was 12 years old and Triya was 10. Our parents had gone shopping/ buying groceries a few miles away while we'd refused to come along since we were watching Harry Potter. So while Harry and Voldemort battled it out  I realized smoke filling the bathroom in front of us. Initially it didn't seem very important as we reasoned it to be hot water fumes from the geyser. However when few moments later fumes kept increasing I decided to go and check the bedroom on the other side of the bathroom.
