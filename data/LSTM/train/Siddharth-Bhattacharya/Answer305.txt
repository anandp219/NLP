It's a pretty enumerative list of how to get noticed by these big companies. For on-campus placements  the usual way of shortlisting is two-fold with filtering students based on GPA cutoff  and then conducting a coding exam. There are generally 2-3 coding questions requiring compilation  alongside few objective questions. Ones with best solutions (compiles quickly  no errors  few warnings  passes most test cases) make the interview. Outside of campus  as mentioned in other answer some ways to get noticed are HackerRank  Github contributions etc.
