It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's  who is  in this critic's opinion  nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau's soon  hungry for more.I am not a fan of animated movies  but this one and Wall-E really captured my imagination.EDIT: As pointed out by Jared Gores  it's not the last line of the movie. I have nevertheless knowingly included it considering it's the last sequence.
