This leads to an excessive supply of labour  leading to underpaid labour or high-unemployment. (unemployment is among worst maladies for government  as a productive but frustrated youth can easily be inclined to anti-social activities). (I don't necessarily advocate what the placard says)Higher costs of tertiary education- even amongst relatively well off- makes children dependent on their parents for the fees. In the West  it's considered good practice to forsake dependence at about 18 and higher costs of education definitely won't help there.
