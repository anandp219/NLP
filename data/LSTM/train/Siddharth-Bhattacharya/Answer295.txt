"Take a left  you'll see a 7-Eleven. Keep walking straight  you will see another. Turn right from there". So on. Obsession with white: Before going to Thailand  I didn't know their skin-color has a tan. However there are TV's with intense melodrama being played a lot  and all the characters are extremely fair. One (Thai) girl I met lamented her darker skin  but was happy she was dating a white guy (British). So I learnt this trend isn't exclusive to India.Conservatism vs liberalism: I know this can be different amongst Thais vs what is allowed for foreigners  but the overall idea is Thais show perfect respect for whatever foreigners do amongst themselves even if it may not agree with their traditional values.
