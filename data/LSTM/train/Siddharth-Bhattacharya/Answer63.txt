  Treat it as an entertainment movie where 'Murica saves the world yet again and you'll find it an entertaining watch. Like A Day After Tomorrow  Godzilla etc. One where scientists (and ex-pilots) "save humanity from destruction" (get used to this phrase  they'll use it so often it might make your head swirl). Of course destruction of humanity refers to some random American 'burb facing some climatic problems. Don't focus too much on the science part of it: either accuracy or even understanding whatever they're saying.
