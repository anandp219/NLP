Our neighbours are pretty loud-mouthed as well. So on being seen by an acquaintance along with a girl  news will definitely reach the family in subtler forms indicating "child is slipping out of control".When through "such sources" news reaches family ears  they realize they must rush & start finding brides/grooms for their child. Unable to fight with their parents  the children have to break-up with their partners thus disappointing the relationship & get married elsewhere. Since relationships before marriage is a new concept India is grappling with  relationships necessarily mean marriage for even the children.
