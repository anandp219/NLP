He is an embodiment of the existential crisis  teens and adolescents go through. Through one character Sallinger is able to represent two very powerful and opposite things- what the 'mature adults' in the society do wrong and how young rebels who consider themselves unfit are unable to make any significant dents or offer any significant alternatives. Holden Caufield is an embodiment of the quote: "Every generation considers itself more intelligent than the previous one and wiser than the one about to come".This makes Holden such a compelling character.
