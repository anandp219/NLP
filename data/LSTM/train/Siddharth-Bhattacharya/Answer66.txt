However  keeping with her role and Jessica Chastain's the movie does pass the Bechdel test comfortably  so you can go to feel empowered (although if that was my aim  I'd prefer watching Frozen).Matthew McConnaughley is an impressive actor  and he performs as nicely as script allows him to. So his acting shouldn't be the biggest of your worries. Also be prepared for some insignificant cameos from some forgotten actors (in Robert Frost's words: "weird American Beauty kid") and some famous stars with planets named after them.
