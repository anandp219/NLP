  Nothing exists in a vacuum. In the aftermath of Attack on French Magazine Charlie Hebdo  I'd take an occasion to explain rise and fall of Islam and relevance it holds in contemporary Islamic terrorism.TL; DR Islam is a civilization in decline  albeit a great one in the past  and its adherents have a tough identity crisis to deal with in the face its continuous decline. Not knowing where to look for a sense of identity and hope  they are often susceptible to fundamentalism and the belief that they can regain past glory.This question is asked by many people every day  and the answers on both sides are often either No true Scotsman saying "only some Muslims do it" while others point out "even if not all Muslims are terrorists  all terrorists seem to be Muslim".
