One such community with the largest Quora population is- Indians. Let me give some reasons why this can a very valid concern: Questions such as "Which is the best X?" receive many answers which Indians can mainly relate to. Examples- related to Rahul Gandhi  NaMo  Bollywood movies and suchlike. Not all the answers come with excellent explanations of describing the choice to an outsider. As a net result  for a foreigner the whole experience can be baffling. (Picture: memes on them can be very confusing for outsiders)The demographics of Indian Quora is largely comprised of college students or young people in their early 20s.
