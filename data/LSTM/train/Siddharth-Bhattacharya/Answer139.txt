Today I can afford Mac  iPhone etc but a year back in college I wouldn't have been able (except by incurring huge debt which I wasn't willing to) which means most of my life I've used primarily Windows. So now that we've established a large section of "people who can afford Macs" grew up on Windows due to cost/ whatever reasons  let's see why we don't migrate to Mac on getting money. The few times I'd to use a Mac I discovered there was a non-trivial learning curve. So essentially in order to start using Macs  I'd have to invest time  energy and (significantly more) money.
