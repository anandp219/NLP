What traveling alone does is it makes us desperate for companions. Which sounds scary  but as a result it offers us the opportunity to interact with people we may never had due to being busy with our own peers. And with meeting new people comes the excitement of getting to know the local culture  traditions and make new friends. Part of the excitement of making new friends is knowing you won't see them again most likely. As a result  you can be as silly and honest as you want without thinking a lot on judgment.
