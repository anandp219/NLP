The incremental benefit I get out of making this switch is not worth it in my opinion. I get a cooler interface  sexier way to navigate  sleek body and possibly an entry into the "Apple users" club. I don't need any of it badly  thanks a lot or there are ways to get it with lesser investment. An important thing to remember is the use cases. As a low-end (or not high-end user)  the typical tasks I'd use my machine is for-- browsing the internet  listening to music  occasionally playing games/watching movies.
