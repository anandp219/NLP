Practice some of the common algorithms by writing code for them. Have a package for each of the common data structures in your local machine in any language of your choice (preferable if it is C/ C++ / C# /Java/ Python). Write working code for standard algorithms for each of these- for example  for binary trees  write working methods for tree traversal algorithms  try various inputs and see it works as expected. For linked lists  write code to reverse it; for graphs  traversal such as BFS  DFS as well as Djikstra's.
