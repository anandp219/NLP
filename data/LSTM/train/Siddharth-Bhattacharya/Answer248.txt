Even Hitler had them". The acceptance of Hitler as a moral objective "bad" makes it tempting for people arguing to draw equivalences between their opponent (or their viewpoint) to Nazis thus proving it's wrong. Why is that bad? It kills the symbol. If anything and everything can be compared to Hitler (Nazis) it's not such a bad act after all. Hitler becomes our video game villian  the one we want to throw tomatoes at to vent out. And that's the symbolism getting lost - history functions to preserve the lesson learnt through Hitler rather than making him a pedestrian bad guy to vent our frustrations on.
