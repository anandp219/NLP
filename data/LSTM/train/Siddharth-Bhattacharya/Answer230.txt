It's a site in the middle of nowhere. When I went in the bus  I had to get down 30-40 minutes walking distance away from the site. (at Amesbury- on a X5 from Oxford) While returning  I took a train from Salisbury but it's like 10-20 minutes by taxi to Salisbury. The worse part is we'd to walk like 2-3 miles in excessive rain to find a taxi. So if you don't have a car (and in UK  that's not as big a surprise as not having one in US) it is going to be kind of hassle  especially in rains (which is almost every second day in UK).
