As just mentioned  one person decided it's not for him to assume any consent regarding the video at all. I thought that the male actor was a stand-in for me and other viewers. In that light  we had the consent to watch the video  only up to the point where the sex was consensual. This emphasizes the "ongoing" aspect in the definition of consent. If she is telling the man to stop  has consent ended for us as well? Should we watch no further? If we keep going to see the man keep going  isn't that a violation?The act of us viewing this video is a stand-in for the role the public-at-large plays in the life of a rape victim in the days and weeks and months forward.
