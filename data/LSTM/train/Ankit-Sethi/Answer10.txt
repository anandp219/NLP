  The show was unknown to the general public and it made sense for the pilot to be a bold grab at people's attention.If you're on the fence about watching a pilot  but then you learn that the episode description goes: "Terrorists kidnap royalty and demand the British PM have sex with a pig"  you are going to watch that show. That's good TV right there.I think also that National Anthem aspired at broader commentary compared with the focused studies on death  memory or justice  that characterize the later episodes.
