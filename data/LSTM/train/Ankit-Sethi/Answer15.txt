  Could there BE anything cooler than the idea of a BasqueIcelandic pidgin?In roughly the 17th century  as the Basques were exploring the Atlantic for fishing opportunities  they found their way to Iceland  another place where they had no common language. Actually  the Basque-Icelandic pidgin is a complex mix of a number of languages that these two disparate groups of people used to communicate. Interestingly  the Icelanders documented this pidgin and the Basque-Icelandic glossaries are now online for all to browse.Apparently  the Basques had a long history in Iceland  essentially competing with the locals for fishing resources.
