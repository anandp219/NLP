  The most prominent example of such a feud on TV right now is between Julianna Marguiles and Archie Punjabi on The Good Wife. The friendship between the two women characters was one the big draws of the show in the early seasons. Speculation has been rife since season 5 when they suddenly stopped appearing in scenes together  appeared to talk only through phone calls and kept "missing" each other though they worked in the same office.Though the conversations about the feud are unfounded speculations  the actors and producers of the show have pointedly deferred answering the question  suggesting that there are some difficulties.
