When forced to spend the night with them  Junpei Niki is led by the villagers to the hospitality of a woman living in a house built inside a sand quarry. Lowered down by rope ladder and offered food and care by the woman inside  he settles down to sleep through the first of many years worth of nights in that house. For the hospitality was a ruse - the villagers have assigned the woman  and now him  the Sisyphean task of endlessly digging up sand and piling it into the waiting buckets of the villagers above.
