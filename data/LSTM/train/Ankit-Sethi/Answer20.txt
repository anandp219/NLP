The movie charts Daniel Plainview's rise to the apex of the oil business and transform into a frankly terrifying titan of American-brand frontier capitalism  while Paul Dano in a breakout role as Eli Sunday is constant fly in the ointment as a preacher of a local community who senses in Daniel Plainview's ambition  an opportunity to parlay the fervor of his community's faith into a piece of the Plainview pie. Over a gripping two and a half hour hours  what ensues is an allegorical struggle between capitalism and religion.
