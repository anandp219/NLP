Whenever a capitalist entity advocates for feminism  one can always expect it to enlist it in service of their capitalist agenda  and I believe it's important to be aware of that.The second problem I would mention is that it erases the experiences of many women who might simply have no choice in the matter of what size they are. There is a breeziness in the manner at which the choice of size is presented  as if it shifting from one end to another were a matter of dieting and exercise when many women might have have very real hindrances to ever achieving their ideal size.
