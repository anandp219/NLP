In such societies  if people are okay with non-consensually killing animals but not okay with non-consensually having sex with them  then that's a clear double standard.In however  say  a remote Inuit settlement that is critically dependent on hunting for survival  it would not be a double standard for them to eat meat and yet keep bestiality outlawed. The non-consensual killing would be necessary and hence not a moral wrong while the bestiality (non-consensual by definition) would still be wrong since it cannot be a necessity.
