  A Google Scholar/Google News search shows the phrase showing up in geographic contexts of countries such as Nigeria  Congo  Turkey  India  South Africa as well as contexts depending on membership in a social group such as the "epidemics" of campus rape  male rape  child rape etc.It's hard to definitively say that application of this term for India is especially unjustified. The word is simply very catchy. American news media tends to be an equal opportunity offender  and India is temporarily getting more of the attention than the rest.I would not directly compare the usage of "rape culture" and "rape epidemic" directly since a) "rape culture" is a holistic 360 feminist theory of social behaviors and mindsets that make sexual violence thrive; while b) "rape epidemic" is more of a numbers game.
