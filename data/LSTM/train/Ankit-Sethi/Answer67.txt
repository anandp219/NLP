  Great answers here. One other point I would add is that movie critics have seen a lot more movies than the average movie-goer  even most cinephiles. Not only is their depth of experience with film greater  but also they've consciously worked on widening their palette to appreciate films of diverse and international genres and film traditions. This places them in the unique position of being able to connect the dots and see a bigger picture (no pun intended) which they share with interested audiences through their writing.Here's a couple of examples - Rome  Open City (Roberto Rossellini  1945)   La Dolce Vita (Federico Fellini  1960)  and  La Grande Bellezza (Paolo Sorrentino  2013) are three Italian films by different directors set in different decades and filmed in different styles.
