For me  my desire to keep watching the video equated  in some sense  to the male participant's desire to disregard her pleas for him to stop. Part of this I also read to be an implicit equating of audience and participant. When I think of how easy it was for me to keep watching  I feel drawn to understand that the male participant also viewed her in the same passive  objectifying manner  as entertainment on a screen  and the end conclusion of this line of thinking being that violation of consent happens when objectification sabotages conscious participation and turns it into spectacle.Lastly  I would make a aesthetic note about the 4 camera setup.
