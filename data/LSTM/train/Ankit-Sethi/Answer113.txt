Taking it not quite literally  as a metaphor for the sexual violence the public at large allows by not trusting the lived experiences of women  the intercourse feels a bit like a challenge or a test. She says she wants us to not be part of her rape. By asking us to set a boundary for ourselves  she wants us to state a line that we will not cross  after what point we would say that we too as spectators contributed to the crime. This is especially resonant in the wake of The Fappening/iPhone photo leak.
