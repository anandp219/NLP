  First of all  he did not get "molested." Invoking such language is uncalled for.A few blog posts and tweets that were highly critical of him recently saw some popularity. His recent quotes in the Newsweek cover story got much coverage and also appear to been instrumental in setting up the spotlight that now bears down on him. The sentiment I got from feminists/women in tech about these criticisms seems to be one of "thank god someone finally said this"  i.e. a feeling long left unarticulated had finally been expressed.For details on what specific criticisms feminists have levied against him  you can see: Quiet  Ladies.
