The defendant was quite likely not informed about the legal repercussions of this video recording  and it can be contended that it was the State's responsibility to do so since he is in the custody of the State. There is a set and fairly rigid procedure under which a confession may be taken and acted upon in legal proceedings  and if this video were to affect either the defendant's appeals process or the mercy petitions eventually written on his behalf  it can be argued that those set procedures have effectively been bypassed by the State.
