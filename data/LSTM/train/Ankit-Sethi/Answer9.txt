They get to have their cake and eat it too  violating his right to due process.Making the reasonable assumption that it is unrealistic to expect a firewall between this highly publicized documentary and the officers of the court involved in his case  it would be correct to stop the release of this documentary until his role in the judicial process is complete. I believe in this not just because I'm a stickler for rules and procedures  but I believe that a fair and just legal system that can be relied upon for recourse does far more for creating a safe environment for all its citizens than any change a documentary may or may not bring about.
