A final image from the scene informs us that Junpei has been missing for over seven years. As becomes clear over the course of the story  Woman in the Dunes is a sometimes-harrowing allegory about life  what we consider to be meaningful  and how oppressive agents and forces of nature beyond our control shape our destiny. While this may sound quite disheartening  the movie offers us at the end a vision for hope - offered freedom from his prison  Junpei rejects it for a chance to keep working on the novel device he discovered.
