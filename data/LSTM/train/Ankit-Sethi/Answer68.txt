But what movie critics see is that the three films each manage to capture particular  temporary  and very compelling moments in the cultural history of Rome  and taken together form a historical trilogy of sorts; On a similar note  Persona (Ingmar Bergman  1966)  3 Women (Robert Altman  1977)  and Mulholland Drive (David Lynch  2001) form a triptych on the common theme of feminine identity.Being able to illuminate this meta-narrative for the benefit of filmgoers who can't spend the same amount of time on casual entertainment  is one of the most unique services a film critic can provide.
