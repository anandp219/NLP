From a metaphysical point of view  Russia and America are the same  with the same dreary technological frenzy and the same unrestricted organization of the average man.But Heidegger believed that Russian Bolshevism was only a variant of Americanism and considered Russia less of a problem than America because there could at least be dialogue with Marxists since they had a sense of history  while America had none. What was essentially going on was that several strands of thought that were threatened by everything commodified and mass produced wanted to create an anti-technological agenda but since "technology" was not enough of a real thing for people to hate  seized upon the idea of America as a symbol for everything that's wrong about where progress was taking us.
