Throughout the Cold War  Indonesia was publicly neutral but privately aligned with the US. Suharto had a strong anti-Communist agenda and the Russians even had an arms embargo against the country. So there are at least a few decades of positive foreign policy relations behind the scenes there. Indonesia was also a founding member of the regional collective ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). It also keeps bearing in mind that Indonesia grew massively under Suharto to become a strong regional power and given how close it is to China  the US and Indonesia have good reasons to continue to cooperate  specifically on their mutual goal of containing China's influence.
