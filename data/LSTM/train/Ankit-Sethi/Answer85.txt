(**)To sum it up  Indonesia's past and (then) present alignments on foreign policy probably helped ensure that their President got a state dinner. The only confusing bit is that if you go by the year the episode is set in  President "Sugardo" should already have been thrown out of office. (*) - I'll regard Donna's throwaway line "they summarily execute people they suspect of being sorcerers" as a bit of dime-store orientalism. (**) - For a post 9/11 episode  there would be the additional factor that Indonesia has the world's largest population of Muslim people  a population that is tolerant and pluralistic  and that holding up such a role model is just good diplomacy for an America trying to promote democracy in the Middle East.
