If one were to be inclined to distill these various interpretations to their quintessence - in modern life  the thing that fucks you up and the thing that's trying to fix your life afterwards are often in cahoots. Not getting into such barebones though  the allegorical interpretation that makes most sense to me is that Upstream Color is about Capitalism (the "Thief" in the movie) --- in the sense of a process that you cannot help but participate in (The "Thief" literally controls the bodies of his victims and forces them to perform idiosyncratic tasks for days before emptying their bank accounts and discarding them) --- dovetailing itself with a Higher Deity (The "Sampler" in the movie  who later beckons victims of the "Thief" and removes the mind-control worm from the body)  to ensure that a cycle of fear  dependence and violence perpetuates itself  to the profit of both parties.There Will Be Blood by Paul Thomas Anderson - There Will Be Blood is the sort of movie begging to be called a saga.
