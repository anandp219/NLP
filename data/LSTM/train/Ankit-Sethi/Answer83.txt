  This is not addressed in the episode exactly  but the Indonesian leader (Sugardo) in the episode seems to be clearly modeled on Suharto  the controversial Indonesian President who held office from '67 to '98.At the time the episode was written  Suharto would have been very recently ousted from a 31 year long stint in power marked towards the end by violence  nepotism  corruption and pandering to Islamism  so the references to political oppression are timely and appropriate. (*)That bring us to the state dinner and what Indonesia did to deserve it.
