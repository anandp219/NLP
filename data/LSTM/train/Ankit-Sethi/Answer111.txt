If she made it willingly and uploaded it on her personal website for (potential) public viewing  does it still mean all of us have a right to view it? (compare with 'even if she's naked she's not asking for it...') At least one person said that the text on her website in sum meant that he did not feel she had consented to have him watching her video and so he was not going to. Instead he emailed her to ask if he could watch it. I count that as a genuine example of engagement and a specific human response to the art piece  though it need not be how all of us react to it.
