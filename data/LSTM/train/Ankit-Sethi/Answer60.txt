To get down to brass tacks  no one is talking about the the generations of women in their 30  40s and 50s who are stuck in acrimonious loveless marriages. Marriages which might be violent or marriages where the spouse might just be sexually distant and unavailable (or simply philandering with the maid). Where the couple might not have had sex since their last child was conceived  which might have been a decade ago. Or even widows who are now expected to be sexless and partner-less the rest of their lives since their children are grown up and settled and why  after all  would a woman want sex at that stage?
