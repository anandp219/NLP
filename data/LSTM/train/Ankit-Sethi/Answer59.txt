If a percentage of men can be assholes  so should a percentage of women  if they so desire. So I don't like the idea of preaching to women against adultery. And if you say your plea was gender neutral  then duh  everyone already knows it's a bad thing to do  see point 1.they shut down any measured discussion of the sheer variety of sexual relationships found inside Indian marriages. This is a subject that is hardly focused upon. Open marriages are one example that other people have perhaps mentioned but are likely to be a minority.
