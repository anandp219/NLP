  The male penis swells inside the female's vagina during the mating  causing them to get virtually locked. It is absolutely normal phenomenon. They might be locked for some good 15-20 minutes during which ejaculation takes place. One should not attempt to separate them  to allow successful mating. A small bone is found inside the dog's penis called baculum that holds the penis while attempting penetration. Once the penis has reached inside the vagina  the bulbus glandis (found at base of penis) will start to congest with blood and swells  to eventually lock the mating couple.
