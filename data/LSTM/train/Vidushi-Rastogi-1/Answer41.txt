  Dogs are very friendly creatures. They would bite only if one is an asshole or stupid. (Sorry for language but it came with personal observation).Dog might love you. But your current status is that of stranger. Don't try to touch it straightaway. And never try to touch if it is growling  barking  tail straight up or in stiff posture or showing signs of discomfort like repeated lip licking. If dog is not having any such sign you are good to go.Squat near the dog if it is not an aggressive breed.
