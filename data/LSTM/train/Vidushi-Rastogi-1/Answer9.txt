Immune therapies targeting GAD65 and Insulin have been tested in both animal models and in human T1D patients. Presence of a mucosal adjuvant or carrier molecule is required for enhancement of oral tolerance. Cholera Toxin Subunit B (CTB) has been shown to promote immunological tolerance against certain types of mucosally co-administered antigens  preferably tissue antigens linked to the CTB molecule. Cholera Toxin (CT) is made up of two types of subunits; subunit A being toxic and embedded in circular homopentamer of subunit B.
