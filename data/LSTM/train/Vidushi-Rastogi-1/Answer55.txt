  Curious question it is.A pessimist me would say that 'many' might deem you unfit for nuptial knot. You live in a country where even fair complexion is a check box when it comes bride hunting; forget about T1D & Stargardt disease (Heredomacular degeneration).An optimist me would say- Dude! Chuck marriage. Learn to manage your challenges  love will come along following.During my stint as a T1D researcher  I have met many patients who gave up on their challenge  fell into depression and became ugly (in the literal sense).
