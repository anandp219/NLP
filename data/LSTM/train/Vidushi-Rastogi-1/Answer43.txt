  Freelancing has appeared as a choice of employment for a wide range of employees. It is now an economically viable option to people who like to work at their own terms  who prefer to devote certain duration of time for a project  who have time/space constraints and who prefer it until they find their dream job.According to a 2010 survey conducted by Intuit   a software company   by 2020 four out of every ten American (i.e. 40% of US workforce) would go for freelancing. This trend is bound to be replicated in EU and other developed countries.
