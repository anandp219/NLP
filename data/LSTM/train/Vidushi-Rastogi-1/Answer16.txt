  1. Don't have unrealistic goals : overestimating your own strength leading to obvious failure  breaks you.2. Don't mix personal and professional life : The cool dude who seems to be doing great at his job and has a hot girlfriend does serious effort to balance his life.3. Don't keep going when going gets boring : take a break before your target burns you out.4. Don't keep clinging to a target : Recurrent failures sometimes have a straightforward meaning - you suck!5. Don't quit when you are close : if you are close enough to target  perhaps you need another try (or a retrial).P.S.
