Added to all this is a technology which obviously has political repercussions. But what makes Antman so awesome? It is its script that seamlessly weaves all of it in one fabric.The dialoguesI found them the most engaging part of the movie after the concept. They are sarcastic  funny and offer a fair share of giggles. Michael Penas (Luis) lip sync  Michael Douglas (Pym) shoot me again  Evangeline Lillys (Hope) fight with Paul Rudd (Scott Lang) and Scotts daughter  Cassies this toy is so ugly are hilarious.
