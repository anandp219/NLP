  One can find good answers about how was life for someone born in 90's or what one must be familiar with being a 90's kid.All I can reiterate is I miss the basic phone. The life was simpler.Too much information  constant update of information and urgency to respond to the information which is nothing lesser than total rubbish has been a routine now... all thanks to smartphones.Ah! I miss that neutral ringtone... I do appreciate the ease we have got with smartphones around. But the background noise of information irates me.
