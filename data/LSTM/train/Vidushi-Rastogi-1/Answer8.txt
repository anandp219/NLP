C-peptide  a component of Proinsulin is reported to have beneficial impact on nerve functions  renal structure and renal function. C peptide is not available with commercial insulin preparations. Hence  engineering proinsulin gene in plants would have an added advantage over insulin.Other autoantigens in order of significance are Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65)  Insulinoma Associated-2 antigen (IA-2)  Heat Shock Protein (HSP)  Zinc transporter-8 (ZnT8)  Pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor 1 (PDX1)  Chromogranin A (CHGA).
