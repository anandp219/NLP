Irrespective of his erratic hours   they try to have at least one meal together. I have seen them waiting for hours just to eat together. They pick on each other   throw snide comments   call each other names but can't live without. I became friends with them when I was dating my husband. Since then we have been like 4 pieces of a pie. We four have been staying together even after we got married (this was supposedly the litmus test of their friendship ! )Our home is like Central Perk. We have our weekdays like people have their weekends.
