  Hell Yes !My husband has been friends with two people for 8 years now.They have been living together all these years and have survived professional and personal turmoils. They are so close that their families consider themselves to be having 3 sons. Inseparable they are. They share some common interests (like travel   photography   movies and shopping) but have colossal differences in nature. My husband   Harsh and Vishal are business analysts and Amit is a chef. People familiar with hospitality industry must be knowing that they have a difficult lifestyle   long work hours and no holidays.
