The TW  with his massive following takes the cherry of the cake. This seemingly non-proportionate appreciation has come from his previous work on quora or his work in real life. A two line answer by Jimmy Wales fetches >1k up-votes every time because we respect him for his works in real life and we are really glad that he typed those two lines.For an audience either you are a good writer or an important person in real life. If you are neither   become a follower of either and get benefitted.Thanks for A2A.
