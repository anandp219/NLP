Even now  in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.Neo: What truth?Morpheus: That you are a slave  Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.- The Matrix (1999)Spirituality is for people who have felt that there is more to the world than just materialism  that the world exists beyond what they can touch  see  smell  hear or taste.
