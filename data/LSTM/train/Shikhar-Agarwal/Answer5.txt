One day  there was a banana kept on my table. I picked it up  showed on camera  and said  "A mosquito was sitting on it. Is it now safe to eat it?" And my parents just kept on laughing. The other day  my mother showed me the fruit fig. I blurted out  "this onion is so small!" (It looked like it..)Yes  stupidity is good.
