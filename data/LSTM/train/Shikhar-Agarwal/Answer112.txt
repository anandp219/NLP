Texts and words turn into knowledge when you accept these. Knowing and accepting are two different things.Kauravas were told by a lot of people  including their gurus  but they never accepted it. And people like Bhishma  who accepted it  were just following their dharma by fighting from the side of Kauravas. So none of them had any reason to fear Krishna.
