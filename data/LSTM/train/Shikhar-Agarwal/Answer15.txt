If Surya had helped him  all the respect  glory and his status as epitome of karma  generosity  bravery and courage would have died with him. Karna didn't live to die  but died to live  taking a place in history that perhaps even Arjuna couldn't take. Who wouldn't be proud to have a son like him?Sun did set early that day. But it wasn't the one that you see in the day  it was the one that lit even the night.
