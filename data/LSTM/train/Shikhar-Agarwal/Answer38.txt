  If we had only those people who believe what they see  Google would have died in Stanford before it could born  computers would have still be only in big research labs and we would have been traveling from France to India on foot  if ever they were discovered.On the other hand  if only those who see what they believe existed  cats would have been the speed-breakers (referring to a superstition)  females would have no hope for equality and the fake godmen would have looted the entire population.For growth of boons in this world  we need the latter - they are the visionaries  the risk takers  the entrepreneurs  the leaders  the dreamers.To check the growth of banes in the world and to maintain life's practicality  we need the former - they are the logical and practical people  the realists.Who is better?
