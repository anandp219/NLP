  Let's consider an example to understand the subtlety. Suppose you want to write an answer on Quora to get large number of upvotes. What all things are under your control? You can only write a well-explained answer - you cannot control the number of votes. And therefore Gita says that don't expect upvotes or worry about those  just do your karma of writing great answers and treat this as your dharma to pass knowledge to the readers (which is what Quora's mission is: To share and grow the world's knowledge)Now's let draw an analogy.
