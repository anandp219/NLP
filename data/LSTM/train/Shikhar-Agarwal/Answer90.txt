For Vibhishan  it was to choose between his evil brother and his reverent Lord Rama. For Karna  it was a choice between his best friend supporting adharma and Pandavas  his real family fighting for good cause. Each of these choices are right and also wrong. Is it right to leave your family in times of difficulties and challenges? Is it right to support and contribute to the evil side?At this junction  the catch is the following: whatever you choose  you would have to accept the consequences. And the problem reduces to choosing the path where you would be happier to accept the outcome.
