What may seem like sufferings are actually trials which tests you  hurt you  cut you  embarrass you - but not to make you weak  but to make you strong so that you can shine like a diamond.So that's why one has to "suffer" before becoming successful - because success comes only after experimentation and taking risks  which automatically invites failures. But what we see as sufferings are just the stumbling blocks  which give the successful people necessary strength to convert these into stepping stones.
