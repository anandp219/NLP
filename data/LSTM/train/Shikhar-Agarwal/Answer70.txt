It is an extraordinary feat  rare to achieve  and shows excellence and brilliance in Maths  Physics  Astronomy  Manufacturing and so on. The international media is full of praise for India. NASA itself has send its heartiest congratulations. People in the entire world are giving a standing ovation. Today  India has earned renewed respect  and I am feeling it trickling down to me.Unless India stands up to the world  no one will respect us. In this world  fear has no place. Only strength respects strength.
