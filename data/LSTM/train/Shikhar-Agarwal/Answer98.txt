  Checkout the picture below  observe it and pay attention to your thoughts. (image src: And when we whisper... )I showed it to my friend and he said that it's such a lovely picture - a cute black child is playing with another cute white child. And that's it. The adults in our society would say this. But for the 2 babies in the picture  there is no race  no judgement  no intolerance  no division and no barrier. For each of them  the other is a fellow human being  and they are happy to greet each other with open arms.
