  Ever wondered why diamond shines so brilliantly? It shines after it has been cut by friction. Similarly gold cannot be purified without fire. People cannot become successful just by reading motivational books or attending lectures and seminars. They have to experiment  fail  experiment harder  fail harder and go through this cycle again and again. They have to walk miles on foot to save a penny  bear all the criticism and tantrums thrown by the society  and spend sleepless nights on their desks.
