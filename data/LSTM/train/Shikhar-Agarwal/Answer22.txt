God is everywhere  but people want to pray to Him  ask favors  offer food  tell stories  bathe Him  play with Him and do what they do in their lives. Creating a human-like idol creates an image of God as a companion  a guide  a friend  a protector  a giver  a fellow being and so on. An idol is just a concrete representation where they find Him. When I look into the eyes of an idol  I do not see stone or metal  but another pair of eyes looking affectionately at me  smiling.
