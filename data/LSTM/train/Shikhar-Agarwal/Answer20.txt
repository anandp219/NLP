  Once Swami Vivekananda visited King of Alwar in present day Rajasthan. The king in an attempt to mock idol worship told Swamiji  "I've no faith in idol worship. How can one worship stone  wood and metal? I believe people are in illusion and just wasting time!". Swamiji smiled. He asked the king's assistant to take down the picture of the king that was hanging on the wall. Although confused  the assistant did so. Then Swamiji ordered him  "Spit on the picture!". The assistant was shocked and looked at both of them.
