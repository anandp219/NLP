  I was going to sleep when I decided to check Quora one last time. I noticed a new A2A. When I read the question  the first thing that came to my mind was  "Am I already dreaming?" :)For me  it's like a dream come true - a dream that I along with several other millions of people saw as a nation - to have more Nobel laureates from India. Mr Kailash Satyarthi  you have made us all very proud. Such a noble deed  and such a nobel prize! Congratulations!To be very frank  I am not happy just because an Indian won a Nobel Prize.
