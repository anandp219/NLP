  Trinity: I know why you're here  Neo. I know what you've been doing... why you hardly sleep  why you live alone  and why night after night  you sit by your computer. You're looking for him. I know because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me  he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer. It's the question that drives us  Neo. It's the question that brought you here. You know the question  just as I did.Neo: What is the Matrix?Trinity: The answer is out there  Neo.
