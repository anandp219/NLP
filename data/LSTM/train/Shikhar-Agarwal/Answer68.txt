  It was 5th November 2013 when India's historic Mars mission Mangalyaan made tryst with destiny and social media  instead of being a part of the dream very few could see  was flooded with questions like "Why waste money on the Mars mission when it could have been used for education  poverty and hunger reduction  healthcare and so on?" And today  when Mangalyaan conquered Mars  the world is at a loss of words. There are no questions being asked  no comments being passed. It's just pure admiration  admiration for the dream  admiration of the work well done  admiration that it just took $75 million compared to NASA's $671 million  admiration that India is the first and the only country in the world to reach Mars' orbit in its first attempt.
