(src: Caste system in India)But after 67 years of real "India"  it is unjustified to blame the brahmins for the system enjoyed by their ancestors. While earlier  brahmin used to influence laws  occupy various positions just because of their castes and deny lower caste people of any opportunity  after India's independence  there has been no law which has favored the brahmin castes  nor any special position created for them. Like sati and slowly dowry  these social evils can be addressed only by education and awareness  and if the Indian political framework has failed to provide these to each child and citizen  then brahmins are not at fault.
