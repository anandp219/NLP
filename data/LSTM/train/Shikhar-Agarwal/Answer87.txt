If you are giving a lecture to a targeted audience  then perhaps it is fine to refer Hindu/Indian mythology as Purana  but in order for the masses to understand on Quora  I don't prefer being too technical.For those people who prefer Purana to "mythology" because the latter gives a false impression of "myths"  let me tell you that a lot of people believe Bhagavad Gita is real and given its association with Mahabharata and "mythology"  there is already a conception that Hindu mythology is not truly a "mythology".
