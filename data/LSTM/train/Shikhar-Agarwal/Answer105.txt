  Rahul Dravid once said in his speech:I got reading on the Chinese bamboo and learned that the tree takes 5 years  3 months to grow to its whole height of 80 feet. Yet  for the first 5 years  you can only see a tiny green shoot  but in the next 90 days  it grows into a full-fledged tree. But in those first 60 months  it is growing its strong network of roots underground  to support the tree. In an era of instant gratification  we settle for shorter trees  but remember patience has its reward.Satyameva Jayate translates to "Truth alone triumphs".
