I would like to end this with a part of speech which Jawaharlal Nehru gave on India's Independence:The achievement we celebrate today is but a step  an opening of opportunity  to the greater triumphs and achievements that await us. Are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?I know we are  we just have to prove it. Congratulations in advance for many more to come. To India  I bow  Jai Hind.
