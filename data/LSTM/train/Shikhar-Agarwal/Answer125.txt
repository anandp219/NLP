Questions and doubts like  "Why is there so much suffering"  "What is the purpose of life"  etc haunted him. But if he had just gone back to his kingdom  would we be talking about a mortal attaining immortality sitting under a banyan tree in the middle of nowhere in India?Doubt is just like a seed - if given proper nourishment  it can grow into a lavish tree with splendid fruits  but if ignored  it just becomes another grain in the sands of time. So it is the combination of doubt and conscious efforts that can lead to the ultimate truth.
