  No  not at all. Lack of education is the biggest evil  followed by the politicians who believe in divide and rule as far as caste system is concerned in modern India.If you had asked this question 60 years ago  I would have shouted Yes. While there are several theories on the origin of the caste system  ranging from corrupt and powerful brahmins and kings to foreign invaders  brahmins did enjoy an upper hand. Caste system was one of the biggest evil when India got independence. In fact  Mahatma Gandhi started the Harijan movement to create awareness about its adverse social impact.
