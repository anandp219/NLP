The good thing about Hinduism is that it has the flexibility to evolve with time. Burning traditional firecrackers might have been good a decade ago  but in today's world  they are a major nuisances. So the need of the hour is to learn from the West and evolve Diwali to use green firecrackers.So just don't blame others when you see them celebrating Diwali. Educate them about these new firecrackers and innovate to manufacture these at large scale and low cost. Evolve your consciousness so that you take care of environment in your day-to-day life.
