  What is fair? It would have been fair if Karna had advised his best friend not to insult and assault Draupadi. It would have been fair if he had asked Drona not to make a plan which involved merciless killing of Abhimanyu. If he was so strong  powerful and confident  why didn't he single handedly fight Abhimanyu? No  I am neither implying he was less powerful than Abhimanyu or Arjuna nor am I doubting his strength. I just want to highlight the fact that Mahabharata was a dharma-yudh  a fight to establish righteousness and fairness  and Karna not only supported adharma  he was an active contributor.
