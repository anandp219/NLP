Whenever the balance between adharma and dharma shifts in the favor of the former  Krishna comes to restore it back. "Yada Yada Hi Dharmasya  Glanirva Bhavathi Bharatha Abhyuthanam Adharmaysya  Tadatmanam Srijami Aham'. "Whenever there is decay of righteousness O! Bharatha And a rise of unrighteousness  then I manifest Myself!" Bhagavad Gita (Chapter IV-7)You may ask why does he care for the world  why is he so attached to it when he himself says in the Gita to remain unattached? The answer is that he is not.He is doing what he says  he is following his dharma  his responsibility to show us the path  the path to our goals  aspirations and a righteous  fulfilled life.Whatever action a great man performs  common men follow.
