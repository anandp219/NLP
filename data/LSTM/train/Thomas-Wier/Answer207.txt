Bert Vaux and Josh Katz came up with a great dialect quiz that uses 25 linguistic isoglosses (roughly  dialect features distinctive to particular regions) that  when overlaid each other  gives a pretty accurate assessment of where you grew up (if you stayed in one place anyway). You can take that quiz here  and it will make you a personalized dialect map: The New York TimesIn my case  it guessed pretty closely that I grew up in Texas  though I'm actually from Houston not the Dallas-Fort Worth area:Actually  Houston dialect is kinda a mix of upper Southern and Deep Southern -- it stands right at the border -- so it's not surprising that the algorithm would identify some Deep Southern aspects of my speech  though no one would guess I'm even from the South based on the way I talk.
