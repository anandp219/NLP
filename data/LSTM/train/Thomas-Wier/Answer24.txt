This means  from a cognitive perspective  they simply don't have the same experience of learning Georgian as they would Spanish or German  which can be taught in schools in the west from a young age.Thus in my experience it is a combination of facts internal to the language  and the sociolinguistic context in which it is spoken that make it difficult for foreigners to learn Georgian properly.
