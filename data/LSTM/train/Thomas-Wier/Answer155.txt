  No  (pace Lee Ballentine and Alan Dawkins) it is not true  for two reasons:(1) In English  not all Latin-derived words retain their original Latinate plural endings. Thus scientific words like antenna can have a plural antennae (alongside the Anglo-Saxon antennas  with different meanings attached to the distinct plurals)  and a Kulturwort like forum can sometimes (in highstyle) take a Latinate plural fora  but the vast majority of Latin words directly imported into English do not retain their Latinate plurals.
