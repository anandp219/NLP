active da-c'er-a 'he wrote it' vs. passive da-i-c'er-a 'it got written'. In Ossetic  passives are usually formed analytically with a past participle plus an auxiliary that means 'go': arazin 'to build' vs. arazt tsuin 'to be built'.Georgian  like Russian  German  French and other languages  distinguishes between an unmarked en 'you (sg)' and both a plural and polite singular tkven 'y'all/you(polite)'; Ossetic does not use the plural pronoun for politeness.In Georgian  the imperative is always exactly identical to the aorist tense form; in Ossetic  there is a special dedicated imperative form.In Georgian  the subject of some intransitive verbs is marked the same way as the subject of transitive verbs  while the subject of other intransitive verbs is marked the same way as the object of transitive verbs (a so-called Activestative language); in Ossetic  the subjects of intransitive pattern like the subjects of transitives (or a Nominativeaccusative language)  just as in most European languages.
