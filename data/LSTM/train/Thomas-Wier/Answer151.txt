SOV languages often also have postpositions rather than prepositions)  the kinds of unusual features that would point toward some kind of language contact between Georgian and Ossetic come back in the negative. This is even true on the vocabulary level  since a comparison of the 100 most basic words in Georgian and Ossetic (Georgian Swadesh list and Ossetian Swadesh list) shows that they share very few if any words in common -- unexpected if Ossetic and Georgian have been intensively borrowing from each other.So the bottom line is that Georgian and Ossetic are quite different from each other linguistically  both historically and in today's languages.
