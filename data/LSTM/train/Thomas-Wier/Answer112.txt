Surprisingly few truly Russian words have entered into Georgian speech: words like  vap'she 'in general'   vsio 'complete  done'   p'rost'a 'simply' all fall into this category. I want to emphasize that no one really has done the proper research on this issue  so my estimate above is more like a guestimate. But it gives you some idea of the distribution of loans and native words.
