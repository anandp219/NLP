However  if we look at a wider paradigm  we see that this is the only instance when the verb 'responds' to the properties of the noun: I run we run you run y'all run the boy runs the boys runIn all other cases  the form of the verb is not changing in response to the properties of the noun. So are the other five forms agreeing with the noun  or not? On at least one reading  the morphological one  they are not agreeing with it  since they show no evidence of changing their form in accord with their argument.
