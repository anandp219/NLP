  As it happens  I've actually been investigating the typology of suppletion recently as part of my research on what the languages of the Caucasus have in common. The definition that Justin Lo gave is good as a first approximation: stems like go and stems like went are indeed historically unrelated to each other (Old English gn and wendan respectively). But there exist many different problems with defining suppletive forms in this way  which might summarize as uncertainty  inadequacy and typology:Uncertainty: etymologies are often disputed or entirely unknown  especially in languages with few historical written materials.
