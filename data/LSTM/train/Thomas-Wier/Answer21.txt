Unlike English speakers  who know they have to speak more slowly and articulate their words more clearly when speaking to nonnative speakers  Georgians have no practice with this  and usually speak to foreigners just as they would to other Georgians. But more than that  it is simply an alien even surreal experience for Georgians  as if your cat began to complain about the quality of TV nowadays. More than once I've begun a conversation in Georgian  only to have the befuddled interlocutor speak back to me in English or Russian or German  such that I have to explicitly explain that I prefer to speak in Georgian.
