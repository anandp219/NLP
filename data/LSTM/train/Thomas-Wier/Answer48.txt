Writing is different  in that humans have to be trained to use writing in the same way that they have to be trained to look both ways before crossing the street  or trained how to use a knife and fork to eat. It is in other words a qualitatively different kind of cultural practice.Rather than just some skill we acquire like learning to tie our shoelaces  a better way to think about spoken language is as a biological trait that has been characteristic of humans for hundreds of thousands of years.
