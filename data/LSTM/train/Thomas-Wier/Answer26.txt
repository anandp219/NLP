The emus were destroying crops and infrastructure through wide sections of the territory  and so the farmers called in the authorities to round up the birds who were clearly becoming a nuisance. Unfortunately  the idea of culling the animals proved more difficult than it first had appeared. As one ornithologist mentioned about the events:The machine-gunners' dreams of point blank fire into serried masses of Emus were soon dissipated. The Emu command had evidently ordered guerrilla tactics  and its unwieldy army soon split up into innumerable small units that made use of the military equipment uneconomic.
