  I'm going to plunk for a slightly different answer than the one Kevin Flint chose: not the first person who left Africa  but the most recent common ancestors of us all  Y-chromosomal Adam and Mitochondrial Eve. These are of course not the Biblical Adam and Eve  but two real human individuals from whom all modern humans descend  who lived between 200k and 350k years ago.The reason I don't think the actual migration is so important is that members of the genus Homo have left Africa several times in the last 2 million years (the first left evidence in the Republic of Georgia 1.77m years ago).
