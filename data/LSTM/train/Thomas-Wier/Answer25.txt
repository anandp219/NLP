  It's not clear which history is 'our' history  but surely the most absurd war ever fought in anyone's history was the Great Emu War  waged between 2 Nov and 10 Dec in 1932 in Western Australia. Whether or not you call this a true 'war' is a matter of opinion  I suppose  as it ranged the forces of the Royal Australian Artillery  armed with machine guns  against  well  actual emus that were running amok in Western Australia. The 'war' came about because approximately 20 000 emus had migrated into marginal lands that had recently been occupied by WWI veterans.
