  I've already discussed some of the features of Georgian that make it unusual: What are the characteristics of the Georgian language? Those structural properties can be summarized as:Exhorbitant consonant clusters  both quantitatively and qualitatively more complex than almost any other language  make simple articulation of the language difficult;The polysynthetic verb morphology with subject and object agreement is complicated  but the way in which specific affixes compete for realization on the verb (see my other answer for details) is highly unusual and counterintuitive from a typological perspective;The system of case assignment  in which the case of the subject changes from one tense to the next (nominative in the present and future  narrative in the aorist  dative in the evidential perfect) is not just conceptually hard to grasp  but it makes language learning difficult because different conjugations of verbs have different patterns  so for each verb you have to learn which of the four major patterns it takes.Some of the most frequent and necessary word forms are not only irregular but also highly counterintuitive  which means you have to learn them early along with the more straightforward parts of the grammar.
