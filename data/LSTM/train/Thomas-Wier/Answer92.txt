In this language  nouns are marked for what number they are not  rather than for what number they are. In the four noun classes of the language  some are inherently singular or dual (Class I)  others are inherently dual or plural (class II)  others are inherently dual (Class III)  and yet others are mass nouns and never pluralize. What's odd about this system is that if you add an inverse suffix -gau [2] to class one  you get a plural  but if you add the very same suffix to class two  you get a singular:So for example  a class I word like c 'horse  two horses' becomes cgau 'three or more horses'  while a class II word like ths 'two or more bones' becomes thsgau 'one bone'.
