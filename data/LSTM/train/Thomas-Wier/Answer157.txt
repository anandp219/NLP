  The short answer is that probably all natural languages distinguish words that are 'nouny' from words that are 'verby'  but in some languages the contrast is very unclear. To understand this though  you need to understand what a part of speech is. A 'part of speech' is a traditional phrase that refers to a distribution class: if you have a string of words  only some words can be replaced with other words without creating an ungrammatical string. For example in "John ran into the X"  "X" can be replaced with "house"  "woods"  "river" etc.
