The theory of evolution would remain untaught; the existence of bacteria would never be mentioned. Biologists would be furious. So imagine how Prof Geoffrey Pullum feels when he sees the same thing happening in his own field every day. [...]Rules such as this have been discovered through careful study of how English speakers actually use the language. An enormous amount more is understood today than it was in  say  1900  says Pullum. There have been discoveries that make the pattern of things easier to grasp.But instead of this sort of discovery making it into popular consciousness  he says  the national discussion of grammar and language is stuck in half-remembered dictates and daft shibboleths.
