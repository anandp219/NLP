  As I've discussed before (Are there languages that have more than three grammatical genders? )  the word gender historically did not refer primarily to biological sex at all  but to a grammatical concept in which words are divided into different classes for purposes of inflection. [1] This is because gender comes from Latin genus  which simply means 'kind' or 'sort'. The Oxford English Dictionary  for example  notes this example from a Middle English grammatical text  ca. 1450:How many thyngis falleth to a noun?
