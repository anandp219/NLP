Assignment to these two genders is very largely predictable based on the meaning of the noun -- living things are animate  nonliving things are inanimate -- but in a few liminal cases there is variation. Thus large animals such as buffalo which are typically food sources are assigned to the animate gender  while smaller animals can often be assigned to the inanimate gender. [4]So indeed  there is some generalization: languages do tend to 'genderize' the kinds of foods that are important to them  and they do tend to distinguish between protein sources and sources of carbohydrates.
