Some verbs agree in gender and number with the non-ergative argument:(Taken from work by Diana Forker)In other languages  only the verb will indicate the ergative pattern. This is true of Abkhaz  which does not have cases  but does have verbs that agree with subjects  direct objects and indirect objects:(Taken from Hewitt 2005)This table shows the Abkhaz-Abaza verb agreement prefixes. The prefixes in column I show how verbs agree with either an intransitive subject or a transitive direct object  while column III shows how the verb agrees with transitive subjects.
