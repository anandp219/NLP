On top of that  many of the individual letters look very similar  with no less than 8 letters that look vaguely like the numeral '3':  /v/   /k'/   /p'/   /h/   /q'/   /p/   /g/   /ts/.Very few teachers of the language are nonnative speakers  and this has the implication that when you are first taught the language  you are being taught by people who have solid intuitions about the language  but who never had to learn the language consciously. This means that most teachers of Georgian don't really understand what features of the language are not intuitive for foreigners.Most Georgian language textbooks rely on outdated understandings of linguistic typology and often simply misanalysis of the grammar  and don't do a good job of trying to connect structures in Georgian to more familiar structures in western languages.Perhaps because Georgia was closed off to the outside world until the fall of the Soviet Union  there were historically few resources for people who actually wanted to speak the language.
