You can see this in more detail here:In other regions  like the plains of Mingrelia (Samegrelo) in western Georgia  Kakheti  Kartli or most of Azerbaijan  the topography is relatively flat and  if close enough to mountain sources of water  then good land for agriculture (especially wine  which was invented in this region some 8000 years ago). These lands have historically functioned sociolinguistically more like spread zones  as the language spoken here has shifted a number of times over recorded history.Thus the bottom line is that a large number of languages have developed in the Caucasus because the topography for most of history disfavored all but the most adventurous of movement and with it communication.
