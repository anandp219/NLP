An early modern depiction of a unicorn. It is still grammatical to refer to "the unicorn" as a class of animal  even though it does not in fact exist.Different languages with definite articles have different rules of use. Thus in German and Greek  it is quite grammatical to mark proper names with a definite article even though proper names always have unique referents: Die Sabine hab' ich gestern gesehen. In English and many other languages with definite articles  on the other hand  this is quite ungrammatical: *I saw the John yesterday.
