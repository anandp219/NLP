There is no obvious point when a loanword becomes a Georgian word -- except that words that Georgians use  are Georgian. However  to give you some sort of straightforward answer  I went through Aronson's dictionary of Georgian lexemes used in his chrestomathy to get an idea of how frequent loanwords are in actual modern texts. Based on that (very superficial survey subject to revision)  something like 30-40% of the modern Georgian lexicon is obviously foreign in origin  with modern 'international' words being now the largest and most productive source of loans:By international  I mean words that might have entered Georgian through a specific source language (often Russian)  but which are themselves not native to that language  and which are often literary or scientific in nature -- things like  aviacia (aviation)   aerop'ort'i (airport)   ek'onomik'uri (economic)  the word  internacionaluri 'international' itself  etc.
