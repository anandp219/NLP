The implication of this is that the language of an entire species would change very  very slowly -- only as quickly as genetic drift or natural selection would allow. It would also mean that members of this species could not hope to understand variant forms of the language (dialects or other languages) spoken by genetically distant members of their species.An alien language that lacked specialization would only be used in contexts when other cultural acts are done -- there would be no such thing as small-talk.But who's really the alien?And so on.
