Probably this is also connected to the way the Georgian language is closely linked to Georgian ethnic identity. Foreigners who speak Georgian do not fit the folk-understanding of ethnicity in the Caucasus that Georgians internalize from a young age. Such foreigners cannot be 'placed' and so Georgians do not know how to identify them as in-group or out-group.Georgia is anthropologically speaking a very positive-face culture: the culture prioritizes the needs of individuals to feel belonging to the group rather than individuals' needs for respect of their personal prerogatives and autonomy.
