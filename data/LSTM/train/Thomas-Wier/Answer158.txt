but not "sing"  "cogitate"  "impress"  because the former but not the latter are syntactically nouns which can be the head of a noun phrase. In most languages  the distinction between nouns and verbs is not only fairly straightforward syntactically like this  they are also morphologically distinct: a noun will inflect with a completely different class of affixes than a verb would.I say some  because even very familiar languages do not have an absolutely watertight contrast between nouns and verbs.
