We have had our share of historical tragedies: the murder and marginalization of Native Americans  African slavery  a racial caste system that still stains our consciousness. But most other major countries have had much  much more violent histories:France had Wars of Religion in the late 16th century that killed between two and four million people. Later  their eponymous revolution killed a quarter million people  about 40 thousand of which were mechanically beheaded in the Reign of Terror in the pursuit of a rigidly idealistic ideology  but most died as a result of economic dislocation and famine.
