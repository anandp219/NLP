So  if we include these latter kinds of languages  then surely Abkhaz beats most languages: it has a total of 58 phonemes in the literary language  and uses a variant of the Cyrillic alphabet with 64 letters.As you can see  like Spanish  Abkhaz systematically uses digraphs to represent particular phonetic properties: the schwa makes the preceding graph labialized  while the soft sign  indicates a palatalized consonant. These additional diacritic characters are essential to Abkhaz writing because of how many different distinctions in the sound-system are reliant upon it.
