They had mastery of fire and tool-use and  I would assert  something resembling modern language (with open-ended lexicons and potentially hierarchical syntax -- see my answer to When did language originate?). But they did not as far as we can tell engage in fishing  create composite tools  make figurative art on cave walls or decorate their bodies  or have regionally distinctive cultures of artifact creation -- they were not  in other words  behaviorally modern (Behavioral modernity). In many ways  these two individuals would be very foreign to us -- they would resemble us perfectly in a physical sense  but their behaviors would be difficult to recognize.
