Because in Abkhaz there are not any grammatical cases to speak of  the ergative pattern is visible only in the verb agreement system. Such systems are somewhat rarer than ergativity reflected in nominal case. Compare the two following WALS maps: Alignment of verb agreement Alignment of nominal caseAs you can see  a number of languages have ergative case marking systems but nominative-accusative alignment for their verb agreement -- but not all. These kinds of incongruities illustrate the larger point that alignment types like ergativity are patterns of constructions  not patterns of whole languages  and not something inherent in particular morphological affixes.Works Cited:Hewitt  G. 2005.
