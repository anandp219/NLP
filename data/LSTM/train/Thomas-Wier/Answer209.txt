As I noted in a previous answer  in the Vaupes region of the Amazon  knowing five or more languages is actually a must  since you can only get married to someone who speaks a different language: How many languages is too many for a small child to be learning at once? In such a culture  knowing only three languages would not make people think you are particularly polyglottal.
