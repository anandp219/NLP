Between 1928 and 1949  an estimated 8 million people died as a result of just the civil war. This is of course not to mention the 15-20 million additional people who died during the Second World War fighting the Japanese (during which the Communists and Republicans called a truce). After the Communists secured victory  they instituted policies that lead to the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution  which between them killed a staggering 45-60 million people (mostly from famine  though at least one million landlords were executed during the Cultural Revolution).
