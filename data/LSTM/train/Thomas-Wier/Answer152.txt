  There probably is some truth to this claim  but it mostly boils down to what dialect of a language you've been most exposed to. The dialects of colonial languages that formed in the Western Hemisphere in the last 400-500 years have a few things in common:They were not drawn from a single source dialect in their respective mother-countries  but rather from a large variety of different  sometimes only partially intelligible dialects. This resulted in Koineization  or flattening out  of the differences between dialects that resulted from a linguistic bottleneck:Here  a linguistic bottleneck is analogous to a biological genetic bottleneck: a speciation event occurs (such as migration) that results in a smaller set of features (here  features of a dialect) than in the original population.
