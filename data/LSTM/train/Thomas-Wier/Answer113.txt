  The short answer is yes: many languages that have more than three genders have special genders that distinguish domesticated from wild animals  or edible food from inedible vegetation  or the like. (More than three genders? Yes: see my previous answers: Are there languages that have more than three grammatical genders? and Is gender in a language a misleading word? )As I noted in previous answers  gender in language is simply one way of dividing the world up into categories of things  so it should not be surprising that food  which is important in all human societies  ranks among the categories most frequently marked in language gender systems.
