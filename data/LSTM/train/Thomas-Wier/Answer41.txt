In fact  some speakers also have a regular paradigm for the root t'an- 'carry' in the present tense as well  so what we might have here is in fact two only partially merged verbs: one (kv-) that is defective and uses the other (t'an-) for its other tenses  and one that is fully formed (t'an-). So although Georgian case marking is totally strange if you compare it to other languages  these forms are strange even in comparison to other Georgian forms. Georgian is an exceptionally complicated language morphologically  but an even more striking example from the Caucasus is Udi  spoken in Azerbaijan and in a few villages in Georgia.
