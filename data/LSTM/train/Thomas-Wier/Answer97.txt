Map of pidgin and creole languages around the worldThere are even a few cases of so-called mixed languages  where a language will take  say  all nouns from one language  but take its verbs from a completely different language. This is true of the Michif language of Canada  whose nouns come mostly from French  but whose verb system comes from Cree. The result in this language is that nouns have two genders: masculine or feminine gender from French  but a covert animate/inanimate contrast from Cree (because Cree verbs agree in animacy with their arguments).
