Other languages that single out different kinds of food sources in different genders:The Papuan language Yimas has some 11 noun genders  of which one is semantically defined by higher animals (like cassowaries  crocodiles and the like)  and another one is defined by important plants  like sago palms or coconut palms. (Most of the genders in this language are purely phonologically defined by the ending of the noun.) [1]The Australian language Warndarang has five genders in the singular  including one for plants with edible underground parts; one for trees; and one for large animals.
