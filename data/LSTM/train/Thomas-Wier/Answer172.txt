  To get at that  you have to go back a step to answer why genders systems arise in the first place. I've already answered this in other answers:Are there languages that have more than three grammatical genders? What determines the gender of newly invented nouns? Is there any language with gendered pronouns for second person? The short answer is that linguistic gender is not a reflection of biology but simply a way to divide the world up into categories so that you can keep track of pieces of information.
