We also find other variations  such as Alm  Austria  where an 'alm' is a word for a mountain pasture. The other common meaning is usually rivers  of which there are many: the Elbe  Alf and Alb rivers in Germany; the Aube in France (< Vulgar Latin *Alba); suffixed forms like Germany's Elber (<*Albira) or Spain's Albuera (< *Albora)  or Switzerland's Alvra  and in antiquity another name for the Tiber was Albula (= 'little Alba'). All the variants have /al/ plus a labial consonant  plus possible suffixes.
