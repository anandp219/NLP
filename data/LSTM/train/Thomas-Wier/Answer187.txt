like the agent of transitives (so-called active verbs)  while the the single argument of other intransitive verbs will pattern like the object of transitive verbs.In the next stage  some of these languages were then believed to evolve into Ergativeabsolutive languages. In the most advanced stage  some of the ergative languages were believed to evolve into Nominativeaccusative languages.If this theory had been true  it would have been very profound  since it places strict constraints on how languages can evolve.
