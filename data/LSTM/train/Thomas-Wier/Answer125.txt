There is no historical documentation of the Armenians for centuries after their likely entry into the peninsula  just archaeological evidence  and a burn layer does not tell you who burned a city down. Certainly they could have conquered and killed off the previous inhabitants  but we have no evidence of that.In any event  a larger point of course is that whatever the sins of the fathers (= late Bronze Age wandering tribes) might be  that does not justify punishing the sons (early 20th century ethnic Armenians).
