Georgian suppletive forms (taken from Aronson 1990 and Hewitt 1995)Like English  Georgian often has different stems for different tenses (NB: all these forms are third person singular subject and third singular object.) What's interesting about this system is that often roots are shared not just between some tenses and not others  but also between different verbs. The only difference between 'he will be' and 'he will have it' is not the suppletive stem  but the preradical vowel. In some cases  such as 'say' and 'tell'  not only are identical roots used in some tenses of two different verbs and not others  the verb forms themselves might be totally identical in some tenses and not others.
