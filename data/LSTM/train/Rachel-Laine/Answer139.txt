  Cooking for someone usually involves effort and time and love  which are all just as important as your preference for broccoli over asparagus. There are ways to diplomatically communicate your preferences to your spouse while still (genuinely  hopefully) expressing appreciation for all of their energy and effort. One approach is to be more emphatic in your praise of the dishes that you really enjoy rather than picking apart the dishes that you dislike. People tend to respond well to positive feedback and generally less well to negative feedback.
