Glancing around at the little  micro-tidbits of other people's lives that we see on social media or the carefully curated ad campaigns that we are bombarded with  it's easy to get caught up thinking that "somethings" are the cure for what ails us. We easily slip into thinking that changing our hair or our nose will change our life  just like it's easy to think that changing our popularity or bank balance will make us happy.
