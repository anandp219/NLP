  You mention that things "feel incredibly jumbled". I think that this is a really great way to describe how the breakup of a relationship feels. You can feel it emotionally and physically. Almost like someone has put your insides in cement mixer. It sounds to me like you are thinking about some good things in the wake of this breakup. That's great. The people who we really care about and play an important role in our lives inevitably change us (and we them) and I don't think that this is a bad thing.
