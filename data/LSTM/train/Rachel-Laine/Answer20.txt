I noticed that the giant bulge remained throughout dinner and dessert. This is when I began to feel quite uncomfortable - it was a blind date  after all. I reassured myself that we were in a public place and everything would be fine. When we left the restaurant J pulled a ginormous  mount-on-your-dash-sized GPS unit out of his pocket. First I was relieved  but then I was even more weirded out. Who carries around a GPS in their pocket (this was pre-smart phone)? He explained to me that he thought it would be useful if we wanted to find a coffee shop after dinner.
