  This question was a bit awkward to me (kidding  sort of...). Most people aren't social rock stars in all situations nor are they socially awkward in all situations. Have you ever met that ridiculously charismatic person at a party who just seems to float around on a rainbow of light  followed by a trail of laughter and awe? Even they are awkward in some situations. Disappointing  right?As social media and lightening fast internet and cheap air travel make our worlds bigger we are exposed to a larger cross section of people.
