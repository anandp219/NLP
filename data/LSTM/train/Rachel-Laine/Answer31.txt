  I did not start wearing makeup until I entered college world. Well  aside from a visit or two to the Clinique counter with my mom in high school when they slapped some strangely green-ish taupe shadow and brown liner on my lids. So  yeah  I was a little clueless (understatement). And  like you  I wanted to look nice for dates and more formal events and parties. I wanted to feel like a glamorous 20-something person when I went out at night. You have several options for bulking up your makeup prowess.
