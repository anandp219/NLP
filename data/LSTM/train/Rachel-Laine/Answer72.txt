Take the class with her  if possible!Doesn't need things/Know her well:When your mother doesn't need another blue sweater or another pan or more towels or more whatever  it's nice to spend the day with her doing things that she loves. Treat your mother to a mother/daughter spa day at a great spa. Get massages and mani/pedis and then go out for a relaxing lunch and a glass of wine.If your mother is the outdoorsy sort  plan a great hike and a fabulous picnic with all of her favorite foods. Or take her kayaking or sail-boating.If your mother is into art  plan a day gallery hopping at all the best galleries.
