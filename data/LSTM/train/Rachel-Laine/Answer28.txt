What does your husband do?" They asked me nothing about what I do or my life. I told them that J is a computer guy  to which they responded  "Wow! That must be so nice - the success (wink) - and you get to come and buy shoes!!!" hmmmkaaay... I wore my trophy shoes on our next date to a nice restaurant in SF (we were celebrating an anniversary). J wore a logo tee  naturally. We were showered with a ridiculously embarrassing amount of attention by the manager  the sommelier  and the waiter. I mean  at a certain point it crosses a line from "attentive" to "why don't you just join us at our table".
