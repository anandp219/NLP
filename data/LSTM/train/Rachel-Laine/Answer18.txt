So  either J paid eHarmony quite handsomely to fix the matches  or there was a major bug in their matching engine  because when I received my list of matches there was only one. And that one match was  of course  Mr. J. Maybe it wasn't a fluke after all  because he proposed only a month after our first date and I happily accepted. When you are engaged to be married  your friends and family shower you with lovely and (mostly) useful gifts. Like towels and teapots and trinkets. Hindsight is 20/20  of course  and instead of allowing J to register for that soccer ball thing that you make ice cream in  I should have registered for a primer book on  "Your Life With A Programmer; The Basics " or some such.
