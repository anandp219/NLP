I don't generally endorse any sort of snooping in an intimate relationship  but if you are dating a programmer who dresses well  this is very serious. If your covert op turns up free tees he scored at Linux World and TSR tees and other free logo tees that he won at programming competitions or meetups of his favorite online games  then breathe a sigh of relief and never  ever  ever do that sneaky snooping stuff again (who told you that was okay?). He probably just bought a few special dating outfits to impress you and isn't with the NSA.
