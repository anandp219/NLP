I imagined an evil cackle after this  of course.Like acne or bad hair or painfully awkward moments with the opposite sex  braces are a rite of passage. Braces are the prepubescent equivalent of putting in your time doing grunt work and earning your stripes. Most people  however  can get away with putting in only one or two years in braces. I was given an unusually punitive 10-year sentence. When you have braces you join an extremely large sorority or fraternity of people who understand the painfully awkward initiation that you are going through and can empathize.
