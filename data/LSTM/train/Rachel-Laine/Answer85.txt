There are a lot of ways to enjoy and exercise personal freedom in your life while still maintaining meaningful relationships and avoiding harm from not participating in societal norms. A lot of the social lubricant comes from relying on what people think of us and one could argue that it is actually selfish not to care. Not caring at all what people think of you would probably be a bit of a kamikaze mission. I'm not sure how long one could go without being jailed or beat up. An interesting experiment  maybe  but I'm not so sure that you want to volunteer to be the rat in that maze.
