Okay  not weird or creepy  just pragmatic in an unusual way and well  yes  quirky. Things like this happen *a lot* when you love a programmer. When you encounter something analogous to a bulge  don't raise your eyebrows in horror  trust that he has thought things through and has everything under control. But I'm supposed to be the normal one at the party! When you love a programmer you will inevitably attend parties and events that are dominated by nerds and programmers - your sweetie's "people".
