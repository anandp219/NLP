These are the same people who will look back at your photos with you later and smile with you. When you have braces you learn that so-called "treats" like candy or cookies can become horror-filled minefields of embarrassment rivaled only by an adolescent period mishap. More than once I bravely flirted with my crush-du-jour only to later realize that my Oreo dessert never made it to my stomach and was caught in my braces like a rat in a trap. So long  dignity. It's a good thing that you wave buh-bye to your dignity early on in your braces saga  because when you have braces you learn that your parents care more about their $200 investment in your retainer than your dignity.
