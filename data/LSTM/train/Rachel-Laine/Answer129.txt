  When I was in preschool I told my mother  "You go to college and then you go to work. Then you get married and have kids. Then you die." My mother laughs heartily about this  but I knew even at 4 years old that I was expected to attend college. That there was no choice. As it turns out  I did go to college  then I started my career  then I got married  and now I'm having a child  but I digress... The sense of obligation that I felt to attend college was very real and  at the time  a real burden and source of trouble in my life.
