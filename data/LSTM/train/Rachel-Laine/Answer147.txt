This is another great way to meet new people who share an interest and you will get better at something that you can pursue your entire life while you're at it. Alternatively  if you belong to a church  perhaps think about joining the choir or ask if they need someone who plays the instrument you play. While we are on the subject  if you do belong to a church  consider participating in youth group activities. You say that you like reading and learning. Is there a book club in your area that you could join?
