During your summers off from university you can pursue makeup certifications and work as a makeup artist. After graduation  why not try working a 9-5 corporate job to build up some savings and business experience  and do makeup for weddings or somesuch on weekends? Eventually you might build up a big enough clientele/reputation that you can switch to makeup only. You can both pursue your passion and earn a degree. Dads are actually pretty handy  believe it or not.
