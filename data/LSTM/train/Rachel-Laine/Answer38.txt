"Darn Kids!! ": Do you remember sitting in those uncomfortable little wooden chairs? Recall the dismal offerings in the cafeteria? Wouldn't it have been fantastic if schools offered the same ergonomic work stations and fantastic break rooms that corporations build to lure and retain the best workers? Until most k-12 school have either a serious infusion of cash or a major incentive to build nap pods and bring in world-class chefs for their students  I suspect uncomfortable chairs and cardboard pizza Tuesdays it will be.
