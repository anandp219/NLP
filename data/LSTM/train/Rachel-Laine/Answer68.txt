Ultimately  employers want to attract  hire  and retain good employees. Most employers also care about each of their employees and want to promote their health and well-being (which also serves goal number one). One way to attract good employees is to offer benefits that good employees want. Great maternity and paternity leave benefits fall squarely into this category. Maternity and paternity benefits aren't designed as a slight to non-parents just as offering vegetarian options in the cafeteria isn't designed as a slight to carnivores or offering a health club membership isn't designed as a slight to the workout averse.
