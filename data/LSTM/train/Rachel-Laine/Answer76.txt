While I'm sure that some people take dating to the extreme even in college with fancy dinners and ski vacations and gifts  this is the exception not the rule. Cook spaghetti together or take a picnic to the beach. Attend parties together. Take in a cheap movie. Volunteer somewhere together. There are countless things to do that don't involve emptying your wallet (or your parent's wallet). If it is your parents who are subsidizing your life right now  have you thought about why they might be doing this?
