When I talk to parents about why they pay for their children's educations I get all sorts of reasons  but the gist is usually to help to them get a really great head start on their adult life. These parents are looking to give their children an advantage  not to hinder their social lives. It's possible that they would be quite sad and surprised to discover that you have shut down an entire aspect of your life on their account. Tip: Keep everyone happy by keeping your grades up and maintaining balance in your life.
