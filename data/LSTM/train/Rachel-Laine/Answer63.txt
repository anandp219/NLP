The NPR article that I have linked below details pretty nicely just how poorly students in the US are doing so I will spare you the bleak statistics.Why will the US ramp up efforts to fix the broken STEM education system? Because jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)  goods-producing industries like construction  manufacturing  and mining will lose many thousands of jobs between years 2002 and 2022. During those same years  healthcare and business service industries will gain many thousands of jobs.
