  The essence of this question  I think  is: Do you have the right to privacy on your personal mobile phone? I suppose the answer lies in how much crime you are willing to tolerate in your society in exchange for personal liberty (in this case  a private cell phone). To take this to this to the sort of logical extreme that would make Spock blush  if we wanted to have no crime we absolutely could. It would just cost us a lot of money and some of our freedoms and almost all of our privacy. So of course  we are willing to tolerate some crime to avoid opening the door to Big Brother.
