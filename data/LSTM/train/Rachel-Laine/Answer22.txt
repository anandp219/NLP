Maybe for the first time in your life  you will feel like the "weird one" at a social event. Your gorgeous hunk of programmer can then revel in the sweet  sweet  "oh  how the tables have turned" glory. You will find that it is hard for you to join in on the small talk because it isn't small talk at all. Rather  it's in-depth discussion about duck eggs and pet ducks or how to make your own cheese and incredibly  incredibly in-depth discussions about coal. As an outsider  feel free to occasionally chime in with things like "I like cheese."
