  There are surely exceptions  but I think it's generally unwise to put your life on hold until you achieve whatever goal or milestone it is you have in mind. It can be quite a slippery slope. "I will start dating when I am self-supporting" can quickly turn into "I will start dating when I make above x dollars per year and I can attract a better woman." I have fallen into this trap a time or two myself and have more than a few regrets. There was a time in my life when I was quite overweight and I told myself that I would socialize more when I lost weight or I would buy clothes when I lost weight.
