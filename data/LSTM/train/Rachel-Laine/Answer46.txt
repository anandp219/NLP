As hard as it is (and  trust me  I know this is hard)  try and keep your eye on the bigger picture. You say that it is not possible for you to be truly happy at this private school. Is it possible for you to be truly happy if there is strife in your home? Is it possible for you to be happy if your parents always trust you less because they feel that you made the wrong choice? Why is it not possible for you to be happy at private school? Is it a choice between happy or not happy or could you find ways to be happy?
