There is absolutely no dignified or non-gross way to take out your retainer to eat lunch with your cooler-than-you (as they always are) friends. Removing a drool covered piece of plastic and metal from your piehole is just always gross. And it's even grosser and less dignified when you have to go digging for it in a dumpster after you throw it away. Which you inevitably will. It WILL happen. And your parents will make you dig for it. And it will probably be taco day or lasagna day or sloppy joe day.Not everything about having braces was bad  though.
