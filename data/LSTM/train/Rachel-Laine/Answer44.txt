While I might be a perfectly content employee with merely a lot of great ideas for improvement  if I submit an overly long list of opportunities for improvement  it's possible that my employer will incorrectly assume that I'm quite dissatisfied. Finally  I like to keep the attention span of my audience in mind. While each of your ideas might be absolutely  stunningly fabulous  it's possible that a consultant will go cross-eyed reading a really long list and your best ideas will be lost. Keeping it brief gives your best ideas the best chance.
