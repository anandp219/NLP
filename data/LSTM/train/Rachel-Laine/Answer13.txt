Because the truth is that it doesn't really matter. And don't underestimate people. People are generally wise to gossip and can see through it  even if they have fun while "in the moment" sharing a juicy bit or two with their friends.

Here on Quora  sharp users will warn you not to engage with trolls or "not to feed the trolls."
