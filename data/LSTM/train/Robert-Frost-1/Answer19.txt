Gene Roddenberry saw Captain Kirk as a futuristic Horatio Hornblower. The Hornblower novels  by C.S. Forester  follow Horatio throughout his career - from midshipman to Admiral of the Fleet. I would like to see a series that followed a character throughout their Starfleet career  starting with their first assignment and leading to their first command. The perspective of the audience would change as that character climbed the ladder. We'd see adventures from below decks during the first season  rarely seeing the bridge or the captain  similar to the excellent Star Next: The Next Generation season 7 episode "Lower Decks".What I most don't want to see is dark rooms.
