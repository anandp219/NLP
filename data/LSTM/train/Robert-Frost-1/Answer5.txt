  The cast had been playing those roles for 15 years. They knew their characters. They were protective of those characters. They knew what makes Star Trek. Stuart Baird had never seen an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. He didn't know the world. He didn't know the characters.That created friction whenever Baird required the actors to do something their characters wouldn't do.Star Trek: Nemesis doesn't feel like Star Trek. The characters are not true to their fifteen years of history. It's a bad film.
