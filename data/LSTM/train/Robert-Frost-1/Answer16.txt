  The idea of a new Star Trek television series excites me. Star Trek belongs on television not in the cinema.BUT... I am concerned that the series will be produced by Alex Kurtzman  one of the producers and writers of the Abrams Star Trek films. I did enjoy the first of those films  but the second one is beyond embarrassing. Star Trek Into Darkness is not the product of people that understand Star Trek. It is not the product of people that understand story-telling.Kurtzman's television productions are a mixed bag.
