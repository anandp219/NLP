If you have the energy to power a warp drive and a transporter  you have energy to turn the damn lights on. I want a show that is bright figuratively and literally.Star Trek is incredibly important to me. It is a fictional world that I crave to visit. It has influenced every facet of my life. I so much want more of it  but I don't want it to be soiled.
