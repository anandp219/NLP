So be watchful for this. Thankfully with the car accelerating  braking and steering for you  this gives you a lot of cycles to pay attention to jerks who are try to squeeze into your lane.The auto pilot seems to have disabled vanilla traffic assisted cruise control and in particular taken away the ability to enable it at low speeds ( which was great for stop and go traffic ). You could tap on the cruise control stick  and it would just maintain it's speed. I hope this is something they bring back.
