It's one thing to speculate and think about it  though experiencing autopilot was one of those moments where I felt that future is completely certain.Stop and go traffic:Traffic assisted cruise control ( i.e. accelerating and braking the car with traffic moving and stopping constantly ) works extremely well and always has since it went live. With autopilot it became better because it now automatically resumes.Self steering works well if they turns aren't sharp  since it follows lane markings to guide itself  it's not great at adjusting speed for sharp turns.So stick to the car only controlling speed and steer manually if the roads are sharp and curvy.Indicator driven lane changes:I've only tried to use the indicators for lane switching on a freeway  and they work well.
