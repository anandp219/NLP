It's also a lot of food  so it's not a practical everyday meal.In short  it was great  but it wasn't value for money considering how good some of the other sushi options in Japan are.Was it as good as the primary Sukiyabashi Jiro location ?I don't know but given how easy it is to get reservations for it  it being about 1/3rd cheaper and it has 2 vs. 3 stars  I'd imagine it's slightly though not by much. Of course  I can't say for sure.Given that it was already in the deeper end of the cost - quality spectrumin terms of pushing the limits of how much one would pay for sushi  at least from my perspective it fell in the same mental category of super high end sushi.It's not the best option if you care about value for money  though a great place to indulge in rarely.
