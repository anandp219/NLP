Yes  in theory I can go to the answers tab on mobile  but in practice it's a lot of clicks.As a workaround  I have had to resort to deleting the Quora app and creating a bookmark to the answers subsection under notifications. I've not measured it in detail  but at first glance only 5% of the notifications I get about are for answers ( the primary notification type I care about ). Most notifications I get are about people following me or upvoting answers. This was sort of interesting when I was new to the site  though when you get so hundreds of notifications daily  the novelty wears of pretty quick.
