  Freeway traffic:Auto pilot works amazingly well. It's shocking and delightful. You'll certainly get to experience a "holy shit !" moment.I wasn't sure how well it would work it night  though I tried it and it worked like a charm. You can see how it's tracking the lanes on the display - blue lines indicate it's tracking the lanes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...This is the advertised use case  and they nailed it right. It's not a gimmick. It's the real deal.I've heard of other drivers also saying they can just hop onto a freeway and it just works.It's also a bit awkward in ways - for instance if you look at this video  you'll see how the driver is just sitting and chilling while the car drives  and he's finally trying out the web browser.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Reddit's Tesla forum has a number of other videos showing it in action:Official Autopilot v7.0 Video Thread  /r/teslamotorsThere has been talk about self driving cars and how we'd all be texting  taking pictures and watching YouTube videos while our cars drive themselves - I wrote a longer and older post about this here.
