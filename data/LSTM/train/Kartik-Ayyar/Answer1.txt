  A good though not great Nolan movie. It's hard to write a detailed review without spoilers and ruin the movie  so I'll try to keep things somewhat high level.The good parts:The core plot around finding life on another planet resonated very well with me. The acting and the initial setup was also excellent.Things only got better with the dynamic of how humans on earth communicated with the space team and the journey into space was also really well done. Some of the earlier parts were slow  but I felt they had the same dynamic as Alien: the slower parts serve as contrast for faster parts later on.Though the latter one third of the movie got a bit too weird for my tastes.
