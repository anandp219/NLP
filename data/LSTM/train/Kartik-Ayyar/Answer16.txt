The movie makes great use of crossover effects between his hallucinations and reality to tell his story.As the movie progresses  his hallucinations become increasingly powerful.The movie reminded me of The Black Swan in ways. It is sometimes up to the audience to figure out what is going on.The casting has been done really well  and the acting is superb. Michael Keaton and Emma Stone in particular absolutely blew me away by their moving performances in the film. I can see why the movie critics like this move  as well  but it is somewhat of an art film rather than a really mainstream movie.Some parts of the movie are also a bit slow.All in all  I enjoyed it  though wouldn't be too excited about watching it again if presented with the chance to do so.
