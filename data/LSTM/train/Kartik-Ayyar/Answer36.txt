  Here is a good way to start without even picking up a text book:Learn how to search an array of integers for a given number.Learn how to sort this array.Now increase the size of your array to be really  really large ( > 1 million integers ) and see if your programs you wrote earlier are still fast.Can you do anything to make your programs faster ?Just asking this simple question opens up more questions:How does one even analyze programs to analyze them ?How can developing an understanding of this analysis factor into making your programs faster ?Congratulations  you've gotten your start with learning algorithms.
