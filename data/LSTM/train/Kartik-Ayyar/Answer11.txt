It was 25% better than the other famed fish market places for a very significant price premium. If you want the absolute best and want to indulge in it  go for it.There are courses elsewhere which can be better than Jiro. The Uni for example was great  but I've had better Uni elsewhere. There are some sushi preparations which are just different. Quality of fish can be a wildcard  so it's not the be all  end all of experiencing good sushi.What made it better ?The quality of the fish for many courses was phenomenal  the tuna and shrimp for example.In some of the other courses  it was the preparation that just made them melt in your mouth.
