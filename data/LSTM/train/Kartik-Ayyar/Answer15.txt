  Birdman is a film about the struggles of Riggan Thomson ( played by Michael Keaton )  an aging actor coping with changing times. In his past  he was a star of a superhero blockbuster movie - Birdman. However  in present day times he is struggling to stay relevant as a broadway actor.I think it's a good movie that focussed on a situation many of us can relate to: when times are rough  one can't help but remember past laurels  but at the same time come to terms with how things have somehow changed.Keaton is the perfect actor to play the part given his past performance as Batman in the 80's.
