  Basically  the song is fundamentally a call to the everyday ordinary person to rebel.The song really starts of talks about how someone was murdered at a tree  and asks the listener if they want to congregate at the tree. This is symbolic of the capital atrocities against the districts.As the song progresses  it really starts to focus more on how if people met at the tree and were strong willed enough to stand up for themselves  they could be free. The song also picks up it's pace at is goes on  which captures the mood change it's trying to bring about - from one of being passive to being active rebels.
