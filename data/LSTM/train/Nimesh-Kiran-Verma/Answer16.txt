If we were lucky  our caregivers mostly did meet our needs. In no case  though  can a caregiver read an infant's mind. As everyone who has ever been a parent - or an infant - knows  parents' inability to mind-read is alone responsible for plenty of unnecessary tears and suffering. In virtually no case does a caregiver give an infant everything he or she wants. In virtually no case are the infant's desires the only causes of the events in his or her life.The Secret promises that if we can learn to ask and receive  then the Universe can be the idealized parent we never had - a parent who can read our minds and provide us with everything we want.Be careful what you wish for.
