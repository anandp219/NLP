It was the 12th summer of my life when I was at my grannys village. I went along my father and few of his friends for an evening walk in the farmlands. After walking a few kilometers out of the village  I was exhausted. My father advised me to wait for him under the banyan tree beside the lake  the spot which we crossed few minutes before  as it is safe  till he comes back.I agreed and headed towards the tree.Exhausted as hell  I lied on my back and started watching the sky which was changing its colors towards the darker shades of orange and within few minutes the stars came out.This was the first time in my life I was all aloneall left to myself.No human soul around for a at least a km.
