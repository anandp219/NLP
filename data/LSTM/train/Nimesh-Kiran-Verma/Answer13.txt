That too.The law of attraction  sadly  is not only a causal claim; it might be an unfalsifiable one.Consider this: what if you don't get what you want after thinking and thinking about thinking about it? Does that prove that The Secret doesn't work? No  because maybe didn't think enough about it  or you thought too many negative thoughts  or you didn't give the universe enough time to deliver it to you.Yet why let the absence of proof stop me when The Secret offers infinite benefits? Why not follow Pascal's famous rationale for believing in God: if there is any chance that God is real  I have much more to gain by believing in him than I have to lose by not believing.
