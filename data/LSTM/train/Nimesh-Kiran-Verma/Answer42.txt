  I believe  it is in the loneliness you speak to yourself !In my childhood days I used to be an introvert kid and therefore for the obvious reasons not at all popular. I used to be that plain vanilla boy who would sit in the middle benches of his class room and would endure the urgency of using washroom for hours but couldnt stand up and seek permission from teacher. The times I broke my silence was when I had any emotional rush...Which was usually when I was hurt over someones remark or teasing.Yes I was like one of those shy classmate of yours.. whom you fail to recognize every time you see your old class photograph.I continued to be this till I was about 10-11 years oldMe and my family went to my grandparents place ( about 700 km far ) every summer.
