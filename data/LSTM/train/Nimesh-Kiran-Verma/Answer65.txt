  Suppose that you were on your way to meet two close friends. Will you feel anxious or afraid of the meeting?Of course you wont but what if you were going to deliver a presentation in front of 100 persons that you dont know  wont you be afraid?Yes you will only be afraid if you have doubts about your ability to handle the presentation.We fear the future when we have doubts about our ability to handle future events.In the first instance this might look like something that is out of our hands but on careful observation you will find that we fear the future because we ignore getting prepared on intention.For example if you are afraid not to find a job then this means that you feel that you are not that prepared for the job market.
