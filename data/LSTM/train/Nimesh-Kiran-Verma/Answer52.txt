When he released "Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight" he turned colorful caricatures into complex personalities. With "The Prestige " he grabbed your attention the way a magician enthralls a child and his subtle sleight of hand tricked us anyway even though we know better. He's constantly reinventing the Blockbuster and actually creates something you could never have imagined. And he does it so well that it's impossible to decide which is better: the idea or the execution.His movies take me anywhere from the heights of Gotham to the depths of the human subconscious.
