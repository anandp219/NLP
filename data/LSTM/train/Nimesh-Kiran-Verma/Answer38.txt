  This will very short as I know about you and him !If you are sure that  you are strong mentally and spiritually.. Stay with him as a friend but remain aloof from the Ideas that you could lure him into love etc. If he loves you back in future  you are a lucky human! If not you still have a good friend to cherish!If you know ( you do  trust me !) it will kill you slowly Then run like hell away from him. This won't be selfishness  but rather protection from the gradual mental annihilation. Cogito Ergo Sum
