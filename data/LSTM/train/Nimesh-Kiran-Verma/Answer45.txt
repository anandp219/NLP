And more than the comforts of the hotel  Im enjoying my loneliness which again had made me realize that I talk too much and therefore should try to speak as little and concise as possible.A yet another life changing lesson!I think it is in the loneliness you speak to yourself !And me suggested me to be a spectator of life and not a commentator !
