On his way back he found an aged monkey blocking his path  since it was the custom not to cross a living person  Bheema  his thoughts still swollen with pride  called out loud to the monkey to clear the path. The feeble monkey told him that it was too tired  it requested the powerful warrior to move it's tail aside. An arrogant Bheema could not budge the tail though he tried with all his might. Realizing his folly he apologized to the monkey. Seeing his arrogance quelled  the monkey returned to its original form; it was none other than Lord Hanuman who had come to subdue the pride of his brother.Hanuman told Bheema  after the above-mentioned incident that he would appear on the flag of Arjuna's chariot.
