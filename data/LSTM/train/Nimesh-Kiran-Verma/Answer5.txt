Krishna after burning Kalyavana to death had captured his soul (tied him in a knot of his upper cloth) and taken him to Dwaraka only to stuff him into a cupboard. Ghatotkacha(who had been sent by Hidimba to take care of Subhadra in Dwarka as Pandavas were in the forest.) saw Krishna and got a scolding from him. He went and reported the matter to Subhadra who went downstairs to check. She opened the cupboard and a light entered her womb which caused her to fall unconscious. This was the main reason why Krishna divulged only half the secret of Chakravyuha to Abhimanyu when he was in the womb."
