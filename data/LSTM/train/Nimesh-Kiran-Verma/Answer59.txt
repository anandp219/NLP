  Best is to see the beauty in the philosophy they follow to live their life.Each one of us give some time to think about our insignificant life on the face of this huge planet  which is just a mere spec over time.And subconsciously realize that  what actually matter is the idea or the thought process which shapes our life what it is!So I personally think that the true and best in thinking about a person is their hidden philosophy of life.Following monologue from the movie V for Vendetta is simply a jewel of perfection and every time I go through it I feel the real pain of the fictional Valarie and can't help myself appreciate her philosophy...I know theres no way I can convince youthis is not one of their tricks but I dont care.I am me.My name is Valerie.I dont think Ill live much longer andI wanted to tell someone about my life.This is the only autobiographythat I will ever write and God I dont remember much of those early years but I do remember the rain.My grandmother owned a farm in Tottle Brookand she used to tell me thatGod was in the rain.Her name was Sarah.It was her wrists  they were beautiful.I thought we would love each other for ever.I remember our teacher telling usthat it was an adolescent phasethat people outgrew.I didnt.In 2002  I fell in love with a girl named Christina.I couldnt have done it without Chris holding my hand.My mother said nothing.But Id only told them the truth.Was that so selfish?Our integrity sells for so little  but it is all we really have.It is the very last inch of us we are free.Id always known what I wanted to do with my life and in 2015 I starred in my first film The Salt Flats.It was the most important role of my life not because of my career but because that was how I met Ruth.The first time we kissed We moved to a small flat in London together.
