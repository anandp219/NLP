Once when the Pandava's were resting in the forest  a heavenly flower by name Sugandikapushpa floated through the air into the lap of Draupadi. Totally enchanted by its beauty and fragrance she asked Bheema to get some more flowers for her. Thus Bheema went in the direction in which the flower had flown. He found it in a lake belonging to Gandharvas (the court musicians of Lord Indra)  after a fierce battle he was able to obtain the flowers. Thus triumphantly  Bheema headed back  proud of his strength.
