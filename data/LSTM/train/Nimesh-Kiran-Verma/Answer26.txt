But I will relate the second story because it is here that Hanuman actually meets Lord Krishna. In an argument between Hanuman and Arjuna  Arjuna claimed that he could reconstruct the bridge built by the Vanar army during Lord Sriram's war with Ravana using his archery skills. Hanuman laid the challenge that if Arjuna could build a bridge that could withstand his weight  let alone an army's  then he would be on the flag of Arjuna's chariot in the war. But should Arjuna fail it was decided that Arjuna would give up his life by entering a pyre.
