  I would like to share my experience about dreaming  which in a way would help you get a little closer to the answer you seek.Sleeping and dreaming are few of many weird hobbies I haveMany time I have slept for straight 18-20 hours.You would surely like to know the reason behind it.Its' because I enjoy the dreams which dawn upon me  when I sleep.Each of the dream  I get are very much like a movie which builds upon the thoughts I was engrossed in before sleep or sometime before.Also as I live in hostel  there is always some sound hitting my ear drums  and many times it happens that my dreams get woven around these inputs.I once  some how overheard my friend fighting with his girl on phone while sleeping  and I dreamt about my breakup ( the fun fact being  I don't have any girlfriend).So I believe the inputs which we receive conscious/subconsciously while sleeping  shape our dreams alot.Here the link to my blog depicting such weird experiences of mineCogito Ergo Sum
