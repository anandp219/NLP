As we know  Wolverine's skeleton is coated with adamantium: the adamantium coating around his bone claws might also be thinner than that around the rest of his skeleton.Of course  Wolverine's declawing also made it easier for Yashida to extract the healing factor from Logan - since he had lost his main weapon.SymbolismWolverine's losing his claws is very interesting and potent imagery as he is strongly identified with his adamantium claws. It is interesting that he regenerates his bone claws - which he hasn't seen/used for almost 4 decades - and uses them to finish Yashida off.The loss of the adamantium claws (which have been on him from 1979 to 2013 [according to Timeline])  his near death at Yashida's hands and his Triumph the return of his bone ones can be seen as representing:Castration - he has lost the symbol of his Potency and his main Weapon/ToolThe Symbol of the Woman - Loner that he is  Wolverine has had many tragic relationships with women.
