  A basic definition of religion would be to follow Edward Burnett Tylor:Religion is a belief in spiritual beings.In this case  feminism is not a religion since it does not talk about the spirit world.Nonetheless  it has many characteristics of a religion  and specifically a religion in the Judeo-Christian tradition  among which are:- The concept of (Original) Sin surfaces as that of Male Privilege  which is something that can never be fully cleansed and for which one must feel guilty (John Scalzi  "white male privilege"  and original sin)- It has a bogeyman that is blamed for everything that is wrong in this world.
