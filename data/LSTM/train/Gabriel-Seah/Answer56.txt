/ Peter KreeftIn Christian art  angels have been portrayed as both male and female  depending on the context  but this is how they are perceived/reveal themselves  rather than revealing their "true gender" (so to speak).Judaism seems to be a bit more complicated  with angels being seen as androgynous in some thought systems and as male-female pairs (syzygies) in others (The Kabbalistic Teachings of Jesus in the Gospel of Thomas / Lewis Keizer).Similarly  God is neither male nor female  as these are earthly concepts that do not apply to the realm of the divine.
