  Most anti-hunting sentiment is due to a combination of:- romanticisation of charismatic megafauna- thinly-disguised bashing of rich people- generalised online misanthropyThe reaction to the killing of Cecil the Lion is no exception  and is similar to past reactions when Ian Gibson was trampled to death by an elephant (Game Hunter Trampled To Death By Elephant)  Rebecca Francis killed a giraffe (This woman smiled after shooting a giraffe  and the Internet is outraged) and Kendall Jones posted pictures of herself smiling beside dead African game (Uproar over cheerleaders trophy hunts posted on Facebook).Perhaps there was some slight increase in outrage due to the hunt being illegal and Cecil being famous  but really how many non-Zimbabweans had heard of Cecil before his killing  and why does legal hunting also upset people?Let us look at some of the reasons typically given to justify outrage at this kind of hunting and hunter: conservation  animal cruelty and sportsmanship.ConservationCecil was a member of the species Panthera leo  the African Lion  which is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Panthera leo (African Lion  Lion)).That might sound worrying  but Gadus morhua (Atlantic Cod) is also Vulnerable (Gadus morhua (Atlantic Cod  Cod  Codling  Haberdine  Kil'din Cod)) and most people have no problems with eating it.
