Feminism  which has a skeptical attitude to marriage and sometimes views it as an institution which oppresses women  would mean that feminist women are less favorable to marriage than non-feminist women.Other factors which lead to divorce are "marrying at a very early age  less education and income  living together before marriage  a premarital pregnancy  no religious affiliation  coming from a divorced family  and feelings of insecurity" (Page on usu.edu). Feminist women are likely to qualify on many of these criteria (and not to qualify in others)  but in these cases it is not their being feminist per se that leads to the divorce  but factors correlated with their being feminist.
