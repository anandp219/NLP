  There're 2 ways to look at this question: story logic and symbolism.Story LogicWithin the logic of the movie The Wolverine  the amputation of Wolverine's claws seems to be necessary for The Silver Samurai aka Yashida to extract Logan's healing factor.After Wolverine's claws are amputated  tiny drills extend from The Silver Samurai's suit and pierce his stumps  and the healing factor is extracted from him.Notably the tiny drills did not penetrate his skin - which would be easier to breach  being softer and more accessible than his stumps; just imagine how easy it would have been if Yashida had just needed to poke Wolverine anywhere (perhaps in the butt) and suck his healing factor.Perhaps the healing factor resided in his bones and accessing them through his claw stumps was the easiest way to penetrate his bones  since Yashida wouldn't have needed to work his way through flesh before hitting the bone.
