  Some rape victims report that their vaginas produced lubrication during the episode.In one study  up to 21% of rape victims reported "physical arousal" (which should include lubrication since that is one of the earlier signs of arousal)  and about 5% reported orgasming from sexual abuse (How the Body Reacts to Sexual Assault )It is hypothesised (Page on centenary.edu) that women's vaginas produce lubrication whether sex is wanted or unwanted  in order to protect them - traumatic (rough) sex causes more damage when there's no lubrication than when there is.
