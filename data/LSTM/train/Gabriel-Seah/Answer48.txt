Yes  almost everyone complains about immigration nowadays  but it is plausible that it has effects even on the young.Immigration is not just limited to the working population. Students from all over Asia now study in Singaporean schools - not just the good schools but also the not-so-good ones.Foreign students are mostly very hard-working. After all they have come from a foreign country (and since they come from Asia  many are from poor backgrounds) and so make the most of their chances and study really hard.
