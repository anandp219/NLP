If a story sounds too "good" to be true  it probably is.And then  you can do several things:- Write in to the publication to complain. Make your voice heard as a reader. At the very least this will annoy them.- Post the truth in the comments section. Heartwarmingly  the 4th and 5th comments on the Gawker post highlight how misleading it is and present the critical information we need to fully evaluate this story.- Recommend/like/promote/upvote comments by others which highlight the truth.- Comment when friends share these stories (since these stories are made to be shared so as to get more views and thus ad revenue).
