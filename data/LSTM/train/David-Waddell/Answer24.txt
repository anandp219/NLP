  I continue to use the word migrants because in my view it seems to be both the most neutral and broadest term - including immigrants  emigrants  legal and illegal migrants  asylum seekers and refugees.Very often it's unclear precisely which category the latest migrants fall into  and it would be a mistake to label them refugees until they've been legally afforded that status. In many cases  while some of them might well be able to claims asylum  they choose not to do so  and assume for themselves the attitude of economic migrants  seeking to settle in Germany or the UK  for example  rather than in the first state they arrive in upon fleeing conflict or persecution.I understand that many people feel the term 'migrant' is pejorative.
