  So as the wind blows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure  so people will flow from areas of hardship to a place they perceive will bring them more safety and/or prosperity.The migrant crisis essentially includes both migrants and refugees. The legal distinction between them is clear. I see migrants as people who are on the move  particularly between nations and particularly on a semi-permanent basis.According to the Geneva Refugee Convention  refugees are:"A person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race  religion  nationality  membership of a particular social group or political opinion  is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or  owing to such fear  is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who  not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events  is unable or  owing to such fear  is unwilling to return to it.
