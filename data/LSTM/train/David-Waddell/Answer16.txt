  The Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition is given a salary equal to that of a Cabinet Minister. None of his or her shadow ministers receives any special remuneration beyond their MP's salary.It is highly likely that the new Labour leader will be formalised as leader of the opposition imminently  though whether he would self-identify or be identified as 'loyal' is unlikely. It may be that he does not or cannot take that title formally  even though he leads the largest opposition party in that House of Commons.Due to the nature of his 'friends' and associates  it is unlikely he would be brought into the Prime Minister's confidence on matters of national security in the way that other opposition leaders have been honoured for many years.
