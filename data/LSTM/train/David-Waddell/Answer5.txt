Now... you may not agree with some of the ideas outlined above. You may think some of the measures don't go far enough  or that we should thank other parties for some of the policy measures currently in play. But they are currently being delivered by the incumbent government  and they are widely (if not unanimously) supported by the MPs of the governing party.I have my bugbears about MPs right across the political spectrum  but I contend that literally no-one goes into politics to crush the souls of the poor  and virtually all MPs have a sympathetic understanding of the plight of their constituents  particularly the poorest and most troubled who fill their surgeries.Conservative solutions and those of the OP may be very different.
