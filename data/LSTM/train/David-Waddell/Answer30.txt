  The BBC didn't say this  though we may have reported the ambitions expressed by ISIS. In fact I cannot find a link even to that reportage  although I see it elsewhere.Is it realistic? I think it is important never to rule out scenarios entirely. Let's measure them all with probability. I won't put a figure on it  but I think it's highly improbable that ISIS's territory will expand much beyond its present borders. Certainly as they press north into Turkey they will find the full might of Nato upon them.
