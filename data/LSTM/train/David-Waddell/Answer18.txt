For me  Mac Tan's answer hits the nail on the head  with regard to the impact of the #BlackLivesMatter campaign and how it's been handled by Hillary.She has  it would seem  the luxury of being able to focus a little further ahead towards the main presidential contest  because she's picked up such a huge virtual* lead in the primary contest. In fact  it may even help her credibility in the primaries if she's seen as a potential general election winner. At the moment she looks more likely than anyone else  Democrat or Republican to be installed as the USA's 45th President in January 2019.
