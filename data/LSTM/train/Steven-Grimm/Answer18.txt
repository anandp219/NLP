They're just part of the pronunciation  not an extra thing on top of the pronunciation.Get them wrong in a way that isn't typical of a well-known regional variation in native-speaker pronunciation and your listener might be able to figure out what you meant to say  but you'll be forcing them to do more work to understand you. And they'll guess wrong  or completely fail to come up with a possible interpretation  some percentage of the time.
