And that'll probably be whichever language has tutorials or books you find most closely suit your learning style.My advice: pick four or five popular languages and Google for beginner tutorials in each. Give each tutorial a few hours of your time and then continue pursuing whichever one you enjoy most or makes you feel like you're learning the most. You may end up switching to another language later in your learning process but you'll have had a good taste of the pleasure of the craft and will have learned some basics that'll help you get a running start later.
