That kind of thing is hard to do without local help. But to me that's distinct from just hiring a general-purpose local guide to take me around.That said  there are some places that are impractical (if not impossible) to visit without a guide  and I'll use one in those cases. For example  if I'd tried to do a solo visit to North Korea instead of a guided one  you would probably be reading news stories about my imprisonment!
