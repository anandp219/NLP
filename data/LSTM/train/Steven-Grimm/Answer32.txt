When this is done over the course of multiple syllables  it's pretty obvious what's going on and the listener still hears it in terms of the expected per-syllable tone changes.Of course  there are also other ways to include extra information in speech  e.g.  changing the speed of your speech  speaking louder or dropping to a whisper  or pausing between words. All of those kinds of things work just as well in Mandarin as in English or any other language.As always  I welcome corrections from native speakers; the above is my understanding as someone who is still learning the language.
