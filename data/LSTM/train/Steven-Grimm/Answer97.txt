When I was going to school in China there was a hamburger place around the corner owned by an American expat.That said  the Chinese diaspora is large enough and has been going on long enough that there are some interesting and unique things about the Chinese restaurant world. In a lot of ways it forms a distinct sector of the economy. For a great history of overseas Chinese food  I highly recommend Jennifer 8. Lee's book "The Fortune Cookie Chronicles." You will learn all about the pipeline of people moving from Fujian province to the United States to work in restaurants (there's a network of people in both the USA and China who work the immigration system to keep the supply of new arrivals flowing)  about the reasons so many Chinese restaurant menus in the USA look identical to one another (there's a company that sells them!)
