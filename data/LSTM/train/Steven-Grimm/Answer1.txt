  As of the midseason finale of year two of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  they seem to be going full steam ahead with a version of the Inhumans backstory that follows the comics pretty closely  from the presence of the Kree on ancient Earth to the use of Terrigen Mist to the presence of buried ancient cities.Clearly this has been the plan since long before an Inhumans movie was announced  since it's the culmination of a bunch of previously dangling plot threads that were laid out practically from the start of the show.The rights issues between Marvel and other movie studios will necessarily change the details to some degree  e.g.  by removing X-Men-style mutants from the equation and (though there's some ambiguity here) preventing the use of the Skrull.
