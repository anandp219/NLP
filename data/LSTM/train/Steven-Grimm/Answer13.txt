This was the first full book I ever read in Chinese  though it's a pretty short one.The Chinese Breeze series consists of books at a few different skill levels  starting at about a 300-word vocabulary.Once you're at a point where you can read the Chinese Breeze books reasonably well  I recommend ditching the "for beginners" requirement and getting some native-speaker reading material whose subject matter is of interest to you. For example  I'm currently on book three of Liu Cixin's "Three-Body" series  which is considered by a lot of people to be the best science-fiction trilogy to come out of China.
