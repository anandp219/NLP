  He's neither a Democrat nor a Republican nor a member of any other United States political party. And I don't mean that in the obvious literal sense. The politics of North Korea (to the extent they're understood by the outside world) simply aren't analogous to the politics of any western democracy. The history is different  the external pressures are different  the internal conflicts are different  the government and political structures are different.Trying to describe any North Korean leader as belonging to a particular political party of a particular foreign country  even in a vague metaphorical sense  is an exercise in meaninglessness.Anyone who tries to make such a connection is almost certainly attempting to play a rhetorical trick on you  trying to stir you to partisan fervor without actually saying anything of any substance at all.
