  I'm going to assume the "early" here refers to the original pre-reboot run of the show rather than to the very earliest black-and-white episodes with the First Doctor.In terms of production values: the original is far worse  sometimes laughably so. That's part of the charm for the most part  though occasionally it distracts from the stories.In terms of storytelling: it varies. The first two Doctors' stories would for the most part be considered far too slow-paced by today's standards; even as a fan I find it a chore to watch some of them.
