Whenever anyone asks me where they should go on their first visit to China  my answer is Beijing.Best place to hang out: Dalian. Dalian doesn't have the best scenery  its history has interesting bits (mostly to do with its Russian and Japanese past) but nothing too spectacular  and the food is about average for a city of its size. What it has  though  is a much more relaxed  friendly feel than most other Chinese cities I've visited  plus much less air pollution than other coastal cities and a lot of nice green spaces.
