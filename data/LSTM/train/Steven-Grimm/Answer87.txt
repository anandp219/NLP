  Even today you don't have to search too hard on the Internet to find humans who are sexually attracted to nonhuman organisms of all different shapes and sizes. It's almost certain that at least a handful of the billions of members of the human race would find just about any kind of alien a sexual turn-on. Those people might be considered sexual deviants by most of humanity  but the attraction would still exist.The "mutual" part would depend on the aliens. For one thing  it would require that they reproduce sexually; if they have no ability to feel sexual attraction at all  then by definition they couldn't be mutually attracted to humans.
