The first two of those are both very commonly used.The target market is really pretty narrow -- this wouldn't be useful to anyone except beginning learners of Chinese  and even then  for educational materials you'll typically want to format the pinyin separately from the characters anyway so as to have proper word spacing. The correct pinyin for  is "pngyu" and not "png yu " but if the Latin characters were attached to the Chinese ones  you'd have no ability to control that spacing.However  it should be possible to take an existing Chinese font and write software to alter it based on the pronunciations from a Chinese dictionary.
