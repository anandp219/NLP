And when the story described the global reaction to certain major events  I found myself having to suspend my disbelief pretty strongly: it's hard to imagine there wouldn't have been huge numbers of escape attempts in the second and third books  for example.In general I give the series a thumbs up  but don't expect it to be the most amazing thing you've ever read.
