You probably are  and you probably don't even have to make a conscious effort to do it. It's the same with Mandarin: the language imposes some structure on your intonation but within that structure you still have plenty of room to add all the nuance you want.Since the language's tonality is based on relative changes in intonation within a word  it's also possible to say an entire word or phrase at a higher or lower pitch (but still use the proper tone contours within the word) to convey information.Where it departs from English a little bit  and takes a bit of practice as a learner  is when you use intonation to indicate a question.
