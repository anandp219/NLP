In several places the story is advanced by extremely convenient coincidences and by characters making massive intuitive leaps that haven't been previously hinted at.That said  the story also has some delightful twists and turns  and I often had no idea where it was going to go next. Each of the three books has a hook that makes it pretty unusual  if not unique  in the genre: the Cultural Revolution setting of the first book  the very slowly ticking doomsday clock of the second book  and the migrations in the third book.The non-western cultural perspective has a big impact on the story.
