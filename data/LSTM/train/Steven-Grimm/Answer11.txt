"There are some consonant shifts that happen a lot of the time but not all the time:"ch" becomes "c" --  is read  "ho c" rather than  "ho ch. ""sh" becomes "s" --  and  are pronounced the same. "zh" becomes "z" --  is read  "znglng" rather than  "zhnglng. "The "r" sound is often not enunciated. comes out sounding like the English word  "Uh." I remember when I'd just met my wife and she told me the price of something was $22  she said  "h s h kui" and  having only learned the putonghua pronunciation  I had no idea what she meant.I welcome corrections or clarifications from native speakers; these are just the main differences I've personally observed.
