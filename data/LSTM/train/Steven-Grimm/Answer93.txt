   makes much more sense to me as the character for "tear" than . Water + eye = teardrop. Water + door + dog = a wet dog entering the house? (Though as John Renfroe notes in his comment  the right side of the traditional character is actually a phonetic component  not a semantic one. )But "inferior" is totally subjective and depends on which criteria you personally consider important. Simplified characters are often faster and easier to write  so if that's important to you  then lots of them will seem superior to their traditional counterparts.
