From a western reader's point of view  this is both for better and for worse. The "better" is largely that the story avoids some of the tropes of western science fiction  and some of the characters have viewpoints and decisionmaking processes one doesn't encounter often in western SF. The "worse" is that the story has characters from all over the world  and the non-Chinese characters sometimes act kind of bizarrely  betraying the same kind of lack of understanding that often causes western writers to stumble when they try to write Asian characters.
