Traveling with a guide also adds pressure to be in social interaction mode all day long every day  which becomes increasingly exhausting and stressful for introverts like me as a trip progresses. Often I want to walk around looking at my surroundings without talking to anyone.I'll sometimes go on 1-day guided tours of particular places when I travel  especially special-interest tours where I would have a hard time making the arrangements on my own. For example  in Buenos Aires earlier this year I went on a guided street-art tour where the guide knew a bunch of the local artists and took us to meet some of them and watch them work.
