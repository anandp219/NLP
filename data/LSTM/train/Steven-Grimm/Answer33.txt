  Starting with Portal or any other game that plays like a first-person shooter might be a mistake for a couple reasons. First  the controls are likely to be frustrating for someone who has absolutely no experience coordinating mouse movement with the direction of movement and view. Second  a significant percentage of people experience motion sickness from first-person-perspective games. This often diminishes with repeated exposure  but you don't want your friend's first gaming experience to be literally nausea-inducing.The first question I'd ask would be whether your friend plays any games that aren't computerized  e.g.  board or card games.
