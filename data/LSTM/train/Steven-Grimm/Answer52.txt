So memorizing definitions isn't enough; you need to know how the words are put together in actual use. For example  if you have a flashcard that helps you memorize the fact that "" is the Chinese word for "to be " that won't help you remember that Chinese doesn't always use the concept of "to be" the way English does; if you naively try to say  "He is hungry" using that word  the sentence will make no sense. If you read a lot  you'll come across the equivalent Chinese sentence enough times that you won't be tempted to write or say it the wrong way.Flashcards also don't help you smoothly recall words in context  which is vital for conversation.
