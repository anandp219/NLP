  It's more a function of child physiology than of loan words.Babies can only make a limited number of sounds at first because they don't have fine motor control. "Ma" and "ba" and "pa" are the words for mother and father in a lot of languages because they're the first word-like sounds babies are able to make when they babble  and parents want to believe that the first words out of a baby's mouth refer to the parents rather than just being random vocalizations.Mama and papa on Wikipedia has a bit more detail.
