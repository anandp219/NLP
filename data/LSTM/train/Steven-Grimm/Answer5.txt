Quora could add the ability to follow and mute anonymous users in a way that wouldn't reveal their identities. If that ability existed  much of my dislike would go away. But it doesn't currently exist  and I can only form my opinion based on the current state of affairs.In cases where there's a solid reason for anonymity  e.g.  revealing information about people or companies or governments that would put you in danger  the benefit outweighs the cost. So clearly the anonymity feature serves a valid purpose.
