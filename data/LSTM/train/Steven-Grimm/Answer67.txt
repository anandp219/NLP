  With around 30 countries in my travel history  mostly visited solo but occasionally with guides  I've found I don't enjoy guided visits more than I enjoy the ones I do on my own or with a traveling companion. The experience with a guide is different  no question  but to me it's no better or worse on balance. I learn more in some respects and less in other respects. There's less frustration with a guide handling things  but for the same reason there's less sense of adventure and accomplishment.It's not just about itinerary flexibility  though I have yet to meet a guide who's well-suited to my preferred travel style of  "That street looks interesting -- let's go walk down it and see what's there" where there is literally no itinerary at all and I'm just kind of taking each day as it comes and moving on to the next place whenever I feel like it.By virtue of the guide knowing what they're doing  guided trips remove the possibility of screwing up and doing dumb things out of ignorance  which  while rarely pleasant in the moment  often turns into some of the best stories after the fact.
