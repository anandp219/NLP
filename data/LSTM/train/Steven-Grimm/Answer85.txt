There are good restaurants scattered around the city  but if you want an easy quick fix in the older part of the city  the shopping area underneath Victory Square has a food court with a large variety of different foods. A slightly more upscale  but still inexpensive  alternative would be the floor underneath the Wal-Mart near Olympic Square.
