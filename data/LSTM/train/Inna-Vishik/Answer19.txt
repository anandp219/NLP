Source: A collaboration of researchers in Japan report on four years of extensive research into superconductivity  including the materials that were found not to have superconducting properties  as well as those that were  and their potential for wires and devices. | JSAP BULLETIN | The Japan Society of Applied PhysicsSearching for high temperature superconductivity in hydridesRoom-temperature superconductivity has been predicted in metallic atomic hydrogen (which can only be achieved at very high pressures and has never been made in a lab) back in the 1960s.
