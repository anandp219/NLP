This sort of analysis was done by McMillan in 1968  and the maximum possible Tc was found to be 40K for specific superconductors that were known back then [1]. This paper has often become victim to a convoluted game of telephone where people got the idea that BCS superconductors could not have a Tc above 40K  which isn't the case.If you are thinking of a specific mechanism of superconductivity (lets stick with BCS since that is the only mechanism supported by a plurality of experiments on materials it claims to describe)  you can place limits on Tc based on the elements which exist on the periodic table.
