Heat dissipation is a big factor in success in distance running. Other important physiological factors are longer legs relative to the body height (for obvious reasons) and thinner ankles and calves (to decrease the energy required to swing the leg)  which successful Kalenjin runners appear to have. Additionally  being born and raised at altitude (but not too high altitude--8000 feet or so) is thought to confer advantages in the blood's oxygen carrying capability which cannot be replicated simply by training at altitude as an adult.See also: Running economy : the forgotten factor in elite performance.Feedback loopThere are some factors which require an input of one or two successful runners (in this case  it was Kipchoge Keino* in the 1960s)  which set of a cycle of excellence.
