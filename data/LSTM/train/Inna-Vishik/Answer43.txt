  There have been ~8 years in which the Nobel Prizes in Physics has been awarded for breakthroughs in superconductivity and closely related phenomena. Not to mention the many awards for experimental and theoretical techniques which are crucial for studying superconducting materials. Additionally  high temperature superconductivity is one of the most important unsolved problems in condensed matter physics (though not the only one; condensed matter is not defined by a singular problem  which makes it such a vibrant field).
