  There is nothing shameful about dropping out of a marathon. Powering through legitimate illness or injury on race day just to make it to the finish line (and the ER immediately afterwards) is much more foolish  and in my opinion  an action people should actually be ashamed about. In the absence of such an extreme situation  there is a lot of merit in dropping out after it is clear that you will fall far short of your racing goals  in order to save your legs for another race and/or more training.Elite runners drop out of races all the time because the damage they would do to their body by running an ill-fated race to completion is far worse than the embarrassment they would feel from failing to complete the race.
