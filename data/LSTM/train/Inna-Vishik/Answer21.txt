This is the highest transition temperature achieved in any material ever. Although this search was based on known physics  the predicted Tc of H2s was only 80K  so this high Tc was a discovery and a breakthrough indeed.Brief description of the science: Inna Vishik's answer to What is the mechanism of sulphur hydride's high-temperature superconductivity?Original paper: Page on nature.comFree version: [1506.08190] Conventional superconductivity at 203 K at high pressuresH2S was compressed in a diamond anvil cell to make a high temperature superconductor.
