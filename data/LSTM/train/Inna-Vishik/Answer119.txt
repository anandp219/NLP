  My advice is in the context of a race  intended for recreational runners who want to achieve good performance.TrainingIf you formally train for races  there are training plans available online  or you can hire a coach (in person or online). This is not necessarily a requirement for recreational runners. However  you should run to prepare for a running race (not bike  not elliptical  not swimming)  and you should not run an entire 5K at race pace during training. If you want to have 5K-pace running in your program  this should be in the form of shorter intervals (400m-1 mile).
