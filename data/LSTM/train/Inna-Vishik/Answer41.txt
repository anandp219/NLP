(see: Inna Vishik's answer to What is a d-wave superconductor vs. an s-wave superconductor? )To answer the original question  to the best of my knowledge people cannot predict a pairing symmetry just by knowing a superconducting material's Fermiology without any further information. Once they have further information from thermodynamic  spectroscopic  and magnetic probes  they can narrow down the possible pairing symmetries  which can then be confirmed by order-parameter sensitive probes (spin susceptibility measured by NMR Knight shift and specifically constructed Josephson junctions are the gold standards for ascertaining the spin and spatial component  respectively  but a myriad of other techniques exist when these are not possible for whatever reason).
