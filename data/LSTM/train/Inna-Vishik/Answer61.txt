Serendipity plays a role in all of science  from the high school teacher who inspired one's initial interest  to the university/lab they decided to join in their PhD  to the procedure that they randomly decided to do on tuesday which led them to discover the effect that they published in their paper. Thus  I don't see the merit of discounting serendipity. That being said  Nobel prizes span the full spectrum between accident and billion-dollar-deliberation. For example  the 1987 Nobel prize in physics (high temperature superconductivity) was for a serendipitious discovery (though the recipients might argue otherwise)  but you do not put 50 000 tons of ultra-pure water a half mile underground (Super-Kamiokande  part of the 2015 Nobel prize in physics) just to see if maybe something happens.Prizes de-emphasize replication and incremental progress.
