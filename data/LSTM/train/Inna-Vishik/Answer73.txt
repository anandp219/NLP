The analogy to Brownian motion is that a particle in a fluid will also tend to jostle around more when collisions are more probable: higher temperature and higher mobility of the particle. This analogy isn't just handwaving  it arises from the fluctuation dissipation theorem  which states that thermal fluctuations of a physical variable are directly related to impedance (dissipation) of the same variable. Stated in another way  viscous drag of a particle through a fluid arises from the same phenomenon which causes it to jostle when there is no external force applied: discrete collisions with fluid molecules.
