Experiments often fail  but (in academia at least) it is important to still have something to show. Sometimes this involves pivoting on the problem you are studying. For example  if you were trying to measure a tiny signal in system A  you might look for a system B with a larger signal  even if it is a bit less spectacular. It is good to have these sorts of backup plans when formulating a research problem. Sometimes making it work means changing your goals entirely. Instead of trying to measure a tiny signal in system A  you might write a paper about the upper limit of this tiny signal based on the capabilities (characterized by other means) of your experiment.
