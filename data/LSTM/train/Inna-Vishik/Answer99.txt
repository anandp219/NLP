When our vocal chords vibrate during speech  they produce multiple frequencies  and our voice box instinctively conforms to the correct dimension to produce the pitch we are seeking. When the cavity is filled with helium instead of nitrogen and oxygen  the vocal chords and voice box operate as usual  but the higher frequency sounds are amplified more because the speed of sound is nearly 3 times bigger in helium.
