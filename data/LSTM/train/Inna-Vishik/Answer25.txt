  In solids and liquids  heat can be transported by both atomic lattice vibrations (specifically  acoustic phonons on a crystalline solid  which generalize to sound waves in a liquid) or free electrons. In addition  liquids can support convective heat transfer.Liquids have lower thermal conductivity than solids because at the atomic scale  they are basically disordered solids. Disordered solids also have poorer thermal conductivity than solids with a high degree of crystallinity because acoustic phonons are scattered at imperfections such as lattice dislocations  impurities  and grain boundaries.
