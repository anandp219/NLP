  If you want to get good at running  you need to practice running  so 70 miles per week is far superior. The only exception is if you are very injury prone or if you simply don't like running that much.Cross training can mean different things. It can mean alternate aerobic activities such as biking or swimming. These will not help your running (because the impacts and biomechanics are so different) other than maintaining aerobic fitness in the case of injury. Another type of cross training is strength training  and this can indeed improve your running if the type and intensity of activities is chosen appropriately.
