Image source: This New Superconductivity Research StinksSearching for new and high temperature superconductors at interfaces between two materialsThe first two methods for searching for superconductivity--playing with materials chemistry and applying pressure--are fairly 'traditional' methods. A different approach is to create novel physics at the interface of two materials. One well-known system where this has worked is the interface between lanthanum aluminate and strontium titanate (LAO/STO)  where superconductivity has been discovered at 300 mK  even though both starting materials are semiconductors (review paper: Emergent phenomena at oxide interfaces).
