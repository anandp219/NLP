One specific example of a solid electrolyte is Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)(Y2O3+ZrO2)  the artist also known as cubic zirconia  where oxygen ions (or the vacancy thereof) can be conducted from one side of the crystal to another by applying a voltage (see images below). Normally  YSZ is transparent  but a different concentration of oxygen and/or oxygen vacancies can change the color by:changing the lattice parameters such that the band gap changesIntroducing 'color centers'--states inside the band gap which absorb light and give the material an increasingly brownish appearance as their concentration increasesReference: V.
