  As someone who works in condensed matter physics  but not specifically on graphene  I am a bit cynical about what is fascinating about graphene because I have heard every spiel 50 times before. A Dirac-like band dispersion? Okay  other materials do this too and have more fun with it. Potential applications in touch screens? Right  everything is transparent if it is one atom thick. An optoelectronic super-material? Call me when you scale the peak of the Gertner hype curve.The one finding that really intrigued me is related to local strains in graphene: gigantic pseudomagnetic fields.
