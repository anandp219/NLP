  In my field  I wouldn't characterize most papers as being badly written  though minor mistakes like typos are more common than in a typical newsstand magazine. Part of the explanation for decent writing is that there is a uniform structure for journal articles  so people do not attempt unique exposition techniques which they do not have the rhetorical agility to handle. Additionally  it is common for papers to be read carefully by several sets of eyes: the co-authors  a friend/colleague not on the paper  the referees  and sometimes the editor.For the papers where the two factors above do not produce a readable manuscript these are some reasons why:The paper was rushed  because of pressure from competing research groups or to meet a deadline.
