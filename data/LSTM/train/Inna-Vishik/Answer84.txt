As a journal referee  I read A LOT of papers in this stage of the revision process  and no referee who actually reads/cares lets a paper get published in an incomprehensible form. I suspect this factor is what plagues the CS papers in the answer details.Whoever wrote the paper is not a native speaker of English (assuming an English language journal obvi). This is where another set of eyes would be useful  but research groups based in other countries might not have access to native speakers  other than professional translation services.
