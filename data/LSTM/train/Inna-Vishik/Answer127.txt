  I would let it go  as long as the bad grammar doesn't creep into 'official' communications such as papers and grant proposals (and it almost certainly doesn't). Many professors mispronounce words or make grammar mistakes when they speak  and frankly  from the standpoint of a native speaker  it is not jarring and it does not make them sound less intelligent.My inclination to not correct English grammar mistakes comes from listening to other people (usually not native speakers) correct others' grammar in their presentations.
