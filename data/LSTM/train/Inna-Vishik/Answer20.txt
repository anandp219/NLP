Based on this prediction  together with an understanding of what causes conventional superconductivity in metals  a group in a Max Planck Institute has searched for many years for superconductivity in hydrogen-rich gases which have been metallized under high pressure (albeit not as high of a pressure as is needed to metalize atomic hydrogen). They had a modicum of success when they achieved superconductivity in pressurized silane (SH4)  but their big breakthrough came in the past year when they created a superconductor with a Tc of 203K by subjecting hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to very high pressure.
