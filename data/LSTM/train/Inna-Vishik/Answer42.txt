Notably  any technique which experimentally measures superconducting pairing symmetry is implicitly looking at the Fermi surface (even if they don't know what the Fermi surface looks like) because superconductivity only affects the electrons very close to the Fermi surface.This paper (free preprint here)is a nice example of using a material's fermilogy  together with information from other experiments  to argue for some pairing symmetries over others via process of elimination.
