I'm not sure how well professional translation services are equipped to implement some of the subtle exposition tricks used in scientific writing (e.g. "These data are not inconsistent with the following possible explanation...")Some papers are just so esoteric (even by the standards of basic research) that they probably won't be read/cited by many people. Why spend time perfecting these sorts of papers?
