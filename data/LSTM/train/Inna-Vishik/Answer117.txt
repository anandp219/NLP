When graphene is laid out on a substrate  it naturally exhibits bubbles  wrinkles  dimples  and other local distortions. A certain type of distortion--a triangular bubble--causes electron levels to be quantized in the same way that they would be if they were exposed to a magnetic field of hundreds of Tesla! * For comparison  the magnetic field in a MRI magnet is ~1 Tesla  the biggest DC field that can be produced in a lab is ~25 Tesla  and the biggest useful real magnetic field that can be produced in a lab is ~100 Tesla and this exists only for ~1 millisecond.
