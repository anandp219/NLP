and Inna Vishik's answer to What is the significance of the De Haasvan Alphen effect? )The pairing symmetry describes how the superconducting wavefunction transforms with respect to exchanging electrons. It has a spin and an orbital (spatial) component. The spin component is either singlet (Cooper pairs of opposite spin) or triplet (yes  this can happen too)  and the corresponding orbital component must be even for singlet pairing (s d g wave) or odd for triplet pairing (p f wave). The pairing mechanism (is superconductivity mediated by phonons or something else) is a distinct question  though certain pairing symmetries may favor one mechanism over another.
