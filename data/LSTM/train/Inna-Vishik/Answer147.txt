In all cases  the experimental setup has a lower temperature limit  and the sample is in thermal contact with a heater to raise it's temperature above this lower limit if needed. The amount of helium that an apparatus uses depends on several factors including: The quality of thermal insulation from the environmentThe thermal mass of the object one needs to cool downIs optical access required? At very low temperature  radiation is a big source of heating  so experiments which have a port to admit light will require more helium and will have a higher base temperature.The operation temperature and cooling procedure of the specific experimentTo throw some numbers out there  I have primarily worked with flow cryostats in experiments that required optical access  and one helium dewar (100 L) lasted 3-7 days at base temperature (5-10K).
