People work on high temperature sueprconductivity because it is a special problem in condensed matter physics which has enough richness of research problems and materials to sustain decades of activity--there is a lot of new physics to be learned***. In the relatively short time I have been an active researcher  I have seen other materials systems (and small sub-topics in high-Tc too) get discovered  become trendy  and get resolved all in a matter of a few years. Meanwhile  high-Tc perseveres as a source of deep research questions and field-specific research prizes.
