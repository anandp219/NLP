These numbers are not necessarily applicable to any arbitrary experiment  because of the factors listed above. However  it should be noted that helium is a non-renewable resource on earth (and it is completely asinine to mine He-4 in space)  so most labs try to conserve as much helium as they can. The best way to do this is to re-compress and re-use helium  and many labs/institutions are installing helium liquifiers (which typically use a bit of liquid nitrogen to condense impurities in the helium) to address the scarcity of this singularly important research tool.
