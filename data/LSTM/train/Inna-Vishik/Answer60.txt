In physics  the names of a few such prizes can be found here. These prizes are chosen by a jury of knowledgeable scientists (like the Nobel  and unlike some billionaire funded 'contests' which have emerged recently)  and many of them honor contributions to a given subfield over a long period of time  rather than a singular discovery  which may be a better metric of a scientific productivity.As for the article in the question details  I disagree with some of its points  maybe because I am a physicist  not a biologist.Prizes tend to honor serendipitous discoveries.
