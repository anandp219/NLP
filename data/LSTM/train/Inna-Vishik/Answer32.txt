  The NWM in SF is a clusterfuck for reasons that have nothing to do with the focus on women  namely  the lack of proper seeding with respect to projected finish time and the TNT people walking 10 abreast and blocking the entire roadway.Speaking more broadly to the idea of all women's road races  I am in no way against them  but the way they are usually implemented  they turn out to be a celebration of mediocrity. Some people take umbrage at all women's running events because of the girly flourishes--cheap jewelry  truffles  all pink everywhere.
