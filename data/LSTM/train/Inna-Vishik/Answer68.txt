Because LinkedIn is not particularly useful for academic careers  the LinkedIn profiles of academics tend to be less thoughtfully curated  and they are often just a copy/paste of their CV (which can stretch on for well over 10 pages for senior people). In academic CVs  words like 'investigated'  'studied'  and 'searched' count as action verbs  and the really brave among us will manually enter all their publications into an interface which was not meant to handle tens or hundreds of papers with multiple authors.
