Old school touch screens did/do operate by changing the distance between plates of a capacitor  which is why you had to press down hard 10-15 years ago. As such  modern touchscreens respond just fine to metal objects. I tried coins  keys  and bobbypins on my android  and the phone responded to all of them  though the gesture recognition algorithm seemed a bit confused at times.Touch screen mechanism is basically a parallel plate capacitor with (usually) ITO used in both plates. There is an additional external layer to protect the ITO from getting wiped off.
