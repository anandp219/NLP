This is not a strong function of which material you consider  but it is a strong function of the electron's kinetic energy after it received a kick from the photon (see image below). Using the 10eV kinetic energy  we get a distance around 1 nm. For a measure of how fast the electron is going  we can use the fermi velocity  which varies a lot among different materials. A typical value (give or take a factor of 10) is [math]10^5[/math] m/s. Thus  we get [math]10^{-14}[/math]s  or 10 fs  as the time it takes the electron to travel to the surface.Thus  we get 11.3 fs altogether for the time lag between arrival of photon and emission of photoelectron  for the particular experiment and materials parameters considered here.Inelastic mean free path of electrons in a solid (many different materials are compiled in this graph) in nanometers  as a function of the electrons' kinetic energy.
