  I get very excited for Nobel week every year  probably because this is a form of celebrity gossip which is socially acceptable among my cohorts. At the same time  it is pretty clear to anyone who does science thatmany important developments never receive a Nobel prizemany deserving scientists never receive a Nobel prize either because of politics or because of the limits on the number of people who can share onemany scientists (knowingly  eagerly) work on problems which are interesting and fundable but almost certainly won't yield a Nobel prizeNone of these points negate the value of big science prizes in general  but they do highlight the reasons that other research prizes exist and are considered very prestigious by practicing scientists.
