This is a courtesy to other racers  but you will benefit if you surround yourself by people going at a similar pace. If you are not sure where to stand  ask the people around you their projected finish time and move up/back accordingly.Pace yourself correctly. Do not sprint the first 200m like an 8 year old. You will likely achieve your optimal finish time if you run close to an even pace  assuming consistent terrain.Dress for the occasion. If it is 60 degrees outside  dress like it is 85  because you will get hot as you run.
