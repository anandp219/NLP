  It is hard to answer this question generally for every subfield/background  but I am a big fan of the Oxford Master Series in Physics. I am very impressed how they maintain such consistent pedagogical quality over so many subjects by various authors intended for various purposes (classroom textbook vs research reference). I have consumed the following books pretty much cover to cover  so I can vouch for them being engaging and relevant  if you are interested in the subfield to begin with:Statistical Mechanics: Entropy  Order Parameters and Complexity (Oxford Master Series in Physics): James P. SethnaSuperconductivity  Superfluids  and Condensates (Oxford Master Series in Condensed Matter Physics): James F. AnnettMagnetism in Condensed Matter (Oxford Master Series in Physics): Stephen BlundellOptical Properties of Solids (Oxford Master Series in Physics): Mark FoxBased on this sample  I wouldn't hesitate from purchasing any other books in this series.
