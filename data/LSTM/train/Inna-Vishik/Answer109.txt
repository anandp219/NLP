  The time lag is ~5-20 femtoseconds  depending on the energy of the photons and materials parameters of the metal. One femtosecond is [math]10^{-15}[/math] seconds or one quadrillionth of a second. This is super fast  but there are emerging experiments which can perform measurements on this time scale and faster (see: Attophysics). Below are details about where this time lag comes from.The photoemission process can be divided into three steps  each of which can be assigned a timescale.Electron receives energy kick from photonExcited electron travels to the surface of the materialElectron exits the material  losing energy equal to the material's work functionHow long does each of these steps take?Step 1: Like the well known momentum-position Heisenberg uncertainty relation  there is a similar one for energy and time.
