Metallic atomic hydrogen has never been achieved in the lab  but recently  researchers have been able to subject a compound containing a lot of hydrogen--H2S--to very high pressure in order to achieve the highest experimental Tc ever--203K [4]If you are thinking of a specific material or class of materials for which the mechanism of superconductivity is unknown  assessing a highest possible Tc can be quite tricky. An example of such a class of materials is the cuprate high temperature superconductors for which the highest Tc was measured to be 164K under high pressure (133K under ambient pressure) [5].
