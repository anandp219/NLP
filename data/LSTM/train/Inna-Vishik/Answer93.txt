If you are creating something novel (no pun intended)  you don't know what your next step is  and you might accomplish exactly nothing in three hours  other than collecting your thoughts. Not to mention how interruptions can further fragment the creative process. Instead  it might work better to prioritize project A for a period of time  say until an impending deadline  and prioritize project B for a period of time after that. For example  if you have an important presentation related to your PhD coming up  you should focus most of your time on that  and maybe use an hour or two in the evening for more 'brainless' activities related to your novel and programming  such as checking for typos and commenting your code.
