If there is any justice in the world it is that there has not been a 5th edition.The book is ~2-3x longer than it needs to be and could have benefited from some serious editing. There are only a handful of exactly solvable problems in quantum mechanics  so 840 pages is completely inappropriate for a first go-round. The book is fluffed up with numerous 'real world' examples which are too specialized for a general undergraduate physics audience.The first actual physics exposition comes in chapter 7  starting p 187.
