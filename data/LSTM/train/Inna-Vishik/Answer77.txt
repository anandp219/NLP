It is understandable if professors prefer to spend time on other things (teaching is not their main duty in a research university)  and as long as they rescale the scores as to not penalize students for this circumstance  no one is hurt.In many of my classes  there were people who were off-the-charts geniuses  but no people who were off-the-charts dunces. A very difficult exam can capture this side of the bell curve better.Bad:Some students will be discouraged  even if the grades are rescaled.The students who are not discouraged may internalize the notion that all difficult exams are meant to be unsolvable  which is a problem if a later course presents difficult looking problems which are meant to be solved completely.Not all difficult exams are created equally.
