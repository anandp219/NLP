Lets call the dimension of the cavity L (units=meters). For the case of the voice box  this is presumably varied by the phonal muscles  but keep in mind that our brain has internalized that a certain configuration is required to produce a given pitch. The speed of sound is denoted by [math]v_s[/math] (units = meters/second). Frequency is given by [math]v_s/L[/math] (units = 1/s)  so a higher sound velocity will favor higher frequencies for a given cavity size. The speed of sound is 349 m/s in nitrogen (our atmosphere is mostly nitrogen)  326 m/s in oxygen (good quantity of oxygen in there too)  and 1007 m/s in helium (see: Speed of Sound in Various Gases).
