  Sort of. Electrons in a metal undergo fluctuations which are mathematically similar to Brownian motion.There are several models to describe electrons in a metal. The simplest model is the Drude model  which treats electrons like a gas of classical particles which collide with each other leading to resistivity. Of course  electrons are quantum mechanical objects  and the next level of 'rigor' treats delocalized electrons as waves labeled by their momentum state. Further corrections introduce interactions between electrons and the ion lattice and electrons and other electrons.
