Similarly  the scattering events that an electron encounters as it traverses a metal under an applied voltage are the same scattering events it encounters in the absence of a voltage. The difference is that electrons are quantum mechanical  but this is one of the beautiful things about physics: sometimes you encounter very different systems which are described by the same mathematics.
