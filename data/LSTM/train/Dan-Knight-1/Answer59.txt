  Alexa Meade is an artist who uses Humans as her canvas. She turns them into living  breathing portraits. The effect is quite astonishing. The 28 year old made an impact on the art world when her works were featured on http://kottke.org/ (apparently one of the top influential blogs in the world). She quickly went viral because she has managed to create these reality distorting images despite having no formal training. She's recieved converage on CNN and various US national TV shows which came as a bit of of a shock.
