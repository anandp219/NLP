It automatically makes you look like an amateur. Drop something? Prepare for a room full of people turn round to stare at you  the noise of crockery smashing feels like it lasts for minutes.You have to look happy.

You have to interact with customers. I believe in this world you have the kind of people who choose to be back of house and those who prefer it out front.
