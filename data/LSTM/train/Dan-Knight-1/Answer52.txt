Unfortunately  as Corky becomes more successful  events take a turn for the worst  (spoiler) Fats takes control of proceedings and kills several people. Michael was at the point where Johnny was seeping into his private life and the person he was killing was himself. Alcohol (apparently two bottles of vodka before a gig) was the key to his success  but this obviously isnt the key to good physical and mental health. Michael was put into a box when Johnny came out to play  but it was Michael who had the final say.
