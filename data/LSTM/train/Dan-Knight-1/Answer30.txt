My mum told me I had to stop wearing mine after the world found out how combustible they were.Dummy necklace:Again  not know the drug connotation until much later  I had one of these necklaces. Being young and impressionable has a lot to answer for. Just because I wasnt old enough to go to raves didnt mean I couldnt wear the apparel (and paraphernalia it seems).Holographic sunglasses:During the 90s there was a holographic pandemic. Fashion was awash with a shiny  rainbow sheen. Everything from backpacks  to crop tops to shoes  to pencil cases were draped in space age holograms.
