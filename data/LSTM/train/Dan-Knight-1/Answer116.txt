Forever. Love could be a lot more fleeting. There was none of this looking-someone-up-after-a-few-years-of-singledom-to-see-they-are-now-successful-with-a-beautiful-girlfriend-and-a-child-on-the-way stuff. Which always makes everything a 100 times worse.So in conclusion (tl;dr): dating was simpler  yet hard work. Everything was more private  yet fleeting. You had to be more organised and creative.
