When my darling little munchkin decides the only way to rouse me is to either A) tickle my feet or B) jump on my tummy shouting daddy daddy its time to wake up!  my patience is a little Tested. Especially at 6am. The saving grace is he would have a nap in the afternoon  this means I could too (I mean  Im only 32  I thought afternoon naps were for old people Sadly no). The problem was compounded when I had the early start plus a day of working in a hot  pressured kitchen surrounded by knives. Many of them sharp.
