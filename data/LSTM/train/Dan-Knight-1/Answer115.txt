You could get up to absolutely anything and not be concerned about whether youd left your geolocation on by accident. You could effectively be unreachable from the second you left the house. This gave you an air of mystery  which is instantly desirable. There were no digital footprints (part 2). There was no scrolling through someones Twitter feed  no looking at past girl/boyfriends on Facebook  no WhatsApp last seens. You could meet someone randomly  have some fun and if  for whatever reason  you forgot their surname  that could be it.
