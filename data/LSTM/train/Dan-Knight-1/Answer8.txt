  There's several ways to transfer Android files to your Apple computer.1. Via USB with the official app Android File Transfer. 2. Via Wifi. I use an app called Airdroid.3. Using cloud storage such as Google Drive  Dropbox  Box etc.4. With a USB OTG (On The Go) cable. Used in conjunction with an app such as USB Host Controller or Total Commander you can connect a standard USB device to your Android device. Only some devices support it  so please download the free app USB OTG Checker.5. With a MicroSD card adapter.
