This Luseferous found particularly gratifying. Of late  the Archmandrite had a new play-mate to amuse himself with. A nameless would-be assassin whose own teeth were slowly killing him. The assassin  a big  powerful-looking  leoninely human had been sent without weapons save for his specially sharpened teeth  with which  it had obviously been hoped by whoever sent him  he could bite out the Archimandrites throat. This he had attempted to do  a half-year earlier at a cerimonial dinner. The failed assassin had been both routinely  if savagely  tortured and then very carefully questioned under the influences of entire suites of drugs and electro-biological agents  but had given nothing useful away.
