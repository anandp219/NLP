You can see cast members squirm under the ruthless  foul mouthed heart and soul of the show: Malcolm Tucker - Peter Capaldi (AKA Dr. Who).The show was created by Armando Iannucci after arguing the case for Yes Minister as best British sitcom. A limited budget was granted and a short three episode series aired on BBC4 in 2005. Popularity grew quickly and the show flourished into 4 series  plus special episodes and a spin off film called In The Loop. The series has been the recipient of a number of awards  particularly from BAFTA.
