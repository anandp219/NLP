Things werent so easy in the 90s  especially if you met someone in a pub or club. Youd have to rely on rumours  which is never a good thing. You had limited sex education. Nowadays you can find instructional videos in seconds. Back then  sex education was either via an embarrassed teacher putting a condom on a banana  daytime educational shows on TV (oh the sheer joy of turning on Channel 4 after pulling a sickie and looking at drawings of female anatomy)  rumours from your friends (never a good thing) or finding a porn mag in a hedge.
