This seems comepletely out of line with the My Little Pony ethos. Just take a look at this page: Twilights lack of knowlege has killed friendship! The sheer amount of peril in this one page would be quite daunting to those of a nervous disposition. The fear and terror in their eyes wouldn't be out of place in a Judge Dredd comic. The puns are weak  the peril is far too strong  the defeatest  pessimistic attitude of the some of the ponies is  at certain points  just too much to bear. It's far too departed from the My Little Pony I remember growing up as a child in the 80s and 90s.
