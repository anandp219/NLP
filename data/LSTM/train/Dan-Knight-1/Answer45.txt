  The general consensus of this thread is yes  some restaurants (eateries  if you will) allow people to eat leftovers  so Ill add my two cents.I worked somewhere in which a front of house was continually eating the leftovers. Fine  right? No  because he was eating leftovers straight off the customers plate as soon as he entered the kitchen. Ew. These were the thoughts running through my head (as well as trying to keep control of the kitchen and the team):1) Thats disgusting.2) Who knows where that customer has been.
