Theres little chance of getting away from prying eyes. There maybe more jobs  but there is also more people applying for jobsSecurity. The cities are home to digital prying eyes too - CCTV. If you have nothing to hide  personally I dont see it as a bad thing  but many people do.Cost Of Living. Expenses are high in the city. Owning or even renting a centrally located home can be many times more expensive than the rural counterparts (this is despite an increase in wages). Even living on the outskirts and commuting into the city centre can mount up over the course of a year (Oyster cards for zones 1-6 in London cost 2344 annually).
