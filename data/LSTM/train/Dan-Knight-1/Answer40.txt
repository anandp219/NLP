  Okay  so I've been through this rather substantial thread and I'm quite bored of seeing the Silence Of The Lambs poster and how it relates to Salvador Dal. I like to think I have an eye for aesthetics and that's the point of a film poster - to catch the eye. Here are four film posters that caught my attention which aren't fan-art reworkings.The Truman Show (1998)This is one of my favourites - Jim Carrey. From a distance the poster depicts just a happy go lucky guy wearing a suit staring off into the distance with a sense of happiness and contentment.
