In some ways being homeless in the countryside is easier than the cities. You can find fresh  clean water. Living off the land is achievable (whether its stealing from farmland or growing your own veg  fishing  setting traps for rabbits  mice  birds etc). Theres privacy  no one cares about what you look like and what you do because there is no one there to care about what you look like and what you do. You can become at one with nature.There are fewer serious crimes. Murder is a rarity  when it happens  its big news  it sends the community into a state of shock.
