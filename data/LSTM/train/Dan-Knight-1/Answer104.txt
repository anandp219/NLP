  Whenever I think virgin  I think.. I mean  he has a virgin group! That's something to be proud of. I doubt he has his actual virginity intact  what with his two children. The first real virgin who sprung to mind was Mother Teresa. The Nobel Prize winning Catholic nun of Albanian origin  gave up her life to religion from the age of 12. She is one of the greatest humanitarians who ever lived. In 1950 she started her own mission called Missionaries of Charity. The work of this organization has spread all over the World.
