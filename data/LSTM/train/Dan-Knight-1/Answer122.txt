  Recently I was lucky enough to go the UK national fireworks competition  it was pretty spectacular. In fact  it was the best firework displays Id seen. Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang  has taken the humble firework display a step further by using gunpowder as a medium to create innovative art. A few months ago  he realised a project 21 years in the making. To pay tribute to his grandmothers 100th birthday  he utilised a giant balloon to create a 1 650 ft pyrotechnic sky ladder.Cai Guo-Qiang was also responsible for the spectacular Beijing Olympic opening ceremony in 2008.
