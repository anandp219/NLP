I even remember my crisp packets were holographic. There seems to be some degree of 90s fashion revival at the moment  so I feel like I could wear most of these things again. Not because they look good - the 90s had some horrendous fashion disasters - but because they now have a certain level of retro appeal. I know I could walk out of my house in full 90s garb and garner some level of respect (or ridicule  I havent decided which).http://jnco.com/product-category...http://www.ebay.co.uk/bhp/alpha-...http://www.amazon.co.uk/KangaROO...http://www.for-sale.co.uk/shell-...https://www.etsy.com/uk/market/p...http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html...
