You get used to groups of people crowding round to watch their food being made. Multitasking looks impressive when its busy.You hear indirect feedback. I love the wow factor - When a customer receives the food youve just spent 20 minutes to prepare and you hear wow or wow thats amazing. Better yet  they take a photo. That photo goes on to social media and turns into free advertising for your restaurant.You know when youre about to get busy. This is a blessing. You can see new customers; you can measure how busy youre going to get and for how long.
