The Private Psychedelic Reel is the perfect way to end a modern era psychedelic trip. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Of course  this isn't to everyone's taste. It's very full on. The noise can be quite abhorrent out of context. Skip to 8:45 and it's screaming at you. That's the other problem  at nearly ten minutes  it's not the kind of song you can easily listen to every day - It's a victim of it's own epicness. Few radio stations would play it and you couldn't mix with it in a club. It's a standout  standalone song that has its place in music history  just not in the mainstream.PS.
