  You wrongfully assume people aren't dating as often. I work in an open kitchen and believe me  we get to see a lot of people on dates. Valentines day is always fully booked.There's a few key differences between dating now and what UK dating was like in the 90's. (I was a teenager in the 90's)  Communication had to be more organised. Phone calls had to be made via a landline or a phone box. None of this SMS business where you could leave a message to be read later. There would be times when youd literally have to sit next to your phone and wait.
