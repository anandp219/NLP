This allows for huge overheads: A piece of dough costs 5p  passata and mozzarella costs 10p  we sell a margarita for 8.99. We deal with a lot of fresh food  so theres a justified amount of wastage  were allowed to take home what we want. Mistakes can be eaten away from the public eye.The thing is We all get free food. You may think this is a good thing and to a degree it is  but its a double edged sword. The problem is  we have to eat the same food day in day out. This makes it incredibly boring.
