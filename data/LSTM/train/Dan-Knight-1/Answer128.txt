Working in an open kitchen subjects you to the restaurant music. Theres no freedom of choice. Its repetitive  distracting and mind-numbing. The only chance of a respite is on an open when I insist on earphones for some personal music time. Everyone knows when you make a mistake. You burn something  it happens. Unfortunately  in an open kitchen the room fills with smoke  theres no escaping it  the extractor fan can only do so much. Customers dont like this very much  especially when theyre hungry.
