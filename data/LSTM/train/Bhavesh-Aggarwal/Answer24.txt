  TL;DR: Maybe  but it's a bad idea.Circuit training is a great tool for conditioning  stamina  and even strength. It is  however  ONE tool out of an entire tool box. You don't want to do nothing but circuits. Second  if you're doing these workouts  even spread out over 5 days  you're training your whole body 5 times a week. That's a recipe for disaster. You don't want to train the same body part again within 48 hours  unless you're going very  very low with the total number of reps.Third  if you do that much on one day  your form will inevitably break down  and if you're doing the exercises wrong  your joints will pay the price.If you want to do this workout  do it on three non-consecutive days.
