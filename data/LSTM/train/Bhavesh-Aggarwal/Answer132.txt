Much tougher  much more rewarding. Ultimate mastery of the kip-up consists in doing it with straight legs  your feet already resting by your ears  a narrow stance upon landing  no backpedaling and your arms crossed in front of your chest. It will take lots of practice and hard work to get there someday  but if you become good at doing the standard version  you should get to the ultimate kip-up with smart and hard work. Can you do it on a decline with your head lower than your feet someday?Good luck!
