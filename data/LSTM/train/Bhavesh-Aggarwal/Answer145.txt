The difference will manifest itself more in the max velocity phase (30-50m) and then speed maintenance (50-100m). Your acceleration should be the same  or have improved very slightly. There's also a small chance that it might have become a little bit worse  particularly the first 10m.The 30-50m segment should take you 2.08s  (9.61m/s) and your 50-100m segment will be around 5.46 seconds.There are many assumptions in this answer  based on experience  measurements  and formulae that coaches employ.
