  For strong ankles  you need to focuse on a couple aspects.Mobility/FlexibilityStretch your calves and shin muscles between training sessions  and do dynamic stretches for the calves before your sprint workout. The dynamic stretches not only increase your range of motion instantly (although impermanently)  they also improve their reflexive response  which you're looking for when sprinting.Also  foam roll your calves and the soles of your feet. You can use a tennis ball for both.Dorsiflexion/PlantarflexionMany coaches confuse their sprinters by cueing them to 'dorsiflex the foot'  which means decrease the angle between the foot and the shin.
