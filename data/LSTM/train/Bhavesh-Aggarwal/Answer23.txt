Maybe  you need to eat more to grow. Maybe  you've just adapted so well to your training that your body sees no use in growing your pecs. From what you write in the description  it seems the the third option is the case. You did a workout for some time. You got all the gains you could from it.If you want to intensify your training  and make improvements  you need to shake things up. Add to the challenge  and watch your body adapt. I've written an answer on this subject before  and all of the ideas in it apply to your situation.
