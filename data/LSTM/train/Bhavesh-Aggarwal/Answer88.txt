  If you have nothing but the floor at your disposal (no bars at all)  by the far one of the best exercises is the elbow press. Zero equipment required  and lets you get a hell of a lats workout in. It's not as functional as a pull-up  though. Elbow PressesLie on the floor face up. Keeping nothing but your heels in contact with the ground  push through your elbows in an attempt to lift the body off the ground. Do not extend your spine (just keep it rigid)  all movement must come from you pushing into the floor.
