It might not fit your definition of REALLY working the lats  but it can be a good assistance exercise. You don't necessarily need bars to do them. They can be done off of two chairs placed together or other high furniture. PlanchesA planche is a fiendishly tough isometric hold  and while it's not a lat dominant exercise  it's another great zero equipment kind of thing. You need a floor  and yourself. Start by doing them tucked  i.e. you knees curled under the belly  and straighten out over time.
