If you can't get it right yet  go back to an easier move  and work up from there. Be patient  and you will be continuing to get strong for many years to come.Do challenge yourselfThe other end of the spectrum is also often seen. For somebody who wants to become stronger  going from 50 push-ups to 60 isn't all that great an improvement. Going from a single one-armed push-up to 11 one-armed push-ups  on the other hand  signifies a great increase in strength! On that note  when you're 'maxing out' with an exercise  i.e.  seeing how many repetitions you can do in one go  stop the set when your technique deteriorates.
