  Nope. Dips are a great overall pushing exercise (if performed correctly)  where your chest  triceps  and front deltoids get to do most of the work  in that order of importance. Triceps can also become the prime movers if you maintain a vertical torso.However  they can't match a military press in terms of pure shoulder engagement. Not a chance. The military press engages primarily the front deltoid  the lateral head as a synergist  and even the rear deltoid at the very end of the motion (near lockout).
