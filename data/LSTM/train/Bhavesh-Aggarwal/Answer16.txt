You will find that you can do typically around 20-30% more chin ups than pull ups. NegativesSometimes  even though you can do a good number of horizontal pulls  you may fail to do a single chin up/pull up. Negatives  or eccentrics can help you get the necessary stimulation to finally bust out your first rep(s). Using your legs  a chair or a relatively low bar  get up into the top position of a pull up  and lower yourself as slowly as you can. Go back to the top position and repeat. You will soon gain the strength necessary to do pull ups and chin ups.Half RepsMany coaches dislike half reps  saying they build 'only half the strength'  or that they don't translate well into the full rep.
