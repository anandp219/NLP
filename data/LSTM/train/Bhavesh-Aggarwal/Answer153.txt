They can't burn glucose  only convert it to lactic acid  and tire out within around 45 seconds.There are two mechanisms that cause a shift in a muscle from slow-twitch to fast-twitch  and from fast-twitch to 'very fast-twitch'. The one we've known for a long time is almost stupidly simple. If you demand high-intensity  highspeed contactions  the type IIx and type IIa muscle fibers will grow in size  and therefore proportionally make up more of the muscle cross-section.What wasn't well-researched until recently  and still isn't well-known  is that muscle fibers can actually change their protein synthesis such that they make the kind of myofibrills that can contract faster  effectively making a type I fiber convert to a type IIa.
