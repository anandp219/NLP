It's important to keep the elbows tucked in and close to your body  don't flare them out  but don't push them into your torso either. An angle of 30-45 between the flanks and the elbows works best.Should you be having a weak tendon  I suggest regressing to knee push-ups for higher reps  and doing ONLY the negative phase of proper push-ups. Once you're comfortable with those  say within a month's time  move to full push-ups again and see how you fare. If the problem persists  get a doc and have them check it out properly.
