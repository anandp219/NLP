Apart from the free weights  I am a fan of resistance bands (with enough places to anchor them)  weighted vests  and medicine balls. I would also like a TRX  wall bars  foam rollers  a Bosu and a gymnastics ball  boxes for plyometrics and elevated push-ups  and of course the space to do all my awesome calisthenics exercises  which can double as a stretching area.Speaking of calisthenics  an overhead bar with lots of space above it is a must. I don't mean one of those ergonomically shaped bars. I mean a standard overhead pull-up bar.
