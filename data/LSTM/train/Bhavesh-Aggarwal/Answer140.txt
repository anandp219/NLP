Even though your overall strength surely increased  it is possible that you lost relative strength (i.e. strength output in relationship to your bodyweight). This can negatively affect your start and your acceleration phase  which can make it harder for you to reach your top speed without expending too much effort and energy. However  the above mentioned factors should more than balance this out. Here's your data:100m time: 12.6 secondsAverage speed: 7.93m/sA reasonable estimate of your max speed would be around 9.2m/s.
