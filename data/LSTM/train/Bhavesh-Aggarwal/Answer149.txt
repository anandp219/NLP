  TL;DR: Yes  and there are two mechanisms that can make it happen.First  let's get clear on some terminology:Muscle: That's the big contractile organ  like the biceps brachii or the latisimuss dorsi. Muscle fiber: A cell withing a muscle. Contains many nuclei  and all the contractile elements  which are the basis for a muscles working.Motor unit: A group of muscles cells and the speficic neuron (nerve cell) controlling their contraction. In all muscles  a single fiber is always controlled by only one neuron  but a single neuron can control hundreds or even thousands of muscle fibers.
