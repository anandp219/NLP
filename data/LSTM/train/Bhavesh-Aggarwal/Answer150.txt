The muscle fibers within a motor unit are all the same type. (more on that later)Myofibrill: This is a 'little fiber' within a muscle fiber. A chain of contractile elements  made up of the cellular organelles doing the work. A single muscle fiber contains many of these myofibrills.Traditionally  we distinguish three muscle fiber types  although histochemical staining has shown that we have around 7  with varying properties. They all fall along a continuum  however.Type I fibers are the most thankful of all.
