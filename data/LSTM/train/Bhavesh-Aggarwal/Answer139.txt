  This is tricky to answer JUST in the context of height. Obviously  if there was a growth of 3 inches  you're not fully mature yet  and so not just your height  but many other variables must have changed too. Your physical strength will have increased  assuming normal development. So will the conduction speed of your nervous system  your coordination  as well the 'springiness' of your muscles. Naturally  more leg length helps increase stride length. This all bodes well for you.The one possible caveat I see is in the start and the acceleration.
