I like it when there are serious athletes training next to casual gym goers  a healthy mix of all sorts of people. It's especially important that the gym doesn't scare off women (or other gender minorities)  and keep them from working out when they want to. The personal traininers around should be competent and compassionate  not a bunch of steroid-filled  agenda-driven duds. All the other folks working should be friendly and helpful too  within reason. I also like it when the gym sells high-quality supplements at a reasonable price  but that is really me being picky.
