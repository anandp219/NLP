  The easy answer is: Because they need them. Arm action in sprinting is often described as 'hammering nails in a wall behind you'. The faster your arms are moving  the faster your legs will go. While downswings are somewhat conscious  upswings happen automatically because of the collective stretch reflexes of your shoulders  your chest and your arms. Think of doing hundreds of high speed reps in that fashion  and you can see how your upper body would get a good bit of training.However  sprinters do train their upper bodies  within reason.
