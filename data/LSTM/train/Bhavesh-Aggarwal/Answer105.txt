Progress with weights  or work towards making them one-armed.Dips Dips work the chest  shoulders  and triceps  much like the push-up. They can be considered a harder variation of the same  and therefore lead to more arm size. Do these very cleanly  however. Once your technique breaks down  the set is over. Anything else is an open invitation to shoulder problems.Planche Push-upsPlance push-ups are really tough. They're way harder than dips  because of the leverage. They hit the same muscles as dips.
