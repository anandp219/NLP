In other words  even if I am only 90% the height of my peers  I am still 100% human. And the question isn't whether you are a short or a beardless human being. It's whether you're a good human being. Be the best version of yourself that you can be. Lots of wonderful things will happen for you  I promise.Learn to love yourself and work with what you have. It's the only path to relative sanity in this crazy world.Thanks for the A2A  Anon.
