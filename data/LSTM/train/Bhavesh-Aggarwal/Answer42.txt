The flipside is that some White authors (and movie script writers) avoid Black characters as much as possible  allowing at most one thrown in there for diversity  without any true meaning to the story or depth. I'll take a well-attempted but somewhat flawed Black character over a complete omission any time. It's important for authors to research the history  culture  values  and views of the people they're writing about  but at the same time also allow for individuality and diversity within communities.
