It's unlikely to be a lack of blood circulation or something along those lines.That said  let's make one thing clear. It's not the beard. It's the wearer. Beards only work because they advertise manliness in a culturally defined way  and possibly your confident attitude. But that's all they do.Your beard  or lack thereof  does not define you as a person  as a human  or even as a man. You can either allow not having a beard to take away your peace of mind  or you can be mature about it  and understand that you're just different that way.
