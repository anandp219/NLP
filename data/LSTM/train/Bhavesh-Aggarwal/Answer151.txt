They can work at a low intensity for hours. Postural muscles are usually primarily type I fibers. Marathon professionals have muscles consisting of mostly this type. They burn sugar or fat  work completely aerobically  but don't grow much and can't exert a lot of force  nor contract very fast. Type IIa fibers are similar to type I fibers in that they don't fatigue very quickly. Similarly  they can burn both fat and glucose  and very importantly  depending on the demand being placed on them  they can release energy fast through the lactacid system  or help the body remove lactic acid.
