There's a reason friends are often perfect for sharing your fears or worries or insecuritiesthey are sufficiently close to you without being so close as to take everything extremely personally. People share stuff for different reasons. Some just want someone to confide in who can process the information relatively calmly  not necessarily a problem solver. If you get emotional or teary eyed or livid at the shortest provocation  your kid will avoid telling you unpleasant stuff  as telling it increases the problems in his life rather than easing them.The 20s are a difficult time for all of this.
