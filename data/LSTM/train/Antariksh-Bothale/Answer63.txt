  When people write their SOP (Statement of Purpose) while applying to graduate school or jobs  they write sentences like:"After completing my project in #FancyTopicName working with Prof. #BigShot  I decided to do an internship at #PrestigiousMNC so that I could apply my theoretical knowledge to real world problems and gain experience of the corporate environment"While writing SoPs  people talk as if their life path was perfectly charted out in advance  complete with Gantt Charts and Key Deliverables.
