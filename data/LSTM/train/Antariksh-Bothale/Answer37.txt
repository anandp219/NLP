Unlike  say  scout-cookies.Deep down  I imagine that most of us have (not sure whether innate or conditioned) appreciation for raw hard work. Often  hard work and perseverance are considered as the ultimate arbiters  and running is the kind of activity that demonstrates pure  raw  determination and hard-work  untampered by anything else that'd tilt the playing ground. Rather  in continuation of the previous point  it abstracts out any product / service and replaces it with just hard work and perseverance.
