People have to make the mental transition from needing their parents to potentially being needed by them. While school-going kids are taught to see parents as infallible authority figures  as captors who need to be defied  young adults have to slowly learn to see parents as more human  with their own hopes and aspirations  fears and insecurities. Between these two extremes is the territory most late teens and early 20s find themselves in  wherein they feel the need to assert their independence and gain footing in the world without being tethered to their parents.I don't intend to tell you that your kid is perfectly capable of taking all life decisions wisely.
