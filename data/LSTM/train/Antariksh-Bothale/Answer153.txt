  So far  it looks unlikely that any language will replace English as the lingua franca in the foreseeable future. Imperialism is largely a thing of the past and we don't have large-scale wars anymore  and nothing is actively stemming the growth of English  and  in general  I don't see how any other language will rise to that position given the inertia that English has.English became dominant at a crucial time: the spread of globalism and the rise of digital technology and internet have more or less cemented this dominance.
