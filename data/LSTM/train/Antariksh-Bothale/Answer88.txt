If  for instance  you made homophobic remarks while watching a movie or flipping through news channels reporting about 377  you can bask in the assurance that your gay son will never come out to you. Now  this is obviously not easy. After all  your values are not merely a fashion statement. You hold them because you  to a large extent  sincerely believe in them and subscribe to them. But every generation rebels. 30 years ago  people might have prided themselves for having a 'love marriage'. Many youngsters today take that to be the bare minimum.These differing versions of morality across generations aren't new  but it is possible that the chasm has widened due to the much more increased exposure that our generation gets.
