As a side note  I find the societal prejudice against crying rather laughable  since I find it to be of immense therapeutic value.Of course it is true that most people who ask others to 'man up' or to 'be a man' aren't necessarily misogynists themselves. But this name-calling achieves absolutely nothing anyway. You could pluck petals and count 'Misogynist! Not a misogynist! '  if you want  and we would get no further as a society unless we figure out exactly why such statements are problematic and correct the problem.As Gayle has suggested in her answer  whether we like it or not  misogynist or not  well-intentioned or not  this phrase (and specifically  its common usage):perpetuates a lot of (hetero-normative) gender stereotypestakes some supposed ideals (such as excessive stoicism) and sets them up as specifically associated with menassociates the negative quality of the lack of said dubious ideals with the female genderA certain amount of stoicism in the face of adverse circumstances is a positive quality  but encouraging (or rather peer-pressuring / bullying) people to bottle their emotions up forever because displaying them is unmanly is hardly the ideal we want to set up as a society anyway  as Eivind has pointed out in a long comment debate below one of the answers.Moreover  I find this phrase pretty indefensible even if we were to ignore the 'display of emotion' aspect and focused entirely on stuff like bravery or altruism.
