Because of the factor of 10  these units aren't conveniently divisible into thirds or fourths  which is again not conducive to everyday use. Think of recipes  for example. The cup  tea-spoon  table-spoon  fl. oz. system provides an easy  small-whole-number system for converting quantities. It is true that the non-standardization of what a cup or spoon is leads to inexactness  but in most cases  you can still scale recipes by using relative units. You ought to choose units based on what you are measuring.
