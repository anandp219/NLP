wtf is naagshakti why can't they just say Slytherin". This is a chicken and egg problem. There aren't too many good Hindi fonts  nor is there quality content in Hindi (whether in the terms of blogs or news websites or whatever) proportional to the number of people who speak it.Disney movies and shows usually do get dubbed into Hindi (and even Tamil  Telugu etc.) for Indian Television  so I guess they do bother to put in the effort when they think it'll be worth it.
