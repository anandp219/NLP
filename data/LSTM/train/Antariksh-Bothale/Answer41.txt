Whether this is out of courtesy for the listener or out of the annoyance of having to listen to your language being butchered by a non-native speaker  or a mix of both  I don't know. Personally  as a language learning enthusiast  I find it very very annoying if I make an attempt to speak in the local language and I get replied to in English  but I usually give people the benefit of doubt and assume that they either did it out of courtesy or just wanted to practise English.Finally  when you are in the queue at a fast-food place or even in a busy supermarket  people might just not have the time or patience to entertain your attempts at trying to communicate in the local language if you are not making a lot of sense.
