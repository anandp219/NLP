This helps me in two ways: It helps me end my monologue on a confident note  and it gives an easy anchor point that the interviewer can use to steer further discussionI think the ideal sweet spot is when your answer shows preparation (that you have thought about what you want to say)  but doesn't look entirely rehearsed. In short  prepare a list of things you want to talk about  but dont memorize the answer word by word. Answers that sound rehearsed are a turn off  especially if you are applying for a job that relies on communication.
