Likewise  being wrong does not preclude someone from getting sympathy.Prison sentences have to end up serving the dual role of keeping dangerous elements away from the society  and providing a disincentive for people by punishing them for breaking the law. Typically  these two often get treated differently by people. For instance  everyone seemed to sympathize with Ravindra Patil (the prime witness) when he said that he was put in prison with hard-core criminals for repeatedly failing to appear in court.
