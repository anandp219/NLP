Switching shaving cream for toothpaste  although very flimsy  is kosher. Switching hot water for cold water  which then proceeds to scald the user  is not.Finally  a much milder variation of the 'crying wolf' prank  which I'd illustrate using a personal story.When I was a kid  our school once declared the next day as a holiday for some reason. It wasn't a regular scheduled holiday  so my parents were not aware of it. I went back home  secretly happy about getting a day off  and decided to make a prank out of it.
