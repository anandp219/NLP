  Many factors make some languages more desirable to be learnt by people. On the global stage  English has emerged as the de-facto language that would make you most likely to be understood around the world. Some of the factors that contribute to this are:English is spoken in several countries around the world  so even passing competence in English is more likely to help you be understood around the world  whereas even expertise in Turkish is largely useless outside of Turkey. For a lot of people  the pragmatics of being able to communicate to a larger group of people far outweigh whatever motivations they may have for learning niche languages.English is massively culturally exported.
