  Last month  I got one of the nicest compliments I could have gotten as a human being.A guy pinged me one day and  after a small preamble  came out to me. He then said that he had told only a couple of friends so far and that I was probably the 4th or 5th person to know. Now  a bunch of people have come out to me prior to this  and it's not a big deal. But in this case  I was a bit surprised because I didn't know him. He is a junior from my university  but we have probably just met on a couple of occasions.I told him I was totally fine with it  and that he could trust me  but that I was curious why he had chosen to tell me despite not knowing me well.
