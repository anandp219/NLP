With larger movement of people across the country  especially to IT hubs such as Bangalore  Hyderabad  and to some extent Chennai  Hindi is now establishing itself as a fairly staple language of these parts too. Note that this does not mean that Hindi is the only language there or that people do not speak local languages or English: there are tonnes of people in South India who do not speak Hindi. But a (only) Hindi speaker will be better off on the streets of Bangalore than a (only) Malayalam speaker on the streets of Chandigarh.
