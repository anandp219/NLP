  To better help you out  the mentorship team at IIT Bombay (known as the Institute Student Mentorship Program or ISMP) has come up with a compilation of relevant information for all the UG programs at IITB. This website has a lot of material  and the aim has been to provide students with detailed information about the curriculum and general job portfolios of every department. We try to keep it updated every year with the help of students and alumni. Hopefully  it will help you make a more informed choice.
