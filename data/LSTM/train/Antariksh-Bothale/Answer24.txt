For instance  in India  you may stereotype Bengalis as fond of sweets  or Tamilians as fond of curd rice. In absence of any other relevant evidence  this is a fairly harmless stereotype. However  if Bengalis are being systematically and unfairly persecuted by other communities because of their fondness for sweets  or if someone who doesnt like curd rice is systematically denying Tamilians equal opportunities just because they are from the South  it is easy to see how invoking such stereotypes would be below the belt.The second thing of note is that merely the fact that a stereotype is statistically correct doesn't make it okay to peddle it.
