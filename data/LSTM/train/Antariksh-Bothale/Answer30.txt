But when someone does point out why this is problematic  I think they deserve to be heard instead of being typecast as pseudo-whatever. IIT Bombay has now officially banned Euphoria. This is a bit like suspending a police officer for taking a 200-rupee bribe  or failing a student for cheating when everyone knows that most others cheated too. Its technically correct  but it doesnt necessarily improve anything in itself unless the system is cleansed too  because the police officer is mostly just a symptom of the bigger problem.
