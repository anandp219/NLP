Many languages would have been considered to be so-called world languages at various points of time in history  but the first truly global language was and is English. I mean  no language even comes close. The only potential language that people keep touting is Mandarin  but I don't think it stands a chance either. Even if you were to discount for the extreme tall barrier that their writing system is  the fact is that none of the candidate languages have the kind of global traction that is needed for a language to become the lingua franca.
