  A resume of some sort is usually always required when applying for any position (even those procured via personal contacts  which involve Dad calling his friend who works at a good company and requesting them to place you).You might not have a lot of stuff to write about in your second year resume  but that applies to most people who have just finished freshmen year. Don't worry about it. I just went through my freshie year resume for reference. Consider including the following stuff:Your rank in standardized exams: JEE  BITSAT etc.
