[Later edit: I completely agree that celebrities (or anyone with a larger reach) should hold themselves to higher standards than others. But  these standards will come into place only when people realize and accept that there IS indeed a problem if you say in front of 10000 people that women are for beauty and men for intelligence. What annoys me isn't that Palash Sen said those things  but the fact that he so steadfastly refuses to acknowledge that they could indeed be problematic. It is clear that it's not a 'communication gap'  since his clarifications are as incriminating as the initial claims.
