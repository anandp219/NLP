I let my dad in on the prank  telling him about the holiday  but asking him not to tell my mom. I'm a bit hazy on the details but my 'plan' was that I'd wake up a bit late the next day  and delay everything so as to get late for the school bus. Then  when the whole household would freak out and my mom'd probably ask my Dad to drive me to the school  I'd shout Surprise! and reveal the truth. Everything happened as per the plan  except when I yelled surprise  my mom just said quietly"You could have pranked your Dad instead.
