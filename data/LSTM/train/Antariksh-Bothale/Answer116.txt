  I hope that  by graduate studies  you mean something akin to an MS and not a PhD. You shouldn't join a PhD program abroad if it is not paying you any salary at all and requires you to take loans.While it's not possible to suggest what you should do without a more detailed understanding of your family's financial situation  as a general rule  I won't particularly recommend selling off family assets if you can avoid it.INR 30 Lakh is not an insanely large loan amount if you are going to enter an industry that is well-paying (which seems to be the case).
