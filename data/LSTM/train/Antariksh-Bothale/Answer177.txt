Most of us never realize the inimical effect of all these tiny but constant and ubiquitous signals that we as a society send to ourselves.I know all this seems like petty nitpicking  but I hope that we all agree that  as a society  we should be moving away from such normativity and especially from deriving modern-day ideals from the middle-ages.We cannot stem all of it  but the least we can do is to not actively condone it.
