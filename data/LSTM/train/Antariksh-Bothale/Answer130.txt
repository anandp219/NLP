Obviously  branch does matter. All men may be created equal  but all branches certainly are not  which makes it all the more important that you have a realistic idea about your branch  instead of swallowing recycled stereotypical trash hook  line  and sinker.Department stereotypes are self-fulfilling propheciespeople tell you there are no future prospects in X branch  and you spend your IIT life resigned to this fatality  while wiser people go ahead  pursue those prospects  and get them.Eschew Department Stereotypes.Look for full disclosureAs freshies  you would find yourself at the receiving end of advice  suggestions  opinions  recommendations and what not from a wide variety of people (including  rather ironically  from me  through this post).
