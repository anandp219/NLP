If you try to be too nosy or try to micro-manage their lives  they will initiate micro-rebellions. For instance  although they could tell you that they are going to Marine Drive with their friends  they'd choose NOT to  because that gives them a sense of self-control  of autonomy  and of not being constantly monitored or policed.Ironically  the more you try to be a helicopter parent of someone who is essentially an adult  the more likely you are to become distant from them. Someone I know had such helicopter parents.
