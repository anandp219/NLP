The fact is that not all people comfortably identify with the binary buckets that we like to put ourselves in for ease of classification. And I imagine it would be greatly relieving for such people if they are given greater freedom to choose.Plus  it causes no difference whatsoever to the lives of most of us who are lucky enough to have identities that more or less align with social norms. And it makes a positive difference to the lives of the relatively few who to whom it does matter. A friend of mine  for instance  changed their pronoun setting on FB to they from the original he.
