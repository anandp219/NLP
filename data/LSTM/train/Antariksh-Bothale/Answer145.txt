Hollywood in particular and the American entertainment industry in general have given the world countless movies  TV programming  songs and the like that play over the radio or can be seen on TV no matter what country you are in. On the other hand  while some people might like Turkish music and watch Turkish movies outside of Turkey  Turkish culture has a significantly smaller active impact on the world.Because of the above factors  the knowledge of English often increases people's mobility  employability (and often  provides access to a much greater pool of information  or resources)  much more compared to knowledge of relatively niche languages.
