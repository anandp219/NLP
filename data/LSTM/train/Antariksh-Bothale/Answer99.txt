  A lot of people love traveling on freeways since it helps reduce travel time  lets you drive faster than you can in cities  and doesn't have a red light every couple of hundred feet. But how many people care about the US freeway system enough to memorize which freeway passes through which city (even in parts of the country they have never visited or care about) or to study the intricacies of freeway intersection design despite no other specific interest in Civil Engineering? (Source: Wikipedia)The first category of people I have described have largely a functional interest in those respective topics  such as liking cars because they help you move.
