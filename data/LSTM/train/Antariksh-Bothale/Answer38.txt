I will end with a small quote from Three Men on a Bummel by Jerome K Jerome Folks with nothing else to do  nursemaids chiefly and errand boys with now and then a perambulating costermonger added  would gatheron the common of a fine morning to watch them pass  and cheer themost deserving. It was not a showy spectacle. They did not runwell  they did not even run fast; but they were earnest  and theydid their best. The exhibition appealed less to one's sense of artthan to one's natural admiration for conscientious effort.I think it's this natural admiration for conscientious effort  unfettered by anything else  that appeals to us all the most about marathon events.
