  I dislike most selfies  but not for deep psychological reasons. My reason is very personal and very  err  selfishMost selfies aren't good. By good  I mean  good-looking photographs that have value for people other than those photographed (or their very close friends). And because of social media  we have to end up seeing them anyway. However  that should of course not stop people from taking them. Which is why I speak just for myself.In the last few years  mobile cameras were getting better  so you came across plenty of decent pictures on your stream.
