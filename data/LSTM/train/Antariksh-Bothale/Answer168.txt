As far as possible  we should try not to police people's liking / preferences.But when individual desires get fossilized and institutionalized  an innocuous preference turns into a much more malevolent societal prejudice.Take  for instance  the issue of sex selection in India. At an individual level  it's perfectly fine to want to have a boy and not a girl. A lot of countries allow couples to 'choose' the sex of their child and the sex ratio of these countries has remained healthy despite this freedom.
