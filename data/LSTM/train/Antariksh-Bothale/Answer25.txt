It doesn't take a genius to observe that there are fewer women than men in STEM (science  technology  engineering  and mathematics) fields  while the reverse may hold for  say  the liberal arts. However  using this as proof that 'men are for brains' while women are for beauty is not correct. Additionally  it is important to realize that a possible reason for not too many women being in STEM fields is the fact that their participation receives significantly more social resistance than that received by men (if any).
