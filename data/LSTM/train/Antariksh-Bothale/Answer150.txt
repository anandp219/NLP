  The short answer is that they do not. In specific  you should not think of the GRE as the JEE (or GATE) of the United States. Your JEE score is the sole decider of whether or not you get into IIT. On the other hand  the GRE is one of the many variables that are in consideration when deciding the fate of an application. The General GRE is also subject agnostic. It is NOT designed or intended to judge your competence in your major (there are Subject GREs for major-specific testing which are fairly technical and directly relevant).
