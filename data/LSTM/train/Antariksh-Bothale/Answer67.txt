Use this to tell yourself that there's a lot you can do  but obviously do not limit yourself to what has already been done.The problem with people with stereo-typically 'good' profiles is that life often does not take their decisions for them through rejection. It's easy to decide when you have just 1-2 viable options; it's tougher when you have 10 of them. Try not to get overwhelmed by them  and instead try to derive a sense of security or comfort from them. As for absolute clarity about what you want to do  well... that may never come.
