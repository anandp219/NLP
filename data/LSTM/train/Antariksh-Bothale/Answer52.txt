  My roommates and I were discussing (in jest  in case that isn't clear) yesterday night that we should all root for Sundar Pichai for the MS CEO role  just so that we can maintain the IIT hegemony in the tech industry. Jokes apart  though  I think most people realize and acknowledge that hard work and stellar performance almost always trump academic pedigree. This is likely to be overwhelmingly true for the choice of a CEO  where you'd rather judge a person on the acumen they have shown and the results they have delivered for their company across the years  rather that what school they graduated from 25 years ago.
