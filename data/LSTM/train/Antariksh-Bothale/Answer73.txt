If you are measuring driving distance  the fact that a centimeter is one ten-thousandth of a kilometer is largely useless. So a mile is equally well suited for expressing such distances  since both are arbitrary units anyway.The moral of the story is that while the merits of using metric units in scientific computation are plenty  they are not necessarily the most natural units to use for everyday life. Of course  it is possible to use them  like Europe does  but the best strategy of course is to use whatever tool you find convenient for your purpose.
