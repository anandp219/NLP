Develop the judgment to figure out whose opinion to take on a particular matter. It is very rare that youd encounter a person who could give you valuable advice across a large and diverse array of fields. The guy who gives you excellent dating advice wont necessarily give you great foreign-internship fundae. And the friend who you trust your deepest secrets with might give you lousy advice about which elective to take.Also  look for full disclosure. Often  a lot of what people would tell you would be tainted with whats good for them instead of whats good for you.
