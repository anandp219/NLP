  One of the first things taught in an introductory linguistics course is that our knowledge of our native language is tacit knowledge. It is notoriously difficult to actually write down the patterns that you observe in a language. But ask any native speaker if a sentence is grammatical  and they would tell you their judgment instantly.When people formally study their native language  or see others studying it  they are often introduced to the correctness conditions [1] of their language  or to interesting phono-morpho-syntactic tid-bits.
