  As a general rule  if you are in a foreign country  it is usually never a problem if you try to speak the local language [and appear to be making a genuine attempt rather than trying to mock them]. The response you get may vary slightly with where you try this  but it is in general positive. In countries where English is taught but not really spoken all that much  the service staff would mostly be more than glad to talk to you in t the local language  and even humor your potentially wrong attempts at it.
