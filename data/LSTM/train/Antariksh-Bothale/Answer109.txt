But it wasn't until after I had taken JEE that I actually started exploring languages. Although linguistics itself isn't necessarily about learning languages  having some background in linguistics does make it easy to pick up new languages. In the largely creative atmosphere of IIT Bombay  I got the opportunity to pursue academic interests peripheral to my major. I studied French and earned the DELF B1 certification. I used audio courses to study elementary German  Arabic and Spanish. I enrolled in a Japanese course and passed the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) level N4  after which I promptly took up Mandarin  which I studied for a while.
