Just like you  he recognized the importance of me learning English. Being the only English speaker in the house  he'd often talk to me in English  and encourage me to reply in English  helping me figure out the best way to frame reply. He was my go-to English resource. I also went to a school where the medium of instruction was English. However  that doesn't ensure anything in itself.Kids don't usually like to learn if they know they are being 'made' to learn stuff. He'd employ interesting techniques to ensure that I absorbed things without being consciously aware of them.
