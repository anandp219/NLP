(Couldn't find the original source for either image. Both have been uploaded several times on various websites).So now people choose to chronicle major events of their life (weddings  graduation etc.) with selfies. These were the kind of events for which I'd earlier see extremely high quality shots taken in good lighting conditions. Photographs that were a pleasure to look at even if you didn't directly care about the event. Now  we get grainy  close-range shots with 5-6 seemingly dismembered and 2-3 partially covered heads with everything looking out of proportion.
