One hopes that in a large sample of parents  there will be many who'd want to have a girl  and many who'd want to have a boy  and the numbers would even out. But in a country like India  the desire to have a male child has institutionalized itself to the extent that it is no longer possible to expect things to remain in a natural equilibrium. In a similar fashion  virginity has historically and traditionally been associated with arbitrary notions of purity. We know that women have been at the receiving end of long-term institutionalized prejudice  and glorification of virginity is just one face of this many-headed monster.
