The most recent example I found is a commercial launched by Airtel (idea flicked from a similar Carlsberg commercial). The Airtel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...) one looks excessively fake and seems to have been terribly executed  but the idea remains the same"Call your friend late at night and tell them that your life is in danger  and that they need to come and save you." I find these to be in extremely bad taste  and just watching the video was so infuriating  that I am sure if any of my friends pulled such an asshole-y trick on me  it'd be the last time I ever had anything to do with them.Stuff that causes fairly short-lived confusion / fear but doesn't otherwise cause any harm is usually kosher.
