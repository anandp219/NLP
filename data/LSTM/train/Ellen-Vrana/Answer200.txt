  I know for a FACT that one of my cats hid the following information from his brother;If you jump into the shower while Ellen is in it you will get wet and we hate wet - so don't do it And THEY BOTH had to learn the lesson the wet way.Is that evil? Or is it proof that while cat language that has 50 words (sounds) for I'm hungry but I don't like the 5 options you just gave me  try another  it lacks the grammatical sophistication to communicate warnings such as If you jump into the shower while Ellen is in it you will get wet and we don't like wet - so don't do it.I don't know.I know for a FACT that one of my cats routinely puts food on his brother's head.
