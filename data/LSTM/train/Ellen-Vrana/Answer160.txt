  This answer is more of an act than a line.For this you need 2 guys; a bar or drinking establishment  preferably crowded; and 2 women you'd like to "pick-up. "Guy 1 buys a drink (beer bottle) and goes over near the girls and asks casually "Would you mind holding this  I have to tie my shoe." She looks confused but does. He bends down. Guy 2 jumps into the scene shouting "It's a trap!" Grabs the drink (without spilling) and says "Sorry  but you were holding a thermal detonator!!"HAHAHAH!!! Makes me laugh even typing it out.IF you don't get arrested and IF they get the reference  they will love it.
