- This is very hard to achieve consistently throughout the entire book. Most authors break up perspectives by chapter rather than having them all in one scene. So while each chapter is a 3rd person intimate  the entire book has the effect of 3rd person omniscient.Examples of books that use Omniscient narration well- Cormac McCarthy's The Road - This narration briefly jumps into the head of the boy and the man. Because it doesn't jump very deep into either  it works and the reader is emotionally bonded to both of them (critical in a book where everything else is so alienating.)
