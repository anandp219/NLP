Just your self today  this week. That's it. Do this always  for as long as you write. Why? Here's why:1. Readers don't know what they care about until they read it. You have a LOT more latitude than you think. Ignore trends  if something is trending  you've missed it. Trends weren't always trends  at some point they were someone's original thought.Do you think people in 1965 were sitting around thinking "Gawsh  could do with a story about mass murder of a family in the heart of the Midwest." Hardly.
