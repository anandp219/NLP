Remind him that you haven't forgotten him  that you love him  that he's important to you. Tell him that when he accuses you of cheating  it hurts you and damages your relationship.If he can't engage with you on this level  if he still hides behind this "cheating" paranoia  then it might be time to move on. He deserves to feel noticed  but you deserve a partner who will sort through his emotions in a mature way.
