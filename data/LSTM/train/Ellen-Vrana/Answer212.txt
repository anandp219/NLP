  I've included two of my favorites:1. Etgar Keret's Asthma Attack from his Collection The Girl on the Fridge. Keret is a terrific  often surreal but deeply poignant Israeli short-story writer. I included this as a photo to show just how short it is. Could be a poster  a sticky-note. He doesn't tell you what happens  he intimates it. I love his writing. 2. The second one is by Lydia Davis a short story writer of tremendous creativity and originality whose collection Collected Stories of Lydia Davis won the Man Booker International Prize in 2013.This one makes me smile and imagine the occurrence  every time.
