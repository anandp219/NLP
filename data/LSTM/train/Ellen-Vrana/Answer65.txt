It might be that you just don't like content females often write about. I don't like crafts. Many females blog about crafts. I don't follow them. I don't follow the blogs about crafts written by men.It might be that there are just not females writing about the things you care about. I love movies. Every single person on Quora I follow who writes about movies is a male.
