These questions are to help you figure out why you like them.Finally  on the craft of Essay writing  I've found these helpful (I'll add more as I read more);William Zinsser's On Writing Well. I think is 30 yrs old and still kicking. C. S. Lakin's The Fiction Writer's Handy Guide to Grammar  Punctuation  and Word Usage it says "fiction" but it's universally useful.I wouldn't recommend instruction manuals. You are much too talented for form essay and you will most certainly be limited by it.
