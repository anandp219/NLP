This is a unique approach because the reader gets full access to the character's self-awareness or lack there of. We readers see first hand what is going on in the protagonist's mind. When self-awareness  or lack there of  is a component of the theme  1st person works well.Example: I felt sad. Susie looked at me  she looked confused. Jane shivered when she looked at me  she was probably angry. We know what the narrator feels  and what he notices the others do and what he thinks they feel.Considerations for using this narrative perspective:- Bonds the reader to the main character because there is no narrative distance between reader and character.
