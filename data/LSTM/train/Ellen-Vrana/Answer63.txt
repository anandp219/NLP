  We met our first year attending Stanford Graduate School of Business. We were introduced by my roommate at a party we had in our room. I vaguely remember meeting him  I think I was opening the fridge at the time. He says today he instantly thought I was cool but dressed poorly. My roommate knew him already and said he was an asshole  but the cool kind of asshole (whatever that means). He was a finance guy so was a bit full of himself. I didn't think much of him until I got to know him. We used to text jokes to each other during class to see if we could make the other person laugh out loud.
