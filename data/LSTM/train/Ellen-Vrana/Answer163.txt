Except  that isn't that. If you think this way at 28  you will spend your 30s reinforcing what you've decided at 28 rather than reevaluating your more mature self and its needs.At 31 you'll feel a nagging doubt but you shrug it off because it's a tickle and YOU have it figured out. You made a plan at 28. You take comfort in that.At 35 the tickle starts to be a scratch  and the doubt gets bigger but you still shrug it off because well  you've come so far  it's all about sunk costs. But you might start drinking.At 40 the scratch becomes a full-on rash and you are suffering  what you have is not what you want and you realize your life at 40 has been taken hostage by what your 28 year old self thought was the answer because you were afraid of not having an answer.
