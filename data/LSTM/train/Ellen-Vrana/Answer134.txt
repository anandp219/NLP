Just repeat the quotes at the socially acceptable time. That's what everyone does. If you don't know any make one up and say it came from Donnie Darko (2001) or Full Metal Jacket (1987). Two movies everyone thinks they should have seen and are usually embarrassed to admit they haven't. Have fun! I'm jealous. There are many movies I wish I could watch for the first time. I should mention that watching these movies won't give you a remote comprehensive understanding of film as an art form. But you didn't ask for that so  whatever.May the Schwartz be with you!!
