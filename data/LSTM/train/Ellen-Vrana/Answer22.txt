Yes  there is a lot of craft in all types of writing  but breaking free of that *could* make you a better writer.The accolades! The upvotes  likes  fans etc. To be a writer is to be seen  loved.These are all wonderful attributes that probably have lured more than one innocent diary-writer into being more than a diary-writer. Add that to the ease with which one can get "published" (you really just need an internet connection and a few thousand words) and sure  writing is ideal!The reason it's overrated is that people erroneously think these wonderful attributes become EXPONENTIAL when you do it as a career.
