Marriages - good marriages  ones that work - must exist in dark spaces too  not just the light.Marriage has no baseline.With a few exceptions  there is no standard of what is good  normal  acceptable  and what is not. No one can tell you what to do with it  about it  it is entirely your responsibility to manage your marriage. There is no right answer so don't seek one.Marriage is bigger than you. Bigger than both of you.If my answer sounds like marriage is this mythical thing that cuddles in bed with you and your spouse and at times steals sheets - that's because it is.
