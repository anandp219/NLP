I PROMISE you  he or she doesn't think you are any more crazy than anyone else. You are hiding it more than you think. Trust me on that  if I've learned one thing  it's that we're better at "not letting it show" than we think.Another solution is to let this monster out of the cage  for walks  occasionally  with people you trust. Do you have people around whom you can have your mental illness? You have to. You have to let someone in and let someone help you with this. The reason that your question affected me is that I immediately realized  I don't have anyone.
