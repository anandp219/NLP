  How do you make science content interesting and appealing to people with non-science background?Excellent question. First  your content is fine. You answered the question. Anyone who has ever asked "Why do soldiers . . . " will be pleased with your answer (I would implement Koyel Bandyopadhyay's suggested changes).But what you haven't done  is make it accessible to people who haven't asked this question. That's what you need to work on and what I'll address.If you want to be widely read - or indeed noticed - in the highly-competitive and saturated world of online content you have two options;a) write click-bait crap that gives people fuzzy happy thoughts about themselves and their world OR b) turn insightful  technical content into something more broadly appealing.Option A is as nourishing as white bread.
