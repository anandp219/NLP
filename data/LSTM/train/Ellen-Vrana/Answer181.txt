You should describe it.Example: He flashed his red gums at me. I.e. he sneered (I assume? )This was necessary because he's not always sneering. Tells me the guy is angry. Or is he smiling? Ah  to my next point.. . 3. Don't use long descriptions when simple ones will do. (I'm picking on your examples here  yes  forgive me.) He sneered is MUCH clearer than He flashed his red gums at me.I hear the former  I think 'yup  dude's upset. Probably at the narrator.' Got it. Ohhhh  wonder what happens next?The latter has me wondering 'Is he's smiling?
