The most simple way to structure is;(1) Beginning  (2) Middle + Climax  (3) Resolution.I tend to make it chronological first to get the plot right  then I play around with what happened when. I call it Memento-ing the story. I might start with the outcome  not the tragedy  then a flash-back to show how it got there.Examples of a plot include:(1) Unloved person is unloved and (2) then finds love  destroys it (3) lives alone. (1) Unloved person is unloved (2) then doesn't find love and (3) takes revenge(1) Unloved person is unloved (2) expects love  is disappointed (3) loves anyway.3.
