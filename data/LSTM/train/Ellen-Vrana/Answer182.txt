Sneering? Why are his gums red  does he not take care of them? Is he afraid of dentists? Why is he afraid of dentists?' Did he have a bad experience? Why? . . so on.I'm distracted from the main point; this dude is upset. Sure  you might proceed in the next lines to tell me all about his phobia of drills and shots and yes  Ellen  he IS afraid of dentists. And this might be really well-written and detailed and well-researched except I'm going to be sitting there thinking (possibly yelling):WHY DOES THIS MATTER?
