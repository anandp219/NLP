"Uncle Ledger would say  once you've ridden a horse  you should know what a horse is." from Pigs in Heaven Uncle Ledger is Native American and from the central plains of the U.S.  Kingsolver doesn't mention an accent  but the way he speaks of a culture that knows and understands horses - as many people including Native Americans living in the Plains do - you can more easily hear a voice that might belong to him.Be careful not to make characters cliche. A Native American who only talks about animals and spirits is a cliche (not to mention racist).
