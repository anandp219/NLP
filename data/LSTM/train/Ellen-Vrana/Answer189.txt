If you want to get his respect  develop a sense of morality and virtues that are at the level of Mother Teresa. He cares about goodness.If you want to make him laugh quote random lines from the following movies: Dave  Hot Shots  Spy Games  French Kiss  any Bond movie. He has a weird  esoteric sense of humor which really never ages.If you want to impress him save 10% on everything you buy  ever. He is quite thrifty.If you want to attract him be a strong  confident  powerful woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind or have others dislike her for what she believes.You also need empathy  vibrancy  a willingness to talk to cats like they are human  and a hatred of people who unilaterally "hate" bankers just because everyone else does.And most of all  if you want to make him feel how special he is let me know how you get along because I intend to spend my life doing that  and I'd love a short-cut.
