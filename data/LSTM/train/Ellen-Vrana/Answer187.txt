I never appreciated service until I moved to the UK  where most waiters would sooner spit on me than take my order. That  incidentally  is also part of the social contract; waiters must provide good service.Tipping waiters is what we do in America. The tipping culture exists to compel better service and cheaper meals. It allows (or should allow) the best waiters to get the most reward. (Whether it does or not is a much bigger issue than you tipping your waiter or not).If you respect America enough to visit  and to enjoy its many  many privileges  you have to respect this too.
