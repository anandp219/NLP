It's a steep drop but it's also a new beginning which is exciting. Take time to process the emotions but don't let them take over. Digest your failures  get the nourishment they can provide  and you will achieve great power. I don't carry failures around as such  but their residue is in everything I write  communicate  think and say. They are part of me. That's where the power comes from. I believe I can do most anything that I want and I have myself to blame if I don't.I wrote an answer telling people to fail because it is important part of growing and developing.
