  You don't like this non-credit world? Really?Oh  that must be because you are a current user. You're not thinking about it right. You're not thinking about it like Quora does. They are not interested in you. I mean they are  they want to keep you and keep your account active - if you have a good bio  ask good questions and write good answers. If you don't - it's fine if you lurk.But what they are REALLY interested in is the marginal non-Quora user who types into Google "What camera took the photo of Pluto and how does it work?"
