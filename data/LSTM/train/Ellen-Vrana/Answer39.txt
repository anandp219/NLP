Who are you to change that?You are the voice of intelligence and reason. You are a good person. You're someone who will win at life. I promise you  in life (and after the age of 35) being a good person is what matters. All that matters.How to start? How do you change your values and start to deliver on them?Start with Facebook. Since you're probably on there already. Make a plan to read 10 posts from friends  and to make yourself feel positive about them. When you feel the self-doubt creep  imagine them being happy.
