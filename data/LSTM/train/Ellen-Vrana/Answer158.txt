Chills run up or down spines  depending on where you live  and ideas aren't just clear  they are crystal clear. What is crystal? It's what you drink your whiskey in. With the ice that clinks.Things are notably pale  thick  greasy  cold  strong and dry which don't need to be. If it's a pillow we know it's soft. Ditto Coke and cold. Words like eat and ran and speak are passed over for gobbled and raced and exclaimed. People can't just hold they have to clasp  they can't cry they have to sob and they can't stop they have to come to a halt.
