Yes  we think so. Should we plan to visit each other regularly? Probably  makes sense. Should we just get married? Oooh  we don't know. We need to think. Maybe? But how do we know? We didn't know.I am 90% sure I was the one who said "Shouldn't we just get married?" Does that count as a proposal?Regardless  marriage was now in the air  it was out  it was between us. We thought about it. For a week or two. And in the meantime graduated GSB and planned our summer trip to hike in the National Parks in Southern Utah.And then we went out to a movie with friends.
