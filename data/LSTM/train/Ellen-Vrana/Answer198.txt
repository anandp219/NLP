3. Maintain empathy for your audience in your tone  words and examples. What does your audience react to? Try to minimize specific-speak that can be confusing or off-putting. Link to Wikipedia. Use metaphors or similes. Draw connections "the give of a bridge that allows for this movement is the same give that allows massive trucks to drive across or the force that can make us fly off a trampoline when someone else is bouncing on it" (I made up that science but you get my point).We all speak different technical languages  being aware of your own and how it sounds will help you speak to more people.4.
