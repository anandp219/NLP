Readers will resent you for that. You can also use different POVs to wrap a plot in tension or an emotional mood  rather than move it forward. Perhaps the characters aren't at the same time and place  one comes first to set the stage  and the second one continues with the main story. Amy Tan often does this  specifically The Kitchen God's Wife  starts 1st person POV of the daughter  reflecting on her mother today  then switches to her mother's 1st person POV reflecting on her past. While the POVs aren't synchronized by time they are by theme and emotions.
