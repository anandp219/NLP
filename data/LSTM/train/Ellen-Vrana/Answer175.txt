Ironing out the details. This is actually the bulk of your work  (I'm giving a HIGH level overview  but you should put a lot of pre-writing energy and time into these aspects).Characters - what are character motivations? Start with main character  depending on your theme  it might be to find love  to give love  to reject love  or love might not be the main theme. Do you need a secondary character? Who are they  what are their motivations? Write character backstory  remember; what you are really looking for as you explore your characters' history are the epochs  the catalysts  the notable events that have marked your characters' lives for better or worse in a way they'll never forget.- Outlining your Novel  K.M.
