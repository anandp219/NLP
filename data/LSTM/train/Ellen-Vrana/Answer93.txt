He also employs a lot of dialog  showing what the characters feel rather than telling. 1st person would have been much too immediate  too personal and frankly  too warm for the tone of this book.Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice  of course  does this well. Austen allows us to know the thoughts of Elizabeth  Mr. Bennett and a few others. Like McCarthy  Austen hangs back on rambling  penetrating emotional synopsis  however  and presents the characters mainly in dialog - it feels like we are more closely to Eliza than we really are yet we still understand thoughts of most of the characters.4.
