Even extroverts.That being said  above all - make sure you always do what you want for the right reason. Make sure that if you avoid small-talk and interactions  it's because you want to  not because you're rebelling in concept. Introverts  - myself included - have a habit of being overly self-protective because we feel if we don't  no one else will. But sometimes we can do it too much for our own good. Understand yourself - sounds like you're nearly there (bravo!) - then educate others. And find strength in other introverts  we're all going through the same thing.
