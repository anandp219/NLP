  (I'm going to assume you're not cheating and that there is no evidence of you cheating that he could point to. )Sometimes people get paranoid and create a "drama" so others will pay attention to them. They are deeply afraid of being left out  forgotten (consider this is why you often see it with the elderly). The paranoia alleviates feelings of loneliness and abandonment. Even though in the long run it has the affect of alienating the very people they seek to connect to. The paranoia he's feeling - the idea that you are "cheating" - draws you in and makes you act in a way that is caring about him.
