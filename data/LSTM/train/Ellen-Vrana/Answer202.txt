I don't know.I know for a FACT that they completely disobey house rules that the chairs are to be stared at and/or sat on while the scratching post is to be torn apart. Is that evil?Or are they in the employ of my husband who also hates these chairs and has planned to diabolically destroy them since I got them from my mom.I DO know. In this case my husband is behind it. I think he's scratching the chairs himself and blaming the cats.But are cats evil? No  they are so innocent!Or are they . . . No.
