If the answer is "no"  the next recommended accomplishment should be to build a habit of exercise and healthy eating  that will ensure that things you couldn't do by the time you were 40 you can do in your 50s or 60s and more. Further  I would recommend becoming deeply self-aware. What makes you tick  what ticks you off  how you relate  how you negotiate  what are your values  how strong is your willpower  what will not matter if it goes away tomorrow. Deep self-awareness enables the cutting out of meaning-free activities  which are easier to phase out over a year  and of course  you can tick them off your list as you go.
