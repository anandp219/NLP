  When Madonna married the British film director Guy Ritchie  she tried very hard to fit in  to be British and to adopt British mannerisms. She bought a house in London and an estate in Wiltshire; although she didn't drink  she often accompanied her husband to Punch Bowl  a pub he owned  from where pictures of her asleep on a pub bench sometimes surfaced; she also reportedly adopted an English sounding accent. The British press loved it all -- after all she is a superstar -- and gave her the nickname Madge.
