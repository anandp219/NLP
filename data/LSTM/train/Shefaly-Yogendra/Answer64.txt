It is all very good when we hear of Kalpana Chawla  Sanjay Gupta etc but mention Bobby Jindal and Rajat Gupta and watch the squirm! Is it universal? I don't know. I have only anecdata but that covers Scots  Welsh  Italians  French and Indian friends. An amusing observation I make is that all these groups are quite proud and feel they are culturally superior to the society and people they are having to share their space with. But with more and more people being globally mobile  growing up and living in many cultures and countries  there is growing comfort with identifying with more than one identity.
