  Tl; dr: Tell your story with all its richness and layers and depth  without getting caught up in announcing its length upfront. If the story is interesting and you are regaling to the right audience  the "timespan verbiage" does not matter. I can think of several gentlemen and ladies  whom I count as friends and mentors  and whose careers have exceeded 30 years. All of them are still working and being paid handsomely. None of them disavows their experience and the years  or uses "timespan verbiage".
