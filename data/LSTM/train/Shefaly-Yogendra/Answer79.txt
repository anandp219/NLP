He however was not pissed off or annoyed because the conversations  where he didn't keep up  gave him a lot of things to mull over later. That probably explains why despite many times when I did likely piss him off or annoy him  we are still friends. I  in turn  easily switch off from people  who are floating through this world without observing  engaging  asking questions or taking a stand. Those friends don't get a chance to ask me the question at all. So  yes  ask away  but be prepared to hear what the friend says without being pissed off with yourself for asking and him/ her for answering.
