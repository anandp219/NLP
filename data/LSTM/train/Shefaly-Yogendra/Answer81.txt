On Native American issues  Noel Rosario and Sam Morningstar are amazing while race in America  a sensitive subject is tackled smartly by Desmond Hardy  a man whose first answer made me tell him I saw him as a brother from another mother. On pop and film music complete with historicity  Aaron Ellis is da man. On literature in general and especially Hindi language  I recommend Kritika Gupta. She also writes impassioned and informed answers on social and environmental problems in India (some on garbage which are really worth reading.)
