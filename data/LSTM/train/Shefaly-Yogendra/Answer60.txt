  I once had occasion to bring a 70+ year old relative  who is still a practising criminal lawyer  into the tech/ online world. He used to carry case files -- all paper -- with him every day to and fro the courts. The weight bothered him and worried his wife. These cases are available online but he didn't know how to get to that. I started with helping him buy a laptop. He didn't know the hardware buttons or the keyboard  or what the ports did. We then progressed to using office software. And soon enough there was his turn to experience the web  complete with an education on viruses  malicious mails  pop up ads  ads that follow us around  ad blockers and such dubious delights.
