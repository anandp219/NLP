Your relative with some grounding in economic and history may find that training similarly useful although he/ she may be unable to avoid or ignore the deeper things that will gnaw at him/ her. That isn't a bad thing necessarily. Nearly all employers conduct induction training which gives new hires basic tools to become productive at their immediate jobs  and newer skills may be learnt on the job or through formal training  as one goes on. So the liberal arts degree or the absence of formal business credits may not be a huge challenge.
