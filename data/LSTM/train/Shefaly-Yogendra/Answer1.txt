  No.Because the OP wouldn't be allowed to use Quora. For the record  the question I have addressed is worded as follows: //Should only the people who have attained a certain level of English to post be allowed to use Quora?// This question can be written so much more elegantly but I am not going to suggest edits on this occasion. Quora allows users to suggest edits to questions & answers  and explain them as well. This can help those  whose knowledge of English may not be native-grade*  write better in the future.
