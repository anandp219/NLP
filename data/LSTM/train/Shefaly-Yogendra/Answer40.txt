An unscripted conversation may also work well when it is a prelude to a more scripted chat such as in private banking for UHNWIs (ultra high net worth individuals)  where high trust is needed. Trust cannot be scripted into relationships but it can definitely be broken by poor unscripted chatter. An unscripted conversation also could work well when it appears more unscripted than it is. All small talk in art galleries would fall under this categorisation. This is however a specialised area of work  which brings me to the next point.
