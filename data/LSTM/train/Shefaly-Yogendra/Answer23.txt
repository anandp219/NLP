Reading through the question details  I can infer reasonably you wish to study maths and I will assume that as an undergraduate course. If you are indeed applying to study maths at undergraduate level  then you likely already know that Cambridge maths tripos is one of the toughest things to get into and subsequently pass in its field. You are up against some stellar applicants  whose nationality is of no great importance to Cambridge maths department  which is more keen to ensure its reputation remains intact  some of which is ensured by picking only the best students that apply.
