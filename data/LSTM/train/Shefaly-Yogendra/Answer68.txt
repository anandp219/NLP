  The one thing that youthism around us does not enable us to do is accept that at 40  in most developed nations and well-off families  we aren't even half way through our lives. Accepting and understanding that would be the first thing I would recommend  since you ask. It redefines how we see time - a shift from the scarcity mindset to a plenty mindset. Related to that  in the next year  assess your fitness and ask yourself if this body will last you forty or fifty more years. Assess for stamina  balance  flexibility  strength and disease-free-ness as it were.
