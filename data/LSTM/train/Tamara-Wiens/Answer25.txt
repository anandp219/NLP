  The LGBTQ community is full of people  raised in cis het normative environments  where the only acceptable/possible way to be was the same as your parents/family/friends/church members/schoolmates/etc. For a large number of these people  lack of information  or fear of being different  or a host of other reasons  can force them to suppress what they feel and who they are for many years. I personally know a gay man who was married for decades to a woman  has children and grandchildren with her  and only came out to himself in his 50's.
