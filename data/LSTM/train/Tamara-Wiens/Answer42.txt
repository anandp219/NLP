Start with kissing  and non-sexual touching  and words of affection and desire  not obscene  just picking out things that you like about her  physically and non-physically. Telling me that I have a smile that lights up a room gets me interested and starting to be aroused. It's an art  to find the ways to arouse her that work best  but it's worth the time.Fourth  don't worry about your technique in penetration. While many women find penetration pleasurable  few women orgasm from intercourse alone.
