Simple arousal may be enough for many women  but many of us need oral stimulation as well  and a significant proportion require external lubrication as well. It may be too forward to show up with a bottle of lube (I recommend silicone based  as it lasts longest  leaves the least mess  and requires the least in application  but water based lubes are some of the most common)  so if the first time doesn't lead to intercourse because she's too dry  just be ready the next time - she likely will be as well  and many of us will appreciate your preparation.Last  relax.
