  I don't think that it's ever okay for anyone to retaliate. This is not to say that justice shouldn't be served  but justice is for the courts and the government to decide - anything else puts us into an anarchic  lynch mob scenario.If your husband or boyfriend cheats on you  then you have two options - you can forgive him and try to make it work with someone who has betrayed your trust  or you can leave him. If you retaliate  or even consider it  I don't understand the point - you have just created a situation where  if you stay together  you will both distrust the other.
