The reality is that all of those things are really spectra  and don't have any requirement to be "consistent" with the gender binary. For example  I know gay men who love drag and feminine presentation  I know trans men who present ambiguously and love women  I know straight women who love masculine clothes and activities  and I am a trans woman who presents very femininely and is in love with a woman. There isn't just one way to be  and you need to be aware of that.Definitely  the hardest situation to deal with is being trans - this is difficult for cis people to understand (both gay and straight - in fact  the gay community can be even more transphobic than the straights)  and being true to yourself requires a very visible transition  often involving hormone treatments and a number of expensive surgeries.
