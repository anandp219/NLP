I know a trans woman who was a bodybuilder and a bouncer. I know as many variations of expression of trans woman as there are of cis woman  if not more. Very few of us would fit all or even most of the stereotypical markers for trans women pre coming out. The only thing that we all share is a persistent feeling of not being identified as the correct gender.Your mother is just wrong.
