  I don't have any study based data for the specific question. Anecdotally  approximately 30% of couples in MtF transition stay together. As surgery is not a requirement of transition and isn't discussed or considered relevant in most conversations  it is harder to assess.Edited to address the completely independent question in the question details.Gender dysphoria and various areas of study related to the transgender community are relatively poorly covered from an academic and scientific research perspective.
