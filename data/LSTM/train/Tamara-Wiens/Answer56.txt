To an extent  women face the opposite problem - since marginalization of women is the norm  it's hard to understand the extent to which this negatively affects them.I don't say this with any rancor because until 3 years ago  I was that most fortunate of all humans  a fit white middle aged "man"  educated  employed  well off  in good health and with no personal issues to speak of... and I said and truly believed all of the things said in this question's details and much of what the MRA movement says.
