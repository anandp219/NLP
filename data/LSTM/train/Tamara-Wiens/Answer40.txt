  I would suggest a number of things.First  honesty  particularly in any relationship that you intend to be of any significant duration  is far  far better than lying or posing as something that you aren't. If you are a virgin when you first have physical relations with your paramour  and she has any experience  then she will know - it's hard to fake experience when you have exactly none.Second  ignore almost everything that you may have ever seen in porn movies. Pornography is performance sex  and you do NOT see the preparations  the adjustments  the annoyances and other things that go on off-camera to make porn orgasm worthy for the viewers.
