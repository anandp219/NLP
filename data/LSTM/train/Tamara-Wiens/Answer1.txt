  I would suggest  for more recent fiction  the Harry Potter series. Although the essentially total abandonment of Harry by all adults strikes a discordant note with adults and parents  it does bring out a lot of comments about resiliency and self-sufficiency. As well  Harry is constantly breaking the rules to do the right thing  sometimes not even of his own accord. This series was instrumental in encouraging my daughters to learn to read  and that love has stuck with them  in some form or another  despite the pervasiveness of electronic devices in their lives.
