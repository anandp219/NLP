  To be clear  the term is "Most Viewed Writer"  which is only one small dimension of the characterization of "top answerer". The problem is that Quora puts an inordinate amount of emphasis on "views"  as page views are what drive advertising revenue  and advertising is very likely to be one of their monetization approaches.Quora has moved to almost exclusively using bots and algorithms to do most of the moderation and "quality" verification on the site.
