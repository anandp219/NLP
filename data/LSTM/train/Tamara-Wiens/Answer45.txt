Sex is a SKILL  and like any skill  it takes time to learn. No one starts their sexual career as a Don Juan or Casanova - they needed lots of practice in seduction and arousal and other techniques to gain the reputations that they had. It won't come for you all at once  but if you pay attention to HER  far more than to you  then you will be successful  where success is measured by the amount of mutual pleasure experienced.Good luck!
