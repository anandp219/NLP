  Highly unlikely that you have B cup breasts in only 6 weeks. Most trans women starting HRT will only feel the start of breast buds by that point.The thing about breasts is that they take time for the glands to fully develop and for the fatty tissue to accumulate. I suspect that you either had a fair bit of chest fat before HRT  or that you are mis-estimating the size of what you do have.Then again  maybe you did get to a B cup in 6 weeks. If so  I recommend that you talk to your endocrinologist  as this may indicate an issue that needs monitoring.
