  I have 4 daughters  and I came out to them when they were 19  18  16 and 14. I had fully transitioned only 10 months later.It has  like everything else about transitioning  been a mixed bag. On the one hand  I am happy that my delayed coming out and transition allowed me to have children at this point in my life. They are the solitary blessing in my life  and their love is one of the very few things that keeps me going from day to day.Of course  it has presented its own challenges. It required that I also come out to them  and to do so in a way that would make sense to them.
