  I first realized that I wasn't "normal" when I was in my late teens - somewhere between 16 and 18  I started to research hormones  because I knew that testosterone was not my friend  and I desperately wanted estrogen instead. However  that was as far as it went until I was 45  and I finally confronted my lifelong feelings about gender. At that point  after a 2 week vacation in which I did nothing but eat  sleep  and read/think beside the pool  I knew that I needed to be true to myself  the one that had been trying to get out for almost 30 years.At that point  I came out to myself as a crossdresser  probably because being a CD seems much less scary - you don't have to give up much of anything  and probably nothing public  unless you want to.
