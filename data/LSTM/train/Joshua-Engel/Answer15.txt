  The scene exists solely in the movie; it is not a scene from the book. The lyrics are taken from a completely different scene.I thought the music was haunting  and Boyd sang it beautifully. The moment was quite affecting. However  I didn't care for the way it depicted Denethor as a gluttonous tyrant and a horrible father. Denethor is not a monster; he was in fact a wise ruler. His fault was in giving in to despair  a serious no-no in Catholicism and in Tolkien's world. I don't necessarily disapprove of changing the character from the book.
