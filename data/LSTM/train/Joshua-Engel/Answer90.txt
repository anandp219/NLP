"Standard English" is a consensus; when the consensus breaks down  the standard changes. "Processeez" is considered a nonstandard pronunciation by most dictionaries  presumably because that particular mis-generalization is restricted to certain areas. It would make sense (but I have no data) if it's more common among technical people who get more exposure to words with Greek roots. (Greek words in English tend to have a technical feel; they were imported primarily in academic contexts.) I'm sure it'll prove yet another pet peeve among language prescriptivists because "being peeved" is what prescriptivists do.
