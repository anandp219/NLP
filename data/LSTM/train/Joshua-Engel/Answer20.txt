  No. Even without a picture  the odds are so overwhelmingly against it being anything of interest that just plain "no" suffices.And even with a picture  it's practically impossible to tell. There are zillions of fungi in the world  many of them nearly identical to other ones. Even experienced mushroom hunters occasionally get fooled into eating something toxic. A picture will not suffice to make a determination.Unless you're an expert  you'd be best off leaving it alone. Even if you are an expert  you'd be better off doing lab tests before consuming something that you hope will mess with your brain chemistry.
