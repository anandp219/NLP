  Among physicists  the answer is "neither one". General relativity and quantum mechanics have differing views of time  but neither one of them is usefully classed as either "real" or an illusion. In both  guided by special relativity  time is inextricably linked to space; the portion of "spacetime" as time and which is space is determined by relative motion. Relativistic quantum mechanics preserves this via Lorentz invariance. Fully handling accelerating frames requires a curved spacetime  via general relativity  with a different metric.As for what philosophers accept... honestly  who gives a flying fuck what philosophers think of time?
