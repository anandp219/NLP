  If it's Turing complete  then it's equivalent to a language with conditional statements. There will exist some transformation from a language that does have conditional statements to the language in question.You can code that up in an arbitrary number of ways. For example  the SKI combinator calculus is Turing complete  and there's nothing obviously corresponding to a conditional in its three functions:Ix=xKxy=xSxyz=xz(yz)From here  you can implement NOT=(SK)(K)  and K corresponds to an OR structure.
