When they tried isolating some of those elements for Into Darkness  they failed miserably  precisely because they didn't have the time to make the relationships count.So a well-built TV series is  for me  a much better idea than more movies. It has a better chance of tapping into the Trek spirit  of a very big universe filled with exciting ideas and new ways to look at ourselves. That doesn't guarantee success; as Voyager and Enterprise showed there are plenty of ways to do it wrong. But if it can manage to be even as successful as TNG  that would be a pretty big win for the sci-fi world.
