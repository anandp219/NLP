They carry far more energy than that; the rest mass is so small a fraction of it that we've never managed to measure it. We only know that it exists at all because massless particles can't change their type like that  but all that tells us is that the mass is non-zero.The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is different from the observer effect. The uncertainty in momentum and position are fundamental  not properties of the observation. That is  it's not just that the measurement disturbs the particle (although it does).
