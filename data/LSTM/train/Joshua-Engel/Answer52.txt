That writer listened to the stories of the Elves  who supposedly lived on the island that is now Britain  and those stories were to be a kind of reconstructed fairy tale of a pre-Saxon (and pre-Roman) culture of Elves. Their language was free of Anglo-Saxon influence  and in fact came down directly from the "gods" (after much phonological shift  another thing Tolkien was fascinated by). The Welsh and Finnish influences were inspiration to Tolkien  rather than to the characters in the story.The frame story of the Danish traveler speaking Old English vanished around the time Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings  and does not appear in the published works.
