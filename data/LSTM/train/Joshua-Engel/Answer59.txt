  I agree that quantum teleportation is not teleportation in any meaningful sense of the word.What quantum teleportation does do is allow you to separate the quantum and classical parts of a quantum state and send that separately. Suppose you have an electron whose state you want to send somewhere else. And suppose you have a pair of entangled particles; call them A and B.You can use A to take a measurement of the electron. That yields you some result that you can write down and send (by email  carrier pigeon  FedEx  etc.)
