  The "observer effect" in quantum physics is generally confused with the Uncertainty principle  which is a more rigorous and better-defined idea.The "observer effect" is a classical notion that you have to interact with something to get data out of it  and that that interaction will of necessity have some kind of effect. Often  the effect is small enough to ignore  though on quantum scales it's it's hard to make something "small enough to ignore". Neutrinos don't particularly help you achieve that goal  because the size of their rest mass isn't particularly relevant.
