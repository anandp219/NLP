  Nothing. At least  nothing that's not also wrong with "natural" flavors.Artificial flavors tend to be purer  which makes the flavor less complex. Sometimes  that can be useful: in some applications artificial vanilla works better than natural vanilla because it carries the primary vanilla note more clearly.There's nothing toxic about them. They are usually purer forms of flavors found in the natural world  chemically identical. There's nothing especially safe about the natural versions. Some natural flavors  like Coumarin  have been banned from food for being dangerous.
