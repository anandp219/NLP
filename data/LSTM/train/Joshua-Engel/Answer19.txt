  We have no data  not even in the unpublished material. Given the complete lack of any mention of him in the Third Age it seems likely that he left the Round World. Presumably  that puts him in Aman by process of elimination.For all we know he could be hanging around today; the Valar are pretty good at not being seen when they want to be. And I assume that they can go back and forth  if they wish. But mostly  the age of the Valar in Middle-earth seems to be over  and Ulmo is not specifically excepted.
