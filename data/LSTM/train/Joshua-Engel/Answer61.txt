No mass or energy has been moved  just some quantum information. You had to get particle B there somehow  as well as the information you emailed/fexed/pigeoned. These are purely classical operations. It would have been far  far easier just to mail your electron.It's interesting in that you didn't have to mail the electron  just the entangled particles (which could be photons). But you still haven't really sent anywhere near enough to make an actual object  which is going to be on the order of 10^25 times more complicated.
