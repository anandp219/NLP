  A movie doesn't need a message. In fact  it probably shouldn't have one. Tolkien explicitly disavowed having one in The Lord of the Rings:As for any inner meaning or 'message'  it has in the intention of the author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical.Films are there to entertain. The Lord of the Rings and 300 do so in very different ways. I'd say that they actually have practically nothing to do with each other. If there is some trope that's common to the two of them ("sacrifice")  it's something they have in common with thousands of other films.
