  As far as I can tell  nobody has ever given this footnote a moment's thought. This was written in 1920  and since then  quantum electrodynamics has provided the electrodyanmic theory that Einsten felt was missing. It does not allow for "electrical masses" that need to be held together by additional forces. They are excitations of the electromagnetic field under the U(1) gague symmetry. This is a formulation completely unknown to Einstein at the time he wrote this (and indeed  was not developed until just before his death).
