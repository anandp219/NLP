  None whatsoever.If I had to fabricate something  I'd mention the The Earl of Essex Rebellion  which tried to use one of Shakespeare's plays (Richard II) to (somehow) foment a rebellion. The rebellion failed so miserably that it's hard to imagine what the hell they were thinking. But (a) Shakespeare was not involved in the plot  (b) even if he were  it's a completely different plot from the Gunpowder Plot.The Gunpowder Plot was led by Catholics  and Shakespeare's father was Catholic. Some say Shakespeare was himself  in fact.
