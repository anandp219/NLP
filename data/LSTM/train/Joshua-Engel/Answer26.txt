When the density is sufficiently high  the HUP doesn't exactly apply  either. That's an approximation that works at relatively low energy levels  like you see now. But it has to be replaced with something different to understand even something like the conditions inside the LHC  much less the early universe. That "replacement" isn't nearly as neatly expressed as the uncertainty principle  at least not without forms of mathematics that few are familiar with.So studying quantum mechanics is the best way to learn to ask the right questions and get on the right path  but it's not the whole answer.
