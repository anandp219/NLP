  Yes  but mostly insofar as it helps you understand that the notion of "origin of the universe" isn't as clear as the expression makes it sound.People have a strong intuitive notion that mass and time and space and momentum are well defined concepts  and that you can meaningfully say things like "An object is here at time t  therefore at t-1 it must have been over there." And that's perfectly reasonable for everything you've ever encountered.But the world of the very  very small doesn't work like that.
