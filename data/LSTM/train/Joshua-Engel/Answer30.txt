  No  it didn't rot  it oxidized. The red color of meat is caused by myoglobin. The myoglobin degrades over time  especially on exposure to oxygen  turning brown. You bought it in a package that was flushed with modified air to keep it bright red. (Sometimes including a small amount of carbon monoxide  which isn't harmful but can cause meat to appear fresh even after it has degraded.) When you opened the package  parts of it were exposed in a way that caused it to degrade the myoglobin.It was going to turn gray when you cooked it anyway.
