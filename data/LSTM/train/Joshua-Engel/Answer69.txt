You would probably be healthier eating more "whole"  unprocessed foods... and neither natural nor artificial flavors contribute to that.Consumers have a distaste for the "artificial" label  and food processors generally seek out the "natural" ones  but it's not really helping. Sometimes it does help the food taste better  by providing more complex tastes  but it's not improving the nutrition.
