The dam is actually physically anchored to the walls on both sides.Also  a dam is generally wider at the base than at the top  like this levee:"River Levee Cross Section Figure".

Even if the dam weren't anchored to the earth  it would be hard to tip over because the angle of the force drives it down into the earth  which has been compacted to resist pressure.
