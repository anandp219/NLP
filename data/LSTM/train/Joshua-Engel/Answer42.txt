Even that practical limit is unreachable on earth  where you're living a mere 8 light minutes from a star pumping out a lot of heat  and a body that has been storing up that heat for five billion years and come to a rough equilibrium. That will limit the efficiency of any heat engine you try to operate. Your cold sink will be around 300K  or perhaps 30-50 degrees colder if you seek out a really cold place. That's a long way from zero.
