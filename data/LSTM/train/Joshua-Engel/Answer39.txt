  I think that the best way to visualize the second law is via the notion of a Heat engine. A heat engine does work when energy flows from a hot place to a cold place.That asymmetry between hot and cold is the basis of a directionality in the universe. The totality of "hotness" in the universe relative to "coldness" is a quantity we can keep track of. That quantity is "entropy"  and it can only increase. As the universe winds its way along  it goes from having more states with heat and cold widely separated  to having heat and cold distributed more equally.
