  It's effectively impossible to predict. Climate change affects whole ecosystems  involving a vast web of organisms: plants  animals  insects  bacteria. Each organism will be affected in its own way: later flowering  earlier migration  different metabolic requirements  altered soil bacteria mix. It's an insanely complex feedback system. Each individual organism's response to the change in temperature is likely to be fairly small. It might move its range a few miles  or a few meters in altitude.
