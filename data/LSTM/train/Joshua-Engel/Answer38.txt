There are some ethics professors who get some radio airtime (like Peter Singer)  or meaning-of-life philosophers like David Chalmers (whose work I consider a vapid pile of drivel and a stain on academic philosophy).So there are lots of philosophers. It's just that the famous ones aren't called philosophers. There's actually some very good work being done  in an incremental way that doesn't attract much attention. They're not going to be famous  but historically speaking  practically none ever were.
