They tell you to start it in hot water to make the cooking time more consistent  but really  the goal is to recognize the difference between undercooked noodles and cooked noodles  which is best done with your eyes and your teeth. The main thing here: don't get worked up over "recipes". 90% of cooking is taking ingredients and making them hot. There are a few basic ways to make them hot: with direct heat from a pan  in a box full of hot air  in a bunch of water. As you get comfortable with these techniques you can optimize  but if you're in a position to be asking me for beginner recipes  the main lesson is "forget the recipes".
