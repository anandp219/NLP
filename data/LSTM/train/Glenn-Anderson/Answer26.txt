It makes no allowances for other mechanisms such as Exaptation. This is the process where a trait originally evolved with one function  is coopted to be used in an entirely different way. Quoting from the above Wikipedia entry:There are many examples of exaptations. A classic example is how feathers  which initially evolved for heat regulation  were co-opted for display  and later co-opted for use in bird flight.In fact  one of Behe's iconic examples of this  the moustrap  has been shown to be reducible.
