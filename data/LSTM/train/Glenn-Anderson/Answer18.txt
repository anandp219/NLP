  Well  with those criteria  there is only one language choice: JavaScript. This is an absolute necessity if you're going to do any work on the web. And fortunately  it is an option on many of that other stuff.Of course  the real choice will be decided by an actual project. For instance  if you're working on any sort of enterprise system that has been around for any length of time  and you're not doing any frontend work  you may end up having to use Java.You really can't pick one language and hope it fits all niches and opportunities.
