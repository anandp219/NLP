Rushed. Probably closer to six if you care about the code. And if you think you'll get a guy to do both front and backends  more than likely one set of skills will suffer  because either domain is large enough. And since you have a largely complete backend  that's also going to limit possible candidates. If you do find a single engineer that is equally proficient on both front and backends  that backend better be in the same technologies he's good with. The most likely scenario here is that you will find an engineer who is good with the backend technologies and thinks he can muddle through the frontend well enough.
