. . .The theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological. In this case it is not only testable  but it turns out to be not strictly universally true. To be more specific  when examining if a gene is under selective pressure  the hypothesis of natural selection can be compared to Neutral Theory: The Null Hypothesis of Molecular Evolution. Natural selection of genes is not tautological  it can actually be tested without assuming itself. the violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics- described as axiomatic to evolutionary thinking.This is a less forgivable misunderstanding  as it simply represents sloppy thinking.
