A ring species is a gradient of populations which can interbreed with their neighbors  but the furthest ends cannot produce fertile offspring. If the two ends of this series of populations meet  for instance the gradient wrapping around a geological feature  such as a mountain range  they appear to be two different species. For example the Ensatina salamanders of the american pacific coast:In this case  the species migrated from north to south  with different populations branching around the central valley.
