  It's never too late. I know people at your age or older who have started their careers as software engineers. To get a jump start  you might consider a boot camp like Hack Reactor. My company frequently hires Hack Reactor grads. However  there's no reason to wait  you should start learning right now. Everything you need to get started is available online now. There is so much more information at your fingertips than when I started many moons ago. You should pretty quickly discover if you have a knack for it and whether you enjoy it or not.Good luck.
