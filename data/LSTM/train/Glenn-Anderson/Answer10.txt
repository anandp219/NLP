  I'm 49 and have been able to stay continuously employed. I've got a focus on the front-end which is incredibly hot right now. Although there are a bunch of people with JavaScript on their resume  there are very few who are any good at it  or come from a traditional engineering background.In addition  I've always had personal projects  from a Facebook game to my own Single Page Application framework written in node. I use these projects as a whetstone  to keep my skills well honed.Although keeping a broad skill set is certainly useful  it is most useful as a knowledge and experience base rather than as a selling tool to get yourself a job.
