When they meet on the other side  the divergence in populations gives us two different species.So  were neanderthals a separate species? Well  based on anatomy  they are different enough that they are classed that way. And the gene flow between the different populations appears to be minimal. But because species is such a fuzzy concept  it doesn't really matter. The labels are convenient.
