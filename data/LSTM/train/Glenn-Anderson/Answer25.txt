  This is my original flippant answerBecause these severe flaws are imaginary. Evolution is taught because it is the cornerstone of modern biology  and to leave it out of education would be near criminal. Why do you hate children?I'm going to make this much richer  since the details were added.By flaws I mean things like irreducible complexityThe problem with irreducible complexity is that it assumes a certain model of evolution  while ignoring other paths. IC assumes that evolution happens by the incremental addition of parts.
