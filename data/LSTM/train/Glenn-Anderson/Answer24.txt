Don't do it. Frontend tech is hard. It is way too easy to get a tangled mess when a backend engineer tries to jump in and do it with little to no experience. Of course it goes the other way as well. Frontend engineers don't usually understand the complexities of building a scalable backend. So  you should get dedicated frontend and backend engineers. Of course  if you don't really care about the long term viability of the code  all this goes out the window. Just pay a highschool kid $1000 to rip it out in a weekend and then throw it away when done.
