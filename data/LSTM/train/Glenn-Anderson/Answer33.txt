What do you think makes more sense  that all these experts with decades of education and research experience are wrong and you are right. Or that they may know somethings that you do not?These severe flaws. Why are these blindly skimmed over or simply omitted altogether?Because  these flaws are nonexistent. They are the product of religious leaders who have a vested  emotional interest in this particular science being wrong.I'm not attempting to troll here  I'm legitimately asking why this has been so widely taught despite very obvious and serious problems behind the smoke and mirrors.
