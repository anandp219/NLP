I feel my roots are in Rajasthan and I'm proud of it as well as I love my Andhra and everyone says "I'm more a Southie " and I'm proud of that too.Marwari guys- Eeeuuukkk  no offence but so so so I dislike.Yes  it does create ruffles at home from marriage perspectives. My parents show me marwari prospective guys and all I feel is "eh! Eeeuuu." Having said all of that  it really doesn't matter who  what  where the person is from because bottom line is WE ARE ALL HUMANS.Love is beyond borders  colour  race  caste and gender.
