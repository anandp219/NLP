  I feel bad for:1. Modi  no matter how much good he wants to do  he will have to do the dirty work of letting reservations be.2. I feel disgusted and sympathetic to all the people who *USE* reservations.And I just believe more in the fact that no matter how good you are  you may be the the prime minister of a powerful nation like India but you will bend in to absurd stuff and bend to people just because of their caste. *talk about pseudo - equality. *And thereby people like you and me (OCs) should just be glad we don't need to slave to them.
