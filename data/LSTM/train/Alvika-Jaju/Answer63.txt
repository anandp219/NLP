If you're scared about if it's be equally or less or more special /good for her...let me tell you this second hand from my friends who have had premartial sex. "It is great! Because here it is blessed with the vows of marriage!" And for a girl that matters the MOST! Because whatever was in the past is gone wooshhh and doesn't matter.A very lovely line by Vishnu Komma "The problems of your past are your business.The problems of your future are my privilege". Beautiful lines...say it and see how she respects and loves you.
