  No.If apples and oranges were the same. They wouldn't be called apples and oranges.There are something men are better at and some women. I embrace that fact.These are some qualities  not that all men and women can be categorised such.1.Men are much more physically stronger and in some areas even mentally too!Women are much more caring and can express out love  care more easily. 2.Men are more analytical.Women more intuitional or say emotional.3. When it comes to being determined my vote goes to women.
