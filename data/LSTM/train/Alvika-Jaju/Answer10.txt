  To love feels exhilarating  calm!Peaceful and excitement!It's like opening your heart mind and soul to the person  giving him every power to hurt you to death and trusting him enough that he won't!It's like "okay! This person annoys me to insanity and I still want him! "It's like "Anybody who hurts him/her/them WILL FACE MY WRATH! "It's feels happy being with them. Because THEY MATTER. It doesn't always feel rosey and shiny BUT normalcy is good with them.Trust! Trust that despite having hormones that go wacky  they wouldn't stare at opposite gender or cross tge line.
