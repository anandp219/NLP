If you compare with somebody else. You'll never be happy.If you compare with something else.You'll not be satisfied.If you compare with yourself and get over ambitious.You'll feel depressed.Everybody needs to do their work  that's a fact! Like it or not.So  do what you can do and make sure you are ALWAYS HAPPY AND HAVING FUN WHILE OR INBETWEEN DOING IT.Study for 2 hours.
