I'm studying  searching for job  pursuing my hobbies  building myself  helping people  achieving many things (loads yet to be done).Are they weird? No.Am I weird? No.Just different people. Some raise questions. Brush them off. Some appreciate me  I prefer being with them. Some tell me straight when I'm wrong  I listen and ponder.Choose people. There are all similar just different to different people.
