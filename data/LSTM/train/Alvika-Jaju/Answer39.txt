  Thanks for A2A Pooja Patel.People working in NASA  army and defence have a personal life too.1. Balance it out. 2. Be honest. When you're busy say you're busy and ask him to be honest too! It's that simple! 3. There are people in tge army who don't talk to their better half's for days to months. You're into CA  and if he is in CA too... Both of you will understand. All you need to do is *say* it  "I'm busy. Shall we talk later?" If he's not into CA then explain it to him that you're a bear and go into hibernation every six months may and November.Both of you love each other with a little adjust  understand and be honest about it can easily manage.There are Hardworkers who get married.Edit: I believe that there is no superior feeling than love.
