Share your greatness  share what you have and I think you'll be happy. Be happy in what you do  whatever you do... and see greatness will come to you.Funny part? Greatness might lead to greed.Happiness leads to sharing and leads to more happiness.I was commuting the other day  the traffic was moving slow. There was a little girl learning to sew clothes. I leaned over from my vehicle and by action expressed out "wow. Very beautiful!" YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE SMILE SHE HAD!It made my day! I made someone smile!
