  I was so close to getting exhausted with things mounting in my mind.I was losing desire to eat  taste (I'm a foodie so you can imagine)  my energy to just sit and work hard was depleting.The thought of living 40-45 more years felt so heavy! Ah!Then my loved ones told me "I love you! Love you so much! "God  my Sai  in his own ways held me.My brother hugged me. My mother kissed me. My father put his hand on my hand and smiled.And I realised I've got to live. I've got to work hard. The problems were in my mind.
