  I'm no expert. I'm not married.- Disclaimer.What I do know is that when we love someone we don't put a clause  do we? That so and so should do this or that.We just love and express it in our own ways some by writing letters  poems some by in their little and big gestures like taking out time amidst hectic work schedule  just saying I love you  helping etc.I'm sure he must have expressed in some ways.Then due to work load or stress these might come down. But you both are there together  love each other and that matters.Coming to your solution: It's very very simple!
