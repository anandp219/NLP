  Thanks for the A2A. I've been in this situation a few times. Both  when I have interviewed internally for other jobs  and then when members of my team were doing so. I've also interviewed people in other groups for my team. It can be an awkward situation  so do your best to keep it brief  professional and positive.Keep in mind that your manager may already know. Usually when members of my team were interviewing  I had an idea either that they weren't happy or something was up. Also  if it the new role is one that makes natural sense for you  it may be obvious.
