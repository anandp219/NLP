Do not use this opportunity to say anything bad about your current role. Remember that this person is still your manager  and may continue to be so for awhile. If your manager asks why you are thinking about changing teams  keep your answer brief and neutral. A couple years ago someone on my team told me that they wanted to move to a different role at the company. They said that they felt it "was a much better fit for them." They then went on for about 10 minutes about everything they didn't like about my team  and how much better the other team was.
