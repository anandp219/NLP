  Fear of missing out (FOMO) is an interesting psychological phenomena. And it doesn't just relate to a Friday night party or that next hot Tinder date. FOMO can be costing you money. Seriously. Understanding FOMO can save you heartache and dollars. In behavioral economics  and decision theory  the psychology behind FOMO can be partially explained by loss aversion. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman demonstrated people's strong tendency to want to avoid any losses. In fact  the research suggests that losses are twice as impactful on people  psychologically  as gains.
