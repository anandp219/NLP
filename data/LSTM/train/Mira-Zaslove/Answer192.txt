Often at small companies  there are a few amazing individuals  ideas  or products  who keep the entire company afloat. Ive seen companies where the top sales guy brought in enough to pay all the bills. This is possible with a small team. Not so much when company grows 10x. Analogous issues can be found with industries -- restaurants  photographers  designers  etc. -- that rely heavily on one persons vision. If the company is paying too much to retain customers  relying too much on manual processes  or is unable to train employees  these can be scalability red flags.Leadership is not goodCulture comes from the top.
