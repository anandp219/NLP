Stick to 10 minutes  or less. People are busy. Respect your audience's time. Start the presentation promptly  and plan to end a bit early. Watch your pacing throughout the presentation and make sure you aren't spending too much time on any one point. By giving yourself a buffer  you'll avoid rushing towards the end. If you have a few minutes left  let the audience know you will stick around if they have any follow up questions or comments. Don't run late  it can inconvenience your audience and leave people feeling rushed and anxious -- not the feelings you want the audience to feel leaving your presentation.
