I got an MRI to make sure that I didn't have a blood clot. Thankfully it was temporary  but I wasn't prepared for it. Even after the swelling goes down  a few of my friends found that they no longer fit into their old shoes. This is because ligaments throughout the body can be loosened during pregnancy  causing feet to spread. Postpartum is brutal. The six weeks after giving birth are rough. But not because of the excess weight. Between putting baby down  picking baby up  and carrying around 8 lbs all day  you burn a lot of calories.
