The first step in achieving your dreams  is to turn them into concrete and reachable goals. If you don't know where want to go  you probably won't get there! Be specific. Don't just say  "I want to be the boss." First you need to clearly define what being the boss means to you  and then set out a plan. Write down and visualize realistic benchmarks.2. Know what you don't wantThink of nothing else. Cut out all time and energy spent on anything that doesn't further your dreams. Don't get distracted by things that don't matter.
