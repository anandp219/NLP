It is unlikely graduating from a top school alone will get you hired  promoted  or funded. Sure  the stamp of approval can help  but it is doubtful to be the main factor. Once you are in the working world  most people don't care much at all. Each job you get after college  what school you went to will matter less and less. I went to Brown University  and I graduated around 15 years ago. So it's been awhile. In my last 2 job interviews nobody asked what college I went to. I have no idea what college the Director  or VP of my group went to.
