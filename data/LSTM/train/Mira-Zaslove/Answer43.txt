Again  your goal is always safety  not holding onto your ATM card or money. Most ATMs have video cameras  so if they start to attack you  point at the camera to distract them  and run. Remain calm and confident. If you frequently go to unsafe areas  and know of people getting mugged in your area  have a decoy "muggers" wallet  with only a small amount of real money and outdated / old credit cards. If you are accosted  hand over the decoy wallet  to satisfy the thief  and get out of the situation quickly.
