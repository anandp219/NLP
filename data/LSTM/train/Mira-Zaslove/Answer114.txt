  Whether or not a good salesperson will make a good sales manager has a lot to do with the culture they are in  and their ability to adapt and change. Good salespeople are competitive. Sadly  often even more competitive with members of their own team  than they are with external competitors. Many good salespeople get good by focusing only on their numbers at the expense of everything  and everyone  else. When they get promoted to management  many salespeople with this mentality  will find it difficult to change their way of thinking.Typically in sales  each person is only responsible for their own quota.
