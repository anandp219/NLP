As soon as the dice came to a stop  the judges were asked whether they would sentence the woman to a term in prison greater or lesser  in months  than the number showing on the dice. Finally  the judges were instructed to specify the exact prison sentence they would give to the shoplifter. On average  those who had rolled a 9 said they would sentence her to 8 months; those who rolled a 3 said they would sentence her to 5 months; the anchoring effect was 50%.Crazy thing about this outcome of the die roll?
