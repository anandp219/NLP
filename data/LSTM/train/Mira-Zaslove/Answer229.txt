The Director  VP  and GM of the IT department are all Indian. Most of their spouses  are also Indians in technology. Indian consultants from WiPro  Infosys  Tata Consulting  and other contracting groups have replaced full time local employees. Walk into any IT department of almost any major tech firm  and you will see more Indians than any other immigrant population. You will often find more Indians than Americas. Indians have conquered Silicon Valley.So  if you ask me: Indians ARE creating technology.
