3. Don't run late or procrastinateIt's easy to feel impatient when you are running late. Time never goes slower than when you need to be somewhere and are stuck in traffic. 30 seconds can seem like half an hour. So  if you are known to run late  make an effort to be on time or early. Similarly  don't procrastinate. If there is something that you have to do  just get it over with. It causes impatience when you feel like there is something hanging over your head. The calm and relaxed mind is a more patient mind  so prioritize what you need to do  and do the most important things first thing.
