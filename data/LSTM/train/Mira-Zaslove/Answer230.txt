The CEO of Microsoft (Satya Nadella)  the co-founder of Sun Microsystems and one of the most successful VCs (Vinod Khosla) are Indian. Rajen Sheth  the founder of Google Apps  is Indian. Yes  it is true that many of these individuals are Americans with Indian heritage. However  a large majority of them are also immigrants. I think it is meaningful  because I do not see this type of technological dominance with other ethnic groups. Indians are also beginning to leverage their success abroad and are bringing it back to India.
