For an Indian  arranged marriage is very common.In India  some form of dowry is still common  and culturally expected in many cases. In the US  a man (and his family!) would get a shock if they expected gifts or money from a girl's family. It can still be culturally expected for a bride's family to pay for the wedding  but generally the couple  and both sets of parents chip in. Also  I've never seen a bride's family give the groom or his family gold sets or cash money before  during  or after the wedding.
