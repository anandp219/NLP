Inexperienced managers will often have to learn these skills. Motivating people is also not "one size fits all " and inexperienced managers often learn the hard way that what works motivating one person  will not work with another. Surprisingly  I found that people are more motivated to compete when there are fewer competitors  so if you are looking to motivate your team through competition  separate them into smaller teams. When I was first promoted to a manager  my inexperience  and my ego made it difficult for me to share  and ultimately  give away the spotlight.
