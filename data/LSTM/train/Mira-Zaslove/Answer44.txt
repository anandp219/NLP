Whenever possible:Go to the ATM during the day  preferably during relatively busy timesUse popular ATMs in well trafficked areas that you are familiar withIf you need an ATM at night  go to a grocery store  buy something small  and get cash backBring someone with you Be as fast and efficient as possibleDon't count your cash in publicDon't get a receipt to check your balance -- do it online or inside the bank branch insteadPut your cash and ATM card away immediatelyDon't listen to earphones  make a phone call  text  or look at your phoneRemain alert and mind your own business
