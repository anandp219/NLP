If you are on H-1B visa and want to move to another job  again you will need the new company to transfer your visa. Not every company will do it  and this could limit your prospects. Smaller companies and new start-ups aren't always as familiar and comfortable with the process  and may not sponsor you. Many Indians are therefore more conservative with their jobs and careers. They gravitate towards  and stay longer  at safer jobs  because they can't afford to take as much risk. If an Indian gets laid off  or the company they work for goes bust  they will need to quickly find another employment sponsor.
