Bernie Sanders is showing some strength and doing a lot better than expected. However  he is no Barack Obama. He'll likely win a few early states  but he is not a plausible alternative to Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Sanders  like House Arryn  is the principled house-- seated in a small castle  which is located far  far away at the top of a remote mountain. The Republican nomination is another story all together. Jeb Bush is arguably still the Republican front runner  and House Bush -- Like House Lannister  is formidable.
