If you lose your temper and go off the rails on your co-workers  work on it. If people continually say your biggest weaknesses is your toxic / hurtful/ or abusive behavior  take the feedback seriously  and work on improving. In this case  you will probably be too big of a liability to promote  and the minute your performance starts to slip  there will be a good reason to let you go. Bullying  humiliating  or yelling at your co-workers is not acceptable. Some people with hot tempers are super successful  and you might get away with it.
