According to Jaideep Prabhu  a professor at Cambridge Judge Business School  The term brain drain is misleading because really we are in an era of brain circulation. Prabhu argues that the Surprising Secret of Indias Success Could Be its Brain Drain. He studied 116 Indian companies  and found:Leaders who had studied and worked abroad had a competitive advantage. This international edge helped them expand rapidly in developed markets  despite a lack of experience peddling their products and services in the West.The data suggests that pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy Laboratories  software and outsourcing company Infosys  refining company Reliance Industries  the Mahindra Group and Indias largest conglomerate the Tata group  all benefited from having executives who had spent time studying or working overseas.
