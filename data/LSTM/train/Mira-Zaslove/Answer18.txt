Yet  Richard Nixon's legacy is more mixed than an other US president on the "worst list." Nixon is considered bad by both parties  but liberals tend to view him as worse than conservatives. Richard Nixon was the first American president to visit communist China and he is given credit for opening relations with what is today  America's most important trade partner. Surprisingly  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) were also created on Nixon's watch.
