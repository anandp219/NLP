For instance  the Zillion Dollar Lobster Frittata (yes  it is actually called that!) at Normas at the Parker Meridien hotel in New York City. The regular frittata  made with a pound lobster  includes 1 oz of Sevruga caviar for $100  while the "Norma Dares You to Expense This" higher-rollers version  comes with 10 oz for $1 000. Notice too  how Norma's doesn't include the $ sign  or any decimals. To minimize price sensitivity  manipulative menus  omit $ signs  or any mention of cents. Anchor decoys are often highlighted by being placed in prime space  or in different colors  where the eye naturally goes.
