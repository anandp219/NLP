  Depends on what your strengths and weaknesses are  how major they are  who they impact  and how easy they are to improve.Generally  I would say it is best to focus on your strengths. I spent many years as a manager  and would much rather my team focus on improving what they are already good at  than working on things they aren't. And I'm going to tell you a dirty secret about the performance review: don't focus on becoming the well rounded employee. When I managed teams  my best performers were often my worst performers in certain areas.For instance  on my Sales and Trading team  one of my guys who always hit quota  was continually late  missed a lot of work  and was often MIA during the day.
