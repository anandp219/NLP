This is your time to craft your message  so don't bring up anything negative! Even if you are reaching for the job  give an introduction that shows why you deserve it. Never talk yourself out of a job or hedge in the first few minutes. For example:If you are a recent college graduate  highlight internships  hobbies  or college projects that relate to the job. If you are making a career switch  highlight your positive attributes and transferable skills.If you are looking to make the move to management  highlight specific examples of how you have motivated and led teams.For a few examples of other things to avoid: see Mira Zaslove's answer to What are some of the biggest red flags in an interviewee?If you have been referred to the company by a current employee  it is appropriate to mention that they got you excited about the position.
