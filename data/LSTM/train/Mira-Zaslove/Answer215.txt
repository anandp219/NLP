"Attached" is the correct word for e-mail & electronic communication. Enclosed  is more frequently associated with physical mail. Finally  "find" has more than one meaning  and using it doesn't necessarily mean that something is lost. "Please find attached" is letting the reader know that something is attached in the email. And yes  this can be necessary  as some people really do miss that little paperclip icon denoting an attachment.
