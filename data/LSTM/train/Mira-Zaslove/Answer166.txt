Many of the most brutal and ruthless people start out kind  and compassionate until someone gives them a reason to distrust. In the words of Al Capone:Don't mistake my kindness for weakness. I am kind to everyone  but when someone is unkind to me  weak is not what you are going to remember about me. When you are dealing with someone who doesn't have your best interest in mind  be ruthless in defending against attack. Be careful though not to be vindictive or petty. Protect yourself and move on. It doesn't do any good to hold onto silly or meaningless grudges.
