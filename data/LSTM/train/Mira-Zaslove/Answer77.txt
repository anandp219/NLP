If graduating from a top college really matters to you  then go for it. Apply to as many schools as you can. It's a numbers and luck game. I got rejected from one of my "safety" schools  and many people I know got into schools they never thought they would  and rejected from others they assumed were sure bets. Diversify. Apply to as many top schools as you can (preferably in all geographies)  and if you don't get in the first time  apply again as a transfer student. Keep applying until you get in.
