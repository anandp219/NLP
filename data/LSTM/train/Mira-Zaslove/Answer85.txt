Bernhard Caesar  also became a physicist and shared Albert's ability to play the violin. Bernhard Caeser's second son  Paul Michael Einstein  also inherited the love of playing and Bernhard Caesar gave him Albert's violin. Today Paul Michael lives in the South of France  where he is a professional composer and violinist. In 2004  Paul Michael performed Mozarts Sonata in E Minor  Alberts favorite piece  at the German Physical Societys celebration of Albert Einsteins 125th birthday. All of Einstein's descendants didn't inherit Einstein's IQ  but many of them did inherit his love of music and ability to play the violin.
