Don't be afraid to speak up and be direct. It's surprising how much you can get buy just asking. Give people a convincing reason to help you. People respond to passion and conviction. When people ask how you are doing  and if they can help  be prepared with a positive and clear answer. Your network and resources will be more supportive  when you are able to clearly articulate how they can help you. And when people help you  be grateful for their support. Help others  and support their dreams. Celebrate the success you see around you.
