It's also impossible to be a great negotiator without hearing no  and putting yourself out there. You are going to get rejected. So  top negotiators are comfortable with risk and ok handling rejection. Top negotiators are persistent  and don't quit when it gets tough or when they are told "no." The more adversarial and draining the negotiation  the more likely the party with more stamina will win. Zero-sum negotiation is often a game of chicken. And better negotiators dont cave  or quit. Perseverance pays off.
