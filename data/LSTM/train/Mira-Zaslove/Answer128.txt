  Common mistakes new managers make have a lot to do with their ability to adapt and change. People who get promoted to management are often competitive and often got promoted by focusing only on their own performance. When they get promoted to management  many people find it difficult to change. As an individual performer  typically  the harder you work  the more successful you are. Management  however  is not so simple. More hours don't necessarily mean more productivity. Micromanagement and overworking your people can backfire and lead to less overall productivity.
