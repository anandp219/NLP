It didn't bother me too much  because he was helping me hit my numbers. However  during performance review time I was required to fill out the "biggest weaknesses & areas for improvement" section. Would I trade him coming to work every day on time  with him missing quota? Nope. I wanted him to be aware of it  and work on it when he could--- but not at the expense of hurting his strengths. When receiving feedback  and during that dreaded performance review  ask what you do best  and how you can more utilize and improve that strength.
