"They always pay their debts." Jeb  like Tommen  has money  advisors  and he seems like a decent guy. However  he doesn't have the charisma  or the necessary fire in his belly. Tyrion Lannister  says it best: He was a sweet boy  not like his brother. Bush has more money than anyone else  but he's spending it just as quickly  and he's not gaining ground. Donald Trump is making a play  and he appears strong  but ultimately has no plan to govern and will be defeated by the stronger Houses. Like House Baratheon's credo: "Ours Is The Fury" Trump is able to rouse passion  but the Fury needs to be tempered to win.
