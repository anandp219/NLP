Don't get impatient with people for being themselves. Similarly  don't promise what you can't deliver. It's really hard to go back on your word. And once you've promised something  it creates stress. The more you've promised and the more expectations on your shoulders  the more impatient you are likely to be. Say no more often and only commit to what you can really handle  and to what you want to do. You only have so much energy. Use it wisely. You are likely to feel impatient when you feel you have more to do  than time to do it.
