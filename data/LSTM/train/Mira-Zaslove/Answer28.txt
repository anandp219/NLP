  "The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge  but imagination." Albert EinsteinAlbert Einstein never took an IQ test  so we don't know his IQ. We can assume it was above average  but we can't say if it was 130  160  or 190. Furthermore  we don't know the IQ of all of his descendants  so it is hard to know for certain that they did not inherit his IQ. There is a lot of controversy about the heritability of IQ  but I'm not sure IQ matters much  especially in the case of Albert Einstein. Today the name Einstein is synonymous with genius.
