Sometimes it is just time to move on. Also  people talk. So if you've told anyone at the company  assume it may have already gotten back to your manager. That is ok. Just be careful what you say. Good rule of thumb: don't say anything to anyone at the company that you don't want getting back to your manager. Be straightforward  and keep your remarks short and sweet. You will probably need your current manager's recommendation for the new job  so be careful about being too honest about your reasons for leaving.
