  I've had this happen to me a few times in my life  and usually the person I kept seeing in my dreams  signified something larger in my life. The person you keep seeing in your dreams  may also represent something more in your life. Sometimes it can be as simple as dreaming about someone you think about during the day  but often the people you see in your dreams can also represent subconscious desires and thoughts. Psychologist Carl Jung believed that dreams acted as a window into the unconscious mind.
