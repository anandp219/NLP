  I can't believe I am writing this  but: Heidi Klum in Versace was the worst dressed at the 2015 Emmy's.I love Heidi. She is gorgeous  and she is usually very fashionable. She hosts and judges Project Runway  a fashion competition. Sometimes she wears looks from her designers  that can be a little out there. However  this look is from Versace  and it is a hot mess. Both from the front and back. It looks like a Big Bird inspired ice skating outfit. If someone made this on Project Runway  I would expect them to be voted off.
