Success and dream achievement have no age limit or expire-by-date. So whatever your dream  start now. Don't procrastinate or allow yourself to daydream about what you can achieve in the future. Start moving  and when you get tired  just think: Ruth Rothfarb ran the Boston Marathon -- A Race For The Ages -- at 86. 5. Don't give upYou need brutal determination. You cannot quit. You cannot surrender. Most people give up  when they are close to achieving their goal. No matter what the odds  no matter what happens  simply keep going.After all  as Baby Ruth reminds us: You just cant beat the person who wont give up.
