  So far  in 2015 more people have died from selfie mishaps than they have from shark attacks! This small fact is a reminder that people should focus more on their surroundings  and less on their phone. Especially if on a cliff  in the way of moving trains  driving a vehicle  or near dangerous animals. Safety first. Selfie second. Reported selfie-dealths are 12 so far this year. In this same period of time  there have been 8 deaths caused by sharks. (Source: More people have died from selfies than shark attacks this year)Taking selfies can be stupid and unflattering  yes.
