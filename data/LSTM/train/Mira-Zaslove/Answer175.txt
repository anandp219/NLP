  1. Shoot in good lighting More than anything else: seek out good lighting. Lighting matters more than anything else. Seriously. An awesome photographer with a professional camera will take a lousy photo if the lighting is bad.The best time to take a photo is around sunrise and sunset. Blue Hour  a short period of time direct before sunrise and after sunset  also produces great photos.If you are taking a photo of a person in the sun  make them step into the shade. Shadows are unflattering and will make your subject look like they bags under their eyes--never a flattering look.If you are indoors  stand near a window.
