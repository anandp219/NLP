Also  if you know anyone else at the company  and feel that they will give you a positive recommendation  let the interviewer know. Finally  if you are feeling uncomfortable and having a hard time reading what the interviewer wants  it's fair to ask them. For instance  say something along the lines of: "I have 10 years of work experience  and want to make sure I best answer your questions. Can you tell me what you would like me to focus on?"
