I felt like I was being dumped for the Prom Queen. And I was caught off guard. Not so much that the person wanted to leave  but how they chose to tell me. It didn't leave me with a good feeling. This person didn't get the new role  and honestly  in the back of my mind-- and during performance review time-- I always remembered their negative comments. Most managers don't like it when their team is being compared disfavorably to another team. Be gracious and let your current manager know how much you have appreciated their support and their help.
