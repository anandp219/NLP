In India  relationships and marriage are more of a family affair. The families in effect marry each other  and Parents have a lot of input into who and when their kids marry. Indian Parents also get involved and generally don't want their children dating or engaging in pre-marital relations. In fact  my Indian friend got into trouble because her fiance only hugged her in front of everybody at their ENGAGEMENT party. It would be unthinkable for them to make-out  like many American couples do -- at parties when they first meet each other.
