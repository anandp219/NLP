I've also found listening for when a story changes to be key.Top negotiators do their research. And they are often flexible -- seeing many ways to "win" in a situation. Whether this is their Best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) or just multiple ways to do a deal. They typically aren't overly rigid or too focused on changing somebodys mind. That is hard and exhausting. And it rarely works. Great negotiators focus on how they can get what they want and how they can give other people what they want.Also  to be a top negotiator you need to be authentic and believable.
