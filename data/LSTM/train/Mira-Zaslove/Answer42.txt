It isn't worth it for them.Get away as fast as you can. Don't try to fight. And absolutely do not get into their car. Stay in the open and run as fast as you can towards public places. It's much better for the thief to be suspicious  than for you to be robbed  or in danger. So if you think someone is a thief  run. Cancel your transaction mid-stream  if you have to  and get out of there. Even if your ATM card is in the machine. You can always call the bank to cancel the card  once you are in the clear.
