As a manager  a surprising amount of my time was spent dealing with co-workers who did not like each other for petty reasons. It's not a productive use of time or energy  especially if you loop in other people. So  be professional and if you must trash talk  do it with non-coworkers outside of work. However  if this person crosses the line  engages in harassing or abusive behavior  or is seriously impeding your ability to do your job  document the issues. Go to HR -- keep your personal dislike out of it  and focus on the behavior that is hurting the company.
