  The strangest thing I ever saw at airport security was at the Antonio Rivera Rodrguez Airport  in the Isla de Vieques  Puerto Rico. It was the first  and only time  I've ever seen a pet adoption at a security check point at the airport. The Vieques airport is tiny. It flies mostly small local airlines  offering flights to San Juan. The attitude at the airport is informal and friendly. And at airport security  there was an adorably friendly stray puppy running around. The puppy lived at the airport.
