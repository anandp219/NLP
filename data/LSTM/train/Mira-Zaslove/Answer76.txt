Being a woman  I was always underestimated and people never really saw me coming. You may find the same thing coming from a State School in Florida. People may not know how fierce you really are. Flying under the radar can be a good thing in highly competitive environments. Similarly  not having debt is a powerful and often under-appreciated thing. Without debt you will be able to take more chance and risks. Being shackled by debt is a scary and limiting. You may end up taking and staying at jobs you don't like simply to pay off debt.
