  Gold purity is measured in carats  so the difference between 10kt  14kt  18kt  and 22 kt refers to how pure the gold is. Higher carats = higher gold percentage  which is more more valuable. Higher carat gold also has a much more vivid yellow color. Higher carat gold is also a lot softer and less durable than lower carat gold. Subsequently  a cheaper  10k gold ring will be more durable  but less bright and lustrous  than a more valuable 22 carat gold ring. Gold is very soft-- it measures 2.5-3 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness.
