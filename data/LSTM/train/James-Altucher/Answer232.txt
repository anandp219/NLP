So its safe to say that this guy I was speaking to is the worlds greatest investor ever. He bought 100 shares. Never had to even think again. About anything. He couldve watched MTV and eaten nothing but Pringles for the next 35 years. And now hes got $18 000 000 in the bank. But he has big regrets. Because he sold those other 100 shares on only a double.Oh well. We have some work to do here. Because its not easy to find unusual things about Warren Buffett. But if you didnt notice the picture above  I wrote THE book on Warren Buffett.
