"I was speaking to Naveen Jain  who made his billions on an early search engine  InfoSpace. He just started a company to mine rare earth minerals on the Moon. But his real goal is extra-planetary colonization. Somehow we got around to the question of why have a company in the middle of that. He has billions. He can just go straight for the colonization part. He said  "Every idea has to be sustainable. Profitability is proof that an idea is sustainable." "You may think using Google's great  but I still think it's terrible."K.
