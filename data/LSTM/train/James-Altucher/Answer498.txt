  In the mid-90s I had an idea that lasted about the amount of time it takes to drink two beers. I say this because I had the idea at a bar and it was quickly squashed by the two friends I was with.I wanted to create a reality cable channel. All reality TV all the time. Reality TV was just beginning. MTVs The Real World and HBOs Taxicab Confessions were the only real two successful examples at that point. The day before  I had gone to a seminar at the Museum of Television and Radio about The Real World.
