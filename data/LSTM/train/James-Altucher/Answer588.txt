8) NO FOLLOW THROUGHI have a very good friend who is a brilliant brilliant scientist. Maybe the most brilliant man I know. I would tell him this to his face: you have no follow through. He has an idea. Everyone says its amazing! AMAZING! You are so SMART! He gets about 30% of it done. And then he is on to the next Brilliant idea. BRILLIANT! His kids live on food stamps. And every single one of his ideas is not just a million dollar idea. But a TRILLION dollar idea. Im not exaggerating. But he cant follow through.
