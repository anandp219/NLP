  When was the last time you felt like this little boy?Ive spent the past 20 years worrying about money. Worrying about what other people thought of me. Worrying about relationships  love  loss. Awkward about people  places  things  agendas Agendas. Thinking about the people who were angry at me. Obsessing on the people I was angry at. Scared to fail. Afraid to adventure. Thinking I had to achieve goals to alchemize unhappiness into happiness. Thinking I had to be the smartest person in the meeting  the room  the building  the city  thinking that the only way to I could ever be HAPPY was to get away far away far far away fromHEREjust so I could getTHEREin the land of the goals.
