All of the guests of my favorite season (but not Puck or Pedro  who was dead) were there answering questions. I felt reality TV was a cheap way to produce TV and people would get obsessed by it  particularly if sex was involved.What a dumb idea  a friend said. Theres only so much reality. Which strikes me as funny now.The other guy said  youre not a big TV company. How will you get the cable companies to go for the idea?So I never thought about it again. I put up a fence around the idea and decided I would not be able to leap over that fence to execute on the idea.
