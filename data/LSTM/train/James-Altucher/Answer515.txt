She had me do a breathing exercise that involved quickly exhaling but I forget the rest of it. Then I fell asleep.One investor of mine told me I had a scarcity complex  that I always had a strong feeling that I had nothing even when I had many things to be happy about.

But in this case maybe he was right.
