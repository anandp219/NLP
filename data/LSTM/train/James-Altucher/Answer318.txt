  My grandparents were disgusted with me when my first  second  and third girlfriends were Catholics.What do they cook? my grandmother asked.Cooking being the great differentiator in religion. She even said  Goulash? Like it was a curse.Many years later  after a lot of grief  I sat in St. Patricks in NYC  praying for money. please God  make my life better by giving me money.It didnt matter to me that it was a church. I was so scared I didnt know what to do.I would do anything  even pray to a god I didnt believe in  in a house of worship that I didnt feel welcome in  and asking for something that prayer was never intended for.Someone asked me yesterday.
