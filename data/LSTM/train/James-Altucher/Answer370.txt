Youll only get worse.If you insist the habit changes tomorrow  then the habit will certainly fail.Coolio  the rapper  wrote lyrics every day for 17 years before having a hit.Commander Hadfield  the astronaut  improved his skills every day for 20 years before getting into space.Kurt Vonnegut wrote every day for 25 years before he had a major bestseller.Even Mozart  despite being a prodigy  wrote music for 10 years every day before becoming a true master.Improve a little each day. It compounds. When 1% compounds every day  it doubles every 72 days  not every 100 days.
