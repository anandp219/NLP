  When I started a business  by definition  I knew nothing about business. I had just started! I was the worst. Here's what I knew. This was the 90s. I knew how to make a website. Nobody else knew. So American Express came to me and said  "Can you build a website?" That started my business. HBO came to me and said  "Can you build a website?" Miramax came to me and said  "Can you build a website?" I'm going to admit to you what I did not know: I did not know the business world values products (scalable) more than services (unscalable).
