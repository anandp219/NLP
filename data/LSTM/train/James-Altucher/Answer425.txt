Dont be afraid of new arenas.Again  inspiration is a risk. It means stepping out of the comfort zone where you've never been before. I try as an exercise to figure out at least one thing a day to do that is outside my comfort zone. One time I was talking to Noah Kagan and he suggested something simple: never time you go for coffee  ask for a 10% discount after they ring up your order. This sounds trite compared with planning a ship to Mars but it really made me nervous when I tried it. It was good practice.
