How many times do you think of a great idea and you think  this is so GREAT I will never forget it and then you forget it. It happened to me this morning. Claudia and I were talking last night and she said  You have to write this down! and I said  there is NO WAY Im going to forget this. Well  I forgot it. I pray to the gods of memory I will remember it but I forgot it. 10) THEY DONT LISTENI say  on average  10 000 words a day. I already know the things Im going to say. Meaning: they are already in my head.
