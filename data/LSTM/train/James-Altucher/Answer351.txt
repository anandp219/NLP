So probably the first thing is: I learned how to interrupt people. Afterwards  the guy who did the audio for the podcast said to me  "That was unbelievably inspiring." And then he quit his job. Wayne Dyer has worn many hats. He's been a therapist  a professor  a writer  a PBS fundraiser  to many a spiritual leader.I have no idea what he is. I think he wore many hats because in an interesting life  you do many interesting things. The dots don't always have to connect. To me he is the ultimate "Choose Yourself-er".
