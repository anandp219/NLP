  My eight year old daughter is crying right now. Shes trying to draw manga-style comic book figures. The eyes look stupid! she says  and the arms look flimsy! My oldest tries to calm her down  Mollie  Im three years older than you. Thats why my characters look so good  she says  but somehow that doesnt work and it doesnt help when my oldest says  Mollie  guess what  I finished drawing on the whole pad? Arent these pretty?I tell my youngest  Mollie  look on the Internet and see how other artists do their eyes and arms.
