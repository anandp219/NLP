When I visited Amazon last week I spent time with people in every department of publishing. They all spoke about Hugh's success but also about the successes of many authors now choosing the self-publishing route. Persistence is a magic power. Again: "If one reader liked my novels then it's worth it". He quit his full time job. He writes full time. I am sure Hugh's "I did" list is much greater than his "to-do" list.
