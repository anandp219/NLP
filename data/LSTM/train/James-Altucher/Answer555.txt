It was money in real life. If I tell you how I lost it you would hate me forever. Thats ok. But its not important for this.Failure is a word used to label a past event. Thats 100% up to you how you label a past event.When you label a past event failure it prevents you from moving beyond the past. You get stuck there. You keep time traveling to the moment of failure under the excuse that there is something to learn there.The thing you learn first is forgiveness. Forgive yourself. Then you move back to the present.
