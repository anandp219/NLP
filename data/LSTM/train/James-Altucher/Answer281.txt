Why did you get divorced. Why did you pick NYC? It's none of my business. But a kid doesn't care. A kid asks Why?The Whys add up.

To be honest  I want to write an episode for his TV show. Just for the fun of it. I have ideas for stories. It was my list of ten ideas each day this week. It was fun. But most of all  I want to hear all the things he's learning by doing his TV show.
