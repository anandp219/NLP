Every day  because I diversify my choices  I find freedom in everything I do. And I never do anything I don't want to do. What if I had to go to a bad job! Many people have to go to jobs they don't like. I will tell you a story. A friend of mine was an artist. We were walking in the rain. He pointed down and said  "what do you see?" I said  "a puddle." He said  "ok  look again". I looked down and I saw a puddle  and I saw people reflected in the puddle. And I saw the sky reflected in the puddle.
