It just so happens he later writes about dinosaurs  or people with tattoos  or whatever. He gets so passionate about a man with tattoos that he writes abut them. Occasionally I hear a ridiculous answer like "Strunk & White's" book. Who? Who are these people. And yes  grammar is important. But that's what editors are for. I love Anne Lamott's book "Bird by Bird". But some people hate it. Some people don't like how she describes writing. So it's not in the top three books about how to write. I can't read a book "How to be a great golfer" and get better at golf.
