Google is great. But it can be better. Having this mindset always forces you to push beyond the comfort zone. Once they changed the way typists viewed their skills (by recreating the feeling of "beginner's mind") the typists continued to get faster. We have a mantra: dont be evil  which is to do the best things we know how for our users  for our customers  for everyone. So I think if we were known for that  it would be a wonderful thing.Many people argue whether or not Google has succeeded at this.
