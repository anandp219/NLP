Mom and Dad bought a house  say in 1965  for $30 000. They sold it in 2005 for $1.5 million and retired.Thats a nice story. I like it. It didnt happen to my mom and dad. The exact opposite happened. Butfor some moms I hope it went like that.Maybe Mom and Dad had their troubles  their health issues  their marriage issues. Maybe they both loved someone else but they loved their home.Heres a fact: The average house has gone up 0.2% per year for the past century.Only in small periods have housing prices really jumped and usually right after  they would fall again.The best investor in the world  Warren Buffett  is not good enough to invest in real estate.
