  Jerry Seinfeld was asked by Howard Stern  why didnt you continue the series? After all  Seinfeld was being offered $100 000 000 by NBC if he agreed to just one more season.For Seinfeld everything boiled down to timing. He didnt have any special gimmicks in his act. So timing and writing was everything.In an interview with the LA Times he once said  A laugh is not just a laugh. It has different breadth  different pitch  different amplitude  and you learn to interpret what those things mean.Analyzing every detail like that is what made his comedy special.
