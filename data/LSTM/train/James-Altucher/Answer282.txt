And then I want to ask him about my own creative challenges. Friendships challenge each other. First we throw rocks at each other. But those rocks ignite the imagination of Jupiter and Saturn and time travel. Look at all of the arts and sciences: Steve Jobs started as friends with Steve Wozniak long before they made a dime. Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. Jackson Pollack and Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein and later Andy Warhol. The friendships that pushed each other to the next level. That pushed each other to compete and to play and to battle and to create.
