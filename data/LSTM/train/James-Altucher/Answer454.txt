No. Things cycle. But America has a tendency to overbuild. And then people overbuy. And then rentals are available.I always look at rentals. Right now there are better houses for less rent available within a mile of my house. But I like my landlord and house and I dont blow a good thing if I have it.I live right on the river and can watch the leaves turn green and in the summer there are giant parties in the park next to my house.And on Sunday nights they show movies outside next door and the whole town shows up.
