None of them made money. Not a single one.I remember one time sitting by the pool at a hotel in LA. That was fun. I drank and swam and drank and swam.In between  I had meetings that went nowhere. Then I went back to my company.How was LA.Great.One week wasted.- A little every dayI want to write a novel.I write a few paragraphs a day. I maybe tweak the outline every day. Guess what. If you write three paragraphs a day you'll write four novels a year.Three of them might be bad. Maybe ten of them will be bad.
