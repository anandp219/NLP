So I spent money on a penthouse apartment and bouhgt art and got a house in Atlantic City and started gambling after taking helicopters back and forth. So I put money in every investment possible just to impress people. And then I had $143 left and I was dead broke and blame myself for the deaths of at least two people. When you make money  keep it. Dont even invest it. Put it in the bank. Dont be greedy for more. You only need to get rich once. Unless you want to buy a basketball team you dont need to get rich twice.
