Yes. Yes I have. Maybe not some specific Lottery with a $100 000 000.00 prize but I have won many lotteries in life. Am I lucky in love. Yes. Yes I am. I am (thank you very much) on my second marriage. She is a very wonderful woman. Many people look at her and then look at me and say  "What the hell was she thinking?" My ex-wife is extraordinary also. She gave me two great kids. Sometimes they love me and sometimes they are very angry at me. But when they get angry I usually laugh at them (I'm just being honest).
