Heres a story about Buffett.Hes playing golf with a bunch of people and they all bet a dollar on a particular hole. Buffett wont bet. Why not  Warren? they ask him  youre worth a gazillion.He said  I never break my discipline.By contrast heres the house of his bridge partner Bill Gates:(a 9 building compound worth $150 mm)2) His worst investment ever I asked this question on Twitter earlier. I said  he lost his self-esteem and 20% in that order. Everyone came back with very smart responses: Conoco Phillips  where he lost $1 bb (but not 20% of his net worth (not even 2% of his net worth) and certainly not his self-esteem).
