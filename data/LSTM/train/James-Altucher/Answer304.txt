G) Don't Write from a Pedestal. Writers know that the world is a joke and nobody knows anything. When you write like you know something  like you're an expert  then you are making a fool of yourself. Many writers kill themselves because they've run out of things to joke about. They've run out of enough life to turn into insanity. Put yourself in the writing. Don't say "10 things to make life better". Say  "10 things I had to do to make life better or I would die." H) In good writing  people have no skills.
