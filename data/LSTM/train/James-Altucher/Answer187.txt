One of them I paid $2000 to develop and sold for $10 000 000 9 months later. (this is not bragging  I went dead broke about 2 years after that).Nine of the ten ideas were BAD. But you only need one.I) BUT IF IM COMING UP WITH BUSINESS IDEAS  HOW DO I KNOW IF IM ON THE RIGHT TRACK?Theres no way to know in advance if a business idea is a good one. For instance  Google started around 1996 but didnt make a dime of money until around 2001.Heres my favorite example. A company called Odeo was a software company to help people set up podcasts.
