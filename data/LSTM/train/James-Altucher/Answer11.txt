Wait  in each case  until you absolutely overwhelmed before you start hiring people. Once you hire someone there is a world of S**& that you have to deal with. Personalities  fights  politics  disagreements  gossip  etc. And  the most basic - they might do a bad job. A worse job than you would do because you are the OWNER and they are not. By the way  being overwhelmed is a good thing. It means you have revenues  profits  or users. Then you are allowed to hire people. The best business I've ever started is when there was only one other person besides me.
