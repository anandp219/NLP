In a sense  I was podcasting from January 1996 to January 1999. Four interviews released a week  chosen out of about 15 interviews a week. A little over 2000 interviews in all. 5% of that equals about 100 dominatrixes.And for 100% of them  I had to get my interviewees comfortable in 30 seconds or less. After 30 seconds they start throwing bottles at you. Or chasing you. Or even worse  just simply ignoring you.For my first few weeks of interviews  HBO made me bring a bodyguard. But when we were chased out of a transvestite club once he was at least three blocks ahead of me.
