It's almost ridiculous to me when a 16 year old gets angry. Am I lucky in business? I just had an investment fold on me that cost me $7 million. That doesn't seem so lucky. I've started 20 businesses and 17 of them failed. That doesn't seem so lucky.But I have yet to open the inside of this ticking clock we call the Universe. Who knows what was in store for me if those businesses haven't failed?Perhaps something would happen to my wife? Or I would get sick (something that has not happened to me in a very long time.
