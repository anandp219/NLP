I got her out of the party. And she kept laughing at me  "Your friends only like you because they think you have money. They're idiots and you're an idiot." And maybe she was right. But we broke up. She is now happily with someone else high up in the banking industry and I am happy for her. She is also running her own company. Very successful and a very good person. But not for me. I was very very unhappy. I got drunk every night. I kept asking myself  "am I crazy? Does nobody exist who has the simple qualities I want?"
