What if I splinter off pieces of myself  send it out to other galaxies and worlds and time zones and so on and give it eyes and ears and other senses. Then they would live  die  expand  create chaos  teach each other  betray each other  lie to each other  and against all odds  try to find hope in each other. Then when the piece of the Universe dies  as all things do  it will come back into the Universe  and the Universe will absorb all of the information  learning a tiny bit more about itself. This is the only religion.
