Anders Ericsson made famous the "10 000 hour rule" popularized later by Malcom Gladwell. The rule is: if you practice WITH INTENT for 10 000 hours then you will be world-class. He then wondered why typists would often reach a certain speed level and then never improve no matter how many hours. After doing research  its because they forgot the "With intent" part. They were satisfied with "good enough". You have to constantly come up with new metrics to measure yourself  to compete against yourself  to better the last plateau you reached.
