  This is one of those questions where I give "the rules" and then at the end of the post I can say "and the last rule is to break all of the rules". It's almost a rule of "rules" posts that you have to have that at the end. You know why? Because we are all individuals. We all get physically healthy in different ways  for instance. Take diets as an example. Every diet says "don't". Don't eat carbs. Or don't eat meat. Or don't eat calories after 6pm. Etc. But for every "don't" there is at least one large massively healthy society that ONLY eats that macronutrient and yet they are healthy and live to 100+  etc.
