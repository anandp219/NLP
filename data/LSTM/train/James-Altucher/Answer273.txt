Just doodles. Thousands of them. Charles Darwin found his passion playing with rocks halfway around the world. He played with them  he kicked them around  he drew pictures of the tree of life around those rocks  for EIGHT YEARS  before returning to the land of adults where he accomplished his life's work while all of the adults jeered in his path. Mozart found his passion when he finally escaped the adulthood of a steady job in Salzburg  for the virility of Vienna where commanding operas and orchestras and singers and actors he grated Don Giovanni  the opera that changed every piece of music that ever came after that.
