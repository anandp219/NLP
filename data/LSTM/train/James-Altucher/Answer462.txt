That place is huge. And I only need that one special color of paint.But where is it? The stormtroopers at Home Depot are never around when you need them.And what about that snake that can clean my toilet. Where is it? And how do I use it? And is it gross? Why do they call it a snake?Its no wonder that plumbing is one of the highest paid professions in America.And how long does it take to paint a house. Or who do I go to? And will they overcharge me if they pave the driveway?Did I calculate that into my total cost of owning a house?I like to sit in the garden area of Home Dept.
