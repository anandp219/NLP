Marie Curie found her passion  like so many of us  by again playing with rocks. Why did some rocks seem to be like the sun  their own source of light when all else around them was pitch black dark. Mick Jagger had no musical talent at all but would collect blues records from America and he and his childhood friend Keith Richards would lie around listening to them. When his parents sent him off to study at the London School of Economics  he was still listening to those records and doodling the notes rather than paying attention to supply versus demand.
