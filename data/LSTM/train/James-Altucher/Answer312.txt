I was forced to choose myself. I started to exercise every day. I started to eat better. One item for breakfast. A healthy lunch. Tiny dinner. No snacks. I started to sleep 9 hours a day. I started to only be around people who loved and supported me. I broke off all ties with anyone who I felt bad to be around. I wrote down ideas every day of articles I could write and about businesses I could start. Bit by bit I started to get paid to write. If you dont exercise the idea muscle it atrophies. I decided I wanted to help people every day and be honest every day.
