That's integrity. Nobody has ever given me my money back. You give advice and help people when you sincerely want them to do better. Do this every day. It adds up. No  it doesn't add up. It multiplies. It compounds. Theres negative integrity and positive integrity. Negative integrity is saying to your boss: I failed because I missed the train. Positive integrity is  I like your idea for A  B  C reasons but how about you give a chance to X  Y  and Z and I bet we can make your idea a huge success to your boss.
