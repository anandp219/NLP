This could be the entire reasons for the income difference but the studies need mention that. Here's a study: take everyone who got accepted to Harvard. Tell half of them you can't go to college ever. Instead  get your four year head start on making money. Then see who has more money 20 years later. 6) ITS NOT A SAFETY NETI ask my kids: why do you think it's good to go to college. Despite my insistence (maybe because of it) they still think it's a good idea to go to college. They both say the same thing  "it's a safety net so you can get a job".
