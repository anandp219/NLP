Small Hershey chocolates  like you hand out on Halloween. At around 8am I stood outside the entrance of the New York Stock Exchange and started handing out chocolates to everyone walking inside. People would be staring at their feet like zombies as they walked in  but 100% of the time  they would stop  look up  take the chocolate  and they would smile. Chocolate releases phenylephylamine   the same hormone that is released when you fall in love. Suddenly  for a brief moment  everyone in the stock exchange was a little closer to falling in love.
