I had never even been aware of money before. My prior goals had been playing games  making fun websites  or writing novels. Then my only goal was money  money  money  and more money. I told my therapist at the time  in 2001  its like losing a loved one and she said  sweetie  sounds like youve never really lost a loved one before.Money is a great thing. Its the payoff on hard work  great luck (which is often earned luck) and you can do amazing things with it. Build new businesses  create jobs  buy your independence and freedom from corporate America.
