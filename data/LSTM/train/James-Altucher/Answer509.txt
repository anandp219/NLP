The purpose is to have 1000s of ideas over time. To develop the idea muscle and turn it into a machine.Here are some FAQ's about becoming an idea machine:A) Do you have a theme each day for your ideas?Yes. As a simple example it might be 10 businesses I can start? Or 10 books I can write or 10 chapters I can write for a book on quality parenting (which would obviously be a fiction book).A theme is like a target  and knowing that you can come up with 10 decent ideas gets you closer and closer to hitting the bullseye on the target.B) What if I cant come up with 10 ideas?Heres the key: the first three ideas are always easy.
