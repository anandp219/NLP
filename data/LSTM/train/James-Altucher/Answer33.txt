I introduced him to a successful guy I knew on Wall Street. I couldnt even find the guys office. I had never been down as south as Wall Street. My friend and I sat there while Shlomo (not his real name  but you get the drift) said  look at me! Ten years ago I was a shlub. Now I have 100 million dollars. Only in America  right? About two years later Shlomo was in the center of a massive FBI sting involving a currency brokerage he had started that had been simply pocketing investors money since the 70s.
