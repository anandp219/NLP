You can be a decent writer before then. You can be a paid writer before then. But every writer I've ever interviewed (and I've interviewed many on my podcast and elsewhere) always seem to come down to that number. Kurt Vonnegut is a classic example. Started writing in 1945 when he returned from the war. Didn't really have financial success with writing until about 1970 and in 1968 all of his books were out of print. So he kept going. Persistence  even more than rewriting  separates out the good writers from the bad writers.
