Trust me on this. I've seen a thousand businesses. You will have a good one if you follow the above ideas (or I should say  avoid the above mistakes). Oh  one more. J) HAVE SEX WITH EMPLOYEESThis is a really bad idea. Employees are there to help you get customers  deliver to customers  follow up with customers  and handle the running of your business.
