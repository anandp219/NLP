Financial wealth is a side effect of the runners high of your idea muscle.Whoah! That was a big intro. Depending on where I post this  some people will write tl;dr which I had to look up and it means too long  didnt read. I encourage those people to stop reading here and save yourself the trouble. Its ok. Im not mad at you. Ill write smaller articles also. Ill even draw cartoons.Ive often written about the idea muscle as part of what I call my daily practice. Every day I have to check the box on physical  emotional  mental  and spiritual health.And I get a lot of questions about it so I will try and answer them here.
