I think of this when people tell me they are a good judge of character. Almost everyone says they are a good judge of character. How can everyone be above average at this critical skill for life survival? At least half people must be below average. Similarly  in polls  9 out 10 people think they are above average drivers. So clearly  self-delusion is good protection against mediocrity. Maybe the second step of self-awareness is to simply stop paying attention to that voice that is judging you. But it never seems to stop.
