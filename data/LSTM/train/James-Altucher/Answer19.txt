Other employees might get upset. And once one employee gets upset  that "upset-ness" spreads like a disease. Whenever an employee gossips badly about you  you have to fire them or the disease spreads. This is what starts to happen once you start having sex with employees. I've seen great startups totally blow it because of this. Don't do it. -----There's a lot of other things that can go wrong  but this is the top. For instance  did you know its important to have a great relationship with your landlord?How come?
