"Quiet" by Susan CainProbably half the world is introverts. Maybe more. It's not an easy life to live. You feel as if you can't move  you can't talk  you can't go into a room and spread a vision you might have. Quiet shows the reader how to unlock the secret powers that probably half the world needs to unlock. "Antifragile" by Nassim TalebAnd throw in "The Black Swan" and "Fooled by Randomness". "Fragile" means if you hit something might break. "Resilient" means if you hit something  it will stay the same.
