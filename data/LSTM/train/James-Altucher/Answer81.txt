  Martin Luther King nominated Thich Nhat Hanh for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1967 and hes a buddhist monk and peace activist.And when he was standing right in front of me tonight I was blown away by what he said.We went to an opening for an exhibit of his calligraphy.He looked like a child. He smiled like a child. He talked like a little boy. It was almost funny to look at.Heres some things he either said or drew that I learned from.How to Do What You Love.He starts his day with tea  he said. And he loves calligraphy.
