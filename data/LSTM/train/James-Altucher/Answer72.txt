My little story on this: A company called Oingo came calling one of my partners one day in 2000 or 2001. I forget which year  thats how little impact it made on me. They were working on some algorithm for matching ads with web pages on search engines  or something like that. They needed funding badly. We almost couldve named our price. I said  because I was the resident genius  No way. Isnt the entire search engine business dead? Somehow they survived  changed their name to Applied Semantics and were bought by a tiny search engine company with no revenues called Google.
