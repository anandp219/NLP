In the land of the motivations. In the land of success. "What a waste.Now I hear the birds chirping  its not yet 5am. If I can picture it for a second  being a young boy  smiling  I have my bread. Picture what is in the eyes of that boy. Picture those are your eyes. Feel that moment of flight through the air  society hasnt yet given me my orders  my goals. Im free to run  to enjoy  to relax. Yesterday is long gone. Tomorrow will never come. Im happy today  with my bread  with my smile  with both feet flying in the air.
