E) DON'T COMMUNICATEHere's the magic rule: talk to a new customer every day for 100 days. It doesn't matter what you talk about. Just call them and say  "how's it going?" Some customers might look at this and say  "I don't want to hear from my vendor for 100 days in a rule." They are lying. They do. And they don't know it. This is often called  "following up". As soon as you meet a potential customer  have an entire system in place to follow up. As soon as you deliver a proposal  follow up  as soon as you deliver a product  follow up.
