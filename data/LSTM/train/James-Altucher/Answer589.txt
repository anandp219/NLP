The next idea is always bigger. Thomas Edison didnt say  I did it! when he made the light bulb. He called up the mayor of New York and worked out a deal to light up downtown New York City. The first city in history to be lit up at night by electricity. He got paid for that. He made a company. He followed through. He got rich. That's the difference between Edison and Tesla  who was probably smarter in every way than Edison but died penniless. If you have trouble following through  delegate. But dont forget the other rules above: Over deliver.
