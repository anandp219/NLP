I then write down in my notepad what question I might want to ask based on that highlight.Most of the time I highlight something because I learned something incredible from it  hence the very reason the person is on my podcast - because I wanted to learn from them and they are heroes of mine.In one case this week I had to track down a book released in the UK but not yet released until next month in the US.In another case  the person I was interviewing didn't have a book out but I read through all the articles he was involved in and the media strategy he had helped set up for his company.I also watch every interview the person has ever done.This is critical because I want to make sure I don't repeat any questions they are already bored of answering.
