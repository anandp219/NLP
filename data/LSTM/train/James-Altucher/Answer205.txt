This guarantees you will only come up with bad ideas. Because you will hoard your ideas. You will develop a SCARCITY COMPLEX around your ideas.Ideas are infinite. But once you define your capacity of good ideas (half) then they instantly become finite for you. Not for anyone else. But just for you  your ideas will be finite.If you stick to an abundance mentality  and be grateful for the ideas that are flowing through you  then they will be infinite. Where they come from  nobody knows. But they will be infinite and lucrative for you.So give ideas for free  and then when you meet  give more ideas.
