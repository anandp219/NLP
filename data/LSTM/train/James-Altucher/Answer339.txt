I documented on Twitter before I started handing out and when I was done.It's not bragging if it's true.BUT  I can't take all the credit.People blame the 2009 crash on the housing crash. This is not true.Housing prices peaked in 2006. The housing crash was only one small piece of the puzzle in the 2009 crash.I won't get into all the details of how banks account for mortgage debt.But basically  the FASB (financial accounting services board) changed the rules mid-flight on how banks should account for their debt.
