  I've interviewed at least 100 dominatrixes. Which makes me an expert on something but I'm not sure what.The math I use to get there is straightforward. The first time I had to do an interview it was for my HBO web series "3AM" 18 years ago. The idea was this: if you were out on a Tuesday night at 3 in the morning  I was going to find you and interview you.Why Tuesday? Because Saturday is too obvious (you were enjoying a night out on the town). And Tuesday  well  let's just say you were up to something.
