The next two are a little harder  and for me  I find that ideas 5-10 make my brain literally sweat. It almost hurts.Ideas  art  business  life is all about connecting the dots of one area of your life with the dots in other areas of your life.Doing this directly translates into biologically building up the neural pathways between collections of neurons in your brain.This is what changes you from becoming a person with the occasional idea  to a creative person  to an idea machine. You become the one-eyed king in the land of the blind.D) My idea muscle has atrophied.
