The reason I did not know this is because services are profitable (You can always fire people when business is slow) Here's also what I did not know: how to hire people and fire people. Or how to manage people. I didn't know anything. Business is like "micro-economics". Supply and demand  etc. Macro-economics is like: what happens if there's a draught and we grow less corn. What happens? So here's what I don't know now: I don't know how to really read a "P&L" sheet. Just tell me your revenues and profits and let me ask some questions and I can figure out what's working and what's not.
