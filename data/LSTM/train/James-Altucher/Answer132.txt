And so on. Johnson is a thinker and a linker and tells a good story. "Man's Search for Meaning" by Victor FranklI'm at a loss for words here. Just read it. Don't read it for the holocaust. Or psychological theory. Read it because when you're about halfway through you will realize your life is no longer the same. "Born Standing Up" by Steve MartinAnd while you are at it  throw in "Bounce" by Mathew Syed  who was the UK Ping Pong champion when he was younger. I love any book where someone took their passion  documented it  and shared it with us.
