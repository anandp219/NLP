  I wrote the worst book ever when the world was crashing and more people than ever before in history were committing suicide. Specifically  December 2008  banks were shutting down  the stock market had it's worst fall ever in history  everyone was losing jobs  homes  families. That month I published a book on investing. It sold 291 copies. It was the worst timing on the worst book in the worst period in recent history. I also lost my house and my wife. So one time my kids were visiting me. I made them come up with me from bookstore to bookstore.
