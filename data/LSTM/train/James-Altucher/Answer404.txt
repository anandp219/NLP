HERE. HAVE FUN WITH IT: (from Choose Yourself  middle of the book). Have you ever wondered why the stock market didnt just keep going down? Why it bounced at all from March 2009 until the day I am writing this  when the market is hitting all-time highs? Very simple--and I state this with all humility--I personally saved the US stock market. I moved to Wall Street in early March of 2009. Specifically  the corner of Broad and Wall in the building that was once JP Morgans bank. You may recall from your history books that the building was the site of the first major terrorist attack on the United States.
