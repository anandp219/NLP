)G) HOW DO I KNOW IF AN IDEA IS A GOOD IDEA?You wont. You dont. You cant. You shouldnt.Lets say you come up with ten ideas a day. In a year you will have come up with 3650 ideas (no breaks on weekends by the way if you want to get good at this). Maybe more if you are trying to do 20 ideas a day.Its unlikely that you came up with 3 650 good ideas (after you become an idea machine your ratio goes up but probably in the beginning your ratio of bad ideas to good is around 1000:1).Dont put pressure on yourself to come up with good ideas.
