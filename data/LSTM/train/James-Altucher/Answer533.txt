G) Are You Fully Charged? This book will make you a better person  leader  businessman. At least...it did for me. Plus I have a man-crush on Tom Rath. H) Sapiens by Blah Blah Blah. I hate always looking up his name. My wife and I always just call him  "Israeli guy". This book is the most important economics book ever. If there were such a thing as economics. Who cares. Read it. The 80 000 year overview of where we've been and where we are going. At the very least you will be smart at cocktail parties after you read this book.
