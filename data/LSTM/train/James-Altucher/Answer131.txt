Basically: don't believe the myth of the lonely genius. Ideas come from a confluence of history  "the adjacent possible" specific geographic locations  etc. The connections Johnson makes are brilliant. For instance  The Gutenberg Press (which  in itself  was invented because of improvements in sewing looms)  made everyone realize they had bad vision. So the science of lenses was created. So microscopes were eventually created. So germs were eventually discovered. So modern medical science was discovered.
