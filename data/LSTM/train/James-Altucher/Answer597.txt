My first ten books were done unprofessionally. Even the ones with the big publishing houses. They will probably hate me now. I hope not. I really like the people I worked with at these publishers.I hope that everyone self-publishes. The benefits are enormous:A) more money.Unless you are a John Grisham or EL James you will make much more money by PROFESSIONALLY self-publishing. Its not just money on sales but also foreign rights and special packages that you can offer if you control all the rights to your work.
