But many people who are failures think that once they make it  the job is over. I thought my job was over when I had millions in the bank. So I stopped being healthy. So I stopped being nice to the people around me. So I spent money on a penthouse apartment and buoght art and got a house in Atlantic City and started gambling after taking helicopters back and forth. So I put money in every investment possible just to impress people. And then I had $143 left and I was dead broke and blame myself for the deaths of at least two people.
