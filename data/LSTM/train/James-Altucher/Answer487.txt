18. Be grateful.Blah. This is a boring one but it actually works very well. The other day I was very upset about something. Claudia and I were in an argument. It's hard to be married for long periods of time without being in an argument. Maybe Jesus can do it. But I can't. And when I'm in an argument with Claudia  it's the worst thing in the world. I feel all closed up. Like I can't breathe. So it was hard to feel grateful but I still tried. Maybe that helped get me out of my cave. Bit by bit I found myself more grateful for things.
