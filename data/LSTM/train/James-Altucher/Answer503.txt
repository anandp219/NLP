Im assuming he made a similar call to Airbus and took the best deal.He then probably found out what it cost to lease space in the various airports he would need to use. They were probably happy with more business. And then  Im guessing  he hired some pilots  some ground crew  and put an ad in the paper advertising his new air routes and he was in business.Virgin Air is successful (I just flew it from NY to LA a few weeks ago) and has since spun off Virgin Galactic. So this scruffy kid who started a record label is now sending rocketships into space.Note the important thing: the day he came up with the idea he also called Boeing and got a plane from them.
