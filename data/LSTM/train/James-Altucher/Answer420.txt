These are all things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago.And now imagine what it will be like 300 years from now when people look back at today.

My biggest mistake is probably weighing too much on someones talent and not someones personality. I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.I recently watched a company go from a billion in revenues to zero when a founder stole $90 million from the company.
