At least  from my experience it will be harder. Its like taking out the garbage and expecting to meet the love of your life in the garbage can.My life is like a laboratory and happiness has been the experiment. Only when Ive been in the 1% of happiness have my other goals been satisfactorily achieved.So I know what I have to do when I slip into the 99%. This might not work for everyone. Maybe some people have to protest with signs to be in the top 1% of happiness. That doesnt work for me.But these ten things work for me:A) Lately  exercise has worked for me to stay in shape and sweat out toxins.
