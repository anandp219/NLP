As his daughter  Susan  says: Unconventional is not a bad thing. More people should have unconventional marriages.But  one thing struck me as interesting. The annual meeting is about eight hours long. I dont recommend it to anyone. I cant remember anything he said except one thing. Actually I remember something Charlie Munger (Buffetts number two) said. Something to the effect that long-term you better bury all your guns and valuables in the backyard and at that point Buffett shut him up.But one thing Buffett said always stuck with me.
