  I met a girl in a bar. Which is the first and only time I had ever done that. She said  "try this". It was a drink. I tried it. We ordered two more. Then two more. Then two more. then two more .I went to the urine-stenched bathroom. I came back. She was kissing another guy. I was dizzy. I was blurry. I said  "hey!" She said  "he was just being friendly". Two more. The bartender was laughing at my jokes. He googled me and gave me free drinks. Two more. He said he would buy my book. He watched a video of me.
