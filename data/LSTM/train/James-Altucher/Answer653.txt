We made it to my hotel room. I forgot my room number. I forgot how to use the key. I forgot I was with the girl. I went to my room and she collapsed in the living room. I fell asleep. About an hour later I woke up and was feeling sick. I ran into the bathroom and along the way I projectile vomited along the walls  the bed  the bathroom  the floor. When I was finished I fell asleep back down on the bed  which had my vomit. A few hours later I had to wake up. I got dressed. I put on a tie. I saw the girl in the living room.
