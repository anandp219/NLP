"Wayne Dyer is like a hero to me " he said and I was curious why. "Think of it this way: he's done 10 specials raising money for PBS. He's raised over $150 million for PBS." That is impressive  I said. "Yes  but that's not the point. PBS runs those pledge shows over and over. And PBS has higher ratings than all of the broadcast channels combined.Think about how much airtime and free advertising Wayne Dyer got for himself by doing those shows." I don't think that's why Dyer did those shows but it's interesting the perspective.
