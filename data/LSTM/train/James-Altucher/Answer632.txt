Everyone is so witty and challenging and I just sit there. I have made a habit out of mediocrity. There's the saying  "stand next to the smartest person in the room". The flip side of that is to make sure you're never the smartest person in the room. I also don't want to be the best at whatever I do. I'd rather steal from the best. Then I have more confidence I'm doing the right thing. Anyway  I'm mediocre and proud. And I use it to my advantage to occasionally get good stuff done. If I ever find myself above-average again I'm very fortunate that at the very least I have my inner voice.
