And when I say "Instant" I mean: about a million dollars a week I lost for 15 weeks in a row. I would cry at night. I couldn't get out of be. My ex-wife would offer to make pancakes and I would actually refuse (pancakes being wildly known as the secret recipe the aliens left us before they took off for distant galaxies). And then I was dead broke and lost my house and eventually my ex-wife and then my self-respect and all my friends and on and on. All because I wished for something. Nobody is entitled to anything.
