He answers emails. He has to deal with the business now of being a writer. He came on my podcast. He writes a blog. He analyzes data about self-publishing versus traditional publishing. He approves covers and goes over his royalties I am assuming. But every day he writes. Pick your one thing. Do it. Share it if you can. And at the end of the day or week  write your "I Did" list. Life doesn't have to die in the cubicle. Weave magic out of the hidden silences in between meetings. Create your one thing a day.
