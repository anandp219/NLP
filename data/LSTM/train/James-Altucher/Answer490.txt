I judge less. I treat them with honesty and I am more open to them. This one thing has changed my life. When I'm walking in the street  though  I have to be careful not to smile at too many young boys. 21. HonestyNot radical honesty  which is bullshit. Just because you want to have sex with your girlfriend's sister doesn't mean you have to broadcast it everywhere. Just: if you say something  then it's either true to you  or you live up to what you say. This maybe is the most important habit. Honesty defines your character.
