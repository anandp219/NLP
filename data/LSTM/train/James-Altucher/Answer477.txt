I used to get my news from newspapers. I'd read 3-4 newspapers a day and then read online. That would take about two hours of life each day. Now I scan down what's trending on twitter. Takes me about two seconds. People always say  "no news is good news". Now....I always have no news. So it's always good news Some people have gotten angry at me over this. Like  "how can you change the world if you are so uninformed. "To them I say  "Blah!" And it doesn't matter. I'd rather read a book then read about 9 children being killed in Kazakhstan.
