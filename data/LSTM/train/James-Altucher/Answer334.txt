Don't buy it. I don't care.I just want to tell people how much BS the news vomits every day and how it's effected the markets.Instead of the 20 reasons I wrote this month  let me give the 3 or 4 most important (all 20 took up 5000 words  with another 5000 words on angel investing).A) CHINAChina growth is slowing. So the Wall Street Journal  which I used to write for  is saying "Chinese economy reeling".Oh my god. Please please please. Stop that.China is GROWING. It used to grow 10% per year because it was communism and 2 billion people were farmers.Now it's "going down" to 7% growth.Horrors!
