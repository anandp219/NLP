Knock on wood). I don't have a billion dollars. Or even one hundred million. I used to think I would only be happy if I had one hundred million dollars. I once had a company I started that was all set to go public. The banks that were taking me public said I could be worth up to $900 million if we went public. Unfortunately  they didn't take us public. Bad things happened. I was fired as CEO. Then fired from the board. Then I lost all my shares. A few years ago it was bought and I made nothing. BUT...if it had gone public...I had it all planned out.
