At reaching you. E) LAUGHTERLaughter is before language. It's primal communication. If there was a rustling in the bush: could it be a lion? Or is it just the wind?Once a mammal discovered it was just the wind  an instinctive laugh would come out  informing the other members of it's tribe that there is nothing to worry about. Danger transforming into relief is communicated via laughter. This is true for at least the last 2 million years. Everyone is in danger constantly. How many people around the world woke up at three in the morning today  scared of something that will probably never happen.
