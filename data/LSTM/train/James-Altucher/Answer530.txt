You can't learn that from a teacher. You can learn a tiny bit from books. What do you do if economics is BS and you are answering a question about "What are the 10 best Economics books?" I don't want to lie to you. I'm going to give you the 10 best books that inspired me to make more money. That's  pure and simple  what I hear when I hear the world "economics". These books won't make you more money. But they will inspire you and point you in the right directions for making money. I'm not going to give you books I read in college.
