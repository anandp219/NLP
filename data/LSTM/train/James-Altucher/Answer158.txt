XOM (Exxon). With the US about to become the next Saudi Arabia  Im always looking for the leader to buy. XOM yields 2.7% and has raised its dividend for 32 years in a row. Its pretty likely this company will be here 20 years from now. GSK (Glaxo SmithKline). People are getting old. Old people need medicine. GSK pays a 4.7% dividend and has raised it at least 10 years in a row. CBI (Chicago Bridge & Iron). What an odd name for a company based in the Hague that builds power plants but the reality is: if we need more energy  which we do  we need someone to build the power plants.
