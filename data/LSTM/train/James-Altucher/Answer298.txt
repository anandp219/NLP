  I write for about five to ten hours a day. And another hour a day at least in pain trying to figure out what I'm going to write about. I got thrown out of graduate school because I spent all my time writing novels that never got published. I failed five classes in a row and eventually they asked me to leave. Finally  13 years after that  I got my first paycheck for writing something. I got a $200 check. I framed it. 13 years later  about a few months ago  I threw the check in the garbage. I don't like to feel sentimental over anything.
