Packages that the traditional publishers almost never go for.B) control over design. Traditional publishers usually keep that control.C) speed. You will probably speed up your publication date by over a year or more if you self-publish.D) content control. My bet is close to 100% of the people reading this post have content in them strong enough for a book. But 22 year old interns at publishing companies wont recognize that content. Even the editors  the publishers  the marketing guys  most of them  will not recognize the message you have to offer.
