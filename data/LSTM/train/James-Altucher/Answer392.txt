Be the source. 6) LACK OF INTEGRITYI dont mean be honest. Thats obvious. How do you take honesty and integrity to the next level? You become vulnerable. You admit mistakes before you have to. You offer people their money back when you've lost it and didnt have to. I was talking to Ev Williams who started Twitter. When his older company  Odeo  wasn't working out - he and his board decided to give everyone their money back before moving on. That's integrity. Nobody has ever given me my money back.
