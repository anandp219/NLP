BS economics writers.Less than 1% of our Gross National Product is sales is to China.So even if CHINA DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY the US would still have a growing economy.Oh  did I mention China is not disappearing. It's GROWING. At a faster rate than the United States.B) INTEREST RATES MIGHT RISEAre you kidding me?Let me explain simply please.The Fed lends money to banks.
