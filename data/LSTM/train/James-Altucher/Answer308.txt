We built websites for entertainment companies. Bad Boy Records  Miramax  Time Warner  HBO  Sony  Disney  Loud Records  Interscope  on and on. Oh  and Con Edison.Mobb Deep would hang out in my office. Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails would stop by. RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan would want to play chess. We even made a website for a brothel in Nevada.Then I saw that kids in junior high school were learning HTML. So I sold the business.I bought an apartment for millions. I rebuilt it. Feng Shui! I bought art.
