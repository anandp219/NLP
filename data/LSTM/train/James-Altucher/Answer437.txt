You can do whatever you want in those silences. What if I have to take care of kids when I'm outside my job? Same thing.I'm not going to give the BS line: "children are our greatest teachers". They aren't really. They are mostly annoying. They are hard work. The best thing a kid teaches us is patience and how to avoid these new  very enticing kinds of anger and annoyance. I had nothing extra on my "to do" list this past week. But when I look back at my "I did" list I'm very proud. If I had to pick one thing I'd want to share it would be to check out my podcast with Hugh Howey.
