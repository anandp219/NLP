Three of the best investors in history: Howard Hughes  Carl Icahn  and Warren Buffett have crashed and burned buying airlines. Warren Buffett once said something like that the best way to end up with a billion is to start with two and buy an airline. And yet Branson came up with the idea and that very day he called up Boeing to find out what it would cost to lease an airplane. He made a great deal with them that if it didnt work out he could return the airplane. Else if it did work out  hed be a great customer for them.
