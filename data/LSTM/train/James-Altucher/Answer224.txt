It's a novel and none of the chapters are really connected. It's basically a book by an insane man who later killed himself. And that's writing. Also good by him: Cockpit. 11) Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl (but only part 1 - not the theory part). His entire "meaning" that helped him survive the concentration camps was writing this book. And you feel it. 12) How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World by Harry Browne. I don't always agree with him (and I hate when people say that) but the philosophy has largely become a part of my writing.
