"Getting worse" is powerful feedback. LUCKY PEOPLE are grateful for bad results. Because they use that feedback to get better at the things they love. - RELATIONSHIPS My second wife loves me I think. And if she didn't that would be okay also. I'm trying to get better at separating out results from love. I love her  so if she wanted to be somewhere else  I would love that about her. Then I will always be lucky in love. I am one of the ugliest people on the planet. And yet  because I practice good loving  then it's easy for me to be happy with all the relationships around me.
