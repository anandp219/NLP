  Its Financial Suicide To Own A HouseI am sick of me writing about this. Do you ever get sick of yourself? I am sick of me.But every day I see more propaganda about the American Dream of owning the home.I see codewords a $15 trillion dollar industry uses to hypnotize its religious adherents to BELIEVE.Lay down your money  your hard work  your lives and loves and debt  and BELIEVE!But I will qualify: if s1omeone wants to own a home  own one. There should never be a judgment. Im the last to judge.
