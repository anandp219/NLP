  I once went to a Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. I met a guy who told me how in 1976 he bought 200 shares.After a year the stock had doubled so I decided to take some profits off the table. I sold 100 shares and started a restaurant and ran that for the next 30 years  he said. Made a decent living." "The other 100 shares I did nothing with at all. Now its worth over $12 million." I admit it. I was jealous. I wanted to be him. After that I got ahold of Warren Buffetts letters. Not his Berkshire letters  which were available to the public.
