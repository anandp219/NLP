It's all practice. It's all about 1% improvement every day. How do I know there aren't people luckier than me in the world? I don't know. Maybe there are. But I doubt it. Because we're in a giant video game that I created. I put myself in here to play a character. I'm the only person alive. So that makes me the luckiest person alive. Smile! Flash!
