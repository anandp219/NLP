Since I do a podcast now this seems like a great idea to me. So they raised a ton of money from professional venture capitalists.Then one of their programmers started working on a side project. The side project got a little traction but not much. But the CEO of Odeo decided to switch strategies and go full force into the side project without having a clue if it would work.He felt bad since this isnt what the investors invested in. So he called up all of the investors  some of the best investors on the planet  and described the side project to them and all the traction they were getting  etc and then made an offer  Since this is a different direction  Id be willing to buy all of your shares back so nobody will lose any money.100% of his investors said  YES!
