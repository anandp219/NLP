At least 5 introductions a day. I got involved in a mental health company I sold for $41 million. I started a website  Stockpickr! which got millions of unique users. I found advertising for it. I sold it to The Street. I had made millions again from scratch.Then I stopped using the fundamental techniques I described above. Every time Ive lost money its because I squandered my physical  emotional  mental  and spiritual health.I was really bad. I did everything you should not do. I was like an addict.
