No judgement!I was really scared the first time. And the second time. And the 100th time. And 18 years later during podcasts I'm still nervous every time I'm about to interview someone.But for those 3am shows I would pretend I was an actor and that I knew the people and I would just go up to them and say  "Hey  how's it going? "I wore my HBO jacket and there were video people behind me so the subjects would get a little bit shocked and then I would explain what I was doing.The key was this: within the first 15-30 seconds I had to get them so comfortable that they had to be able to tell me their deepest secrets.People were cheating on their spouses (both men and women)  people were looking for drugs  or were teenagers scared of their parents and police  or were simply completely insane.
