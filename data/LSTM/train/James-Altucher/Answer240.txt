In the next profile after Buffett   Smith wrote about a guy who was sitting in a Swiss jail. If you screw up a bank in Switzerland you are going to jail  no get-out-of-jail free cards. What was this guy doing while in jail? Trying to write some fiction. Thats where the profile ends. Paul Erdman went on to become the bestselling finance thriller writer ever. I highly recommend his novels.In any case  its a great chance to see how someone described Buffett before he became BUFFETT. I mentioned this to Pamela van Giessen at Wiley and she ended up republishing the book as a Wiley Investment Classic.
