They have bought and sold three houses and made money on each of them.I believe them. Perhaps many people are phenomenal investors.Others live in a good  secure neighborhoods that they want their kids to grow up in.I believe those people also. But Ive also seen the pain theyve gone through when jobs were not as stable as they thought or marriages are not as stable as they thought and that mortgage wouldve been nice in their hands instead of in the banks hands.We need a little bit of breathing room in order to survive when the noose is put around our neck.WHAT DO I DO THEN?You can rent.
