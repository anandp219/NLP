"The guy was in a LABORATORY. He experimented. And now everyone gets into failure porn and says "I'm a failure". Thats BS!John Coltrane didnt fail when he couldnt stay in Miles Davis quartet.He was experimenting with Miles Davis style but ultimately  with 20 years of practice and study under his belt  he knew that only his unique style could survive and flourish in his own quartet.He experimented  learned from the experiment and moved on.HERE is the key on experimenting:THE MORE MISTAKES YOU MAKE THE BETTER YOU GET.Why is this?
