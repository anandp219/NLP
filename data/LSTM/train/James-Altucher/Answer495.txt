For instance  if I have a plate of fruits  vegetables  and a cookie or two - net-net that is pretty good for me even if the cookies are not so good. Mmmm  I love cookies. The key is  if it's good in general not to judge people  then it's probably good to not judge yourself too harshly either 39. Failure = Experiment. People think "failure is good". Sometimes I even say that. Failure is not good. Failure is the worst. Failure is the mother and father of more failure. Thomas Edison did not fail 10 000 times to make one lightbulb.
