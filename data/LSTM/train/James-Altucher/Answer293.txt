?Requirements are bad. I require that the world give me a lot of money  that the world make my kids put their phones away at dinner  that whoever I am with loves me forever  without doubts. I require that people who have long ago stopped talking to me just relax and start talking to me again. Requirements are for people who want to be unhappy. Because its your rules or the universes rules. The universe is going to win. Every time.And yetIm sorry Im about to do the list. I dont really like it when people tell me the list of things they KNOW.Because nobody really knows anything.
