I spoke to Mark Messick recently. He's 16 years old  dropped out of school at 11  and now makes $4000 a month writing books. Living the dream. He still goes to extracurricular activities at his school to maintain his friendships  but other than that he is light years ahead of his classmates in education and opportunity. 4) BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LIBERAL ARTS? There was a study done: quiz students 1 minute after they get out of class and then 50 minutes after they get out of a class. After 50 minutes they had almost zero retention of what they learned in the class.
