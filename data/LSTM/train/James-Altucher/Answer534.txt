I like reading books where I feel like my IQ is going up while I am reading it. I) The Rational Optimist. Again an anti-doom and gloom book by the astonishing Matt Ridley. This is another one of those books where your IQ is higher after you read it. J) History of the World is Six Glasses. My kid had to read this for school. And then I read it. It's great to take a well-trodden topic (history) and re-formulate it in terms of what we drank and how the answer to that question is totally what changed history.
