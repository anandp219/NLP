Just as compassion often comes from suffering. The lotus shows the true value of the mud.He started a small meditation by ringing a bell.By coincidence  a company Im on the board of is going on the Nasdaq tomorrow. Im very proud of them.So at 9:30 Im going over to the Nasdaq and the CEO of the company will ring the bell to start the days trading for thousands of companies.Both Thich and the CEO use the ringing of the bell to stop us for a moment. To start something new and amazing. Its all connected.I learn the same thing from both Thich and this CEO.
