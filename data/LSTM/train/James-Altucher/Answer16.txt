Smart people test. Smart people don't take risks. I) WORRYING ABOUT STUFF YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUTToo many people think they have to hire lawyers and accountants and make a logo before they even start their company. Don't do BS stuff. Start your company  make your product  see if people want it  repeat. That's it. One company I don't think I even incorporated until they day before I sold it. Don't have too many meetings. Don't debate forever your list of values. Or your marketing slogan. If you make something people want  then the sale is easy  and you have a company.
