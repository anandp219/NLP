I've lost my money and been scared and lost a business and had people hate me and try to ruin me. I've had people I've loved betray me and reject me. I've had successes that came from hard work and from 100 hour work weeks I thought I would never survive but I learned persistence and I learned how to make it work. And I learned how to succeed and I learned how to survive failure. Some of the time. Experience mixed with childhood is a roller coaster. Is a playground. You swing as high as possible and experience knows you will come down safe.
