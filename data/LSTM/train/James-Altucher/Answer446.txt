He even laughs and says hes lost money on every real estate decision hes made. Hes a liar also. So I dont know. But thats what he says.Theres about $15 trillion in mortgage debt in the United States. This is the ENTIRE way banks make money.They want you to take on debt. Else they go out of business and many people lose their jobs.So they say  and the real estate agents say  and the furniture warehouses say  and your neighbors say  its the American Dream.But does a country dream? Do all 320 million of us have the same dream?What could we do as a society if we had our $15 trillion back?
