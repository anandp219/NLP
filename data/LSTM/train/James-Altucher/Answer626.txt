  THE BENEFITS OF MEDIOCRITYI used to think nothing bad could happen to me. This was confirmed repeatedly when I was a kid by my parents and teachers and  when forced to  my friends. Then one day I failed all of my finals my first semester of graduate school. I was no longer the golden child. The cowboy genius. Another day  a few years later  I cheated on a girl who wanted to marry me. And yet another day  I started a business while working at a full-time job  sometimes doing projects for their competitors.My parents crying  "I can't believe you're our son."
