If she were to disappear tomorrow  I would be lost. So she's hired! But  sadly  she can't spellcheck.----But this post is not about hiring loved ones. It's the reverse. It's about finding the people you love by using a hiring process. Recently I read the book "Who". The authors had interviewed over 20 billionaires  30 CEOS  and dozens of recruiting managers and then developed a process of hiring. They then tested the process over and over again to see if it brought the right people into a business.
