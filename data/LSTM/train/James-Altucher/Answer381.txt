It didnt work out for a host of reasons. I didnt really want to be a professor (the IPO book was ending). I would rather be a writer than a computer scientist (I had no idea what my company even did. We were just trying to ride the IPO boo). And so on. Thomas Edison never said  I failed 10 000 times before I made a lightbulb. The guy was in a LABORATORY. He experimented. And now everyone gets into failure porn and says he failed. Thats BS! John Coltrane didnt fail when he couldnt stay in Miles Davis quartet.
