  The other day I asked an old friend of mine  "Why did everyone hate me at that job? "He said  "everyone thought you were an arrogant jerk." Then they fired me. I had forgotten how to communicate. I had forgotten the basic premise that allowed for the survival of our species. The ability to communicate far better than any other species. RIght now there is writing  instagramming  tweeting  status updates  youtube videos  quora answers  podcasting  and basic one-one communication. We have to learn the basic tenets of communication so that in this world where we receive up to 20 000 messages a day in all of it's varieties  our communications can rise to the top.
