And then with all of the above  I have to repeat. A lot of writers will say you have to write a lot. This is not really as true as people think. It depends what you want to write. If you want to write a piece of literary fiction  you probably need to write a lot. If you want to write 600 pages on butterflies  you have to sit down and write a lot. Only because sitting down that long to do anything is very difficult. If someone wrote a book: "How to sit down for 10 000 hours and not get bored while staring at a luminescent screen" then that would probably be a good book about how to write better.
