Bill Gates is often his bridge partner.Try it for one week: no computer  no cell phone  play a game for at least 12 hours for the week. (Buffett and Gates playing bridge)8 ) LoveUgh  I was going to do 10 of these but Im getting tired. Theres a fun story about how he actually took over Berkshire Hathaway. It was more ruthless than anything JR Ewing would do. And Im not going to mention the intertwining personal relationships he had. Thats well-documented everywhere. But I give him credit for being open  unconventional  and living the life that best suited him with the least amount of stress.
