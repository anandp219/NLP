But this is the best example of: if you remove or add one word from this book it will make the book worse). 5) The Road by Cormac Macarthy (same as above  only in a dystopian science fiction world). 6) Interview with a Vampire. (I haven't read this book in over 20 years. But I still remember how she had small chapters and ended every small chapter with a cliffhanger. So I always had to turn the page. If all you do is remember: how can I make the reader read the next sentence  you win). I don't even like books about vampires but if I am being honest about what influences me  this one is it.
