BAM! Seems like an amazing idea. Put a Facebook ad up  with the design of the water bottle and say  "30g PROTEIN WATER". Simply see if people click. If noboody clicks  then you have a bad idea. If a lot of people click  then it's a great idea. This is one example. But this is a very important side-rule that most people don't believe: GOOD ENTREPRENEURS ARE RISK-ADVERSEBefore you risk  test. Before you leave your job  have customers. Before you hire people  have money in the bank. Before you even create you product  test it.
