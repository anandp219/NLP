Then maybe I can crowd fund on kickstarter to give the book away for free. OR  I can maybe print up nano-sized copies of the book so that you can only read it with a microscope but it would only cost me a couple of sheets of paper to print up a million copies. And so on. With the solar panels  I can call up SpaceX and see how much it would cost to rent space. For the microbe that desalinatesI have no idea. Can you help me?You dont ever have to look at these ideas again. The purpose is not to come up with a good idea.
