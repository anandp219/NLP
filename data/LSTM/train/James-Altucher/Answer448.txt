The house cant get sold.And the bank that was so friendly lending the money  starts calling within 12 hours of not getting their check. And then starts suing me.Usually when I make an investment  Im not the one getting sued. Except when I buy a house.ISNT RENTING LIKE THROWING MONEY DOWN THE TOILET?No  renting is like making money. And I will tell you how.Lets say you want to buy a $500 000 house at a 6% mortgage.You put $200 000 down.The entire house would rent for about $2500  give or take. So thats 80 months or almost eight years worth of rent you just gave to the bank in a single check.Do you ever get that bank money back?No  because after mortgage debt (most of which cannot be written off in taxes)  property maintenance  and taxes (which go up with inflation and are almost never considered in the price of the house)  closing costs  buying costs  title insurance  property upgrades  etc.
