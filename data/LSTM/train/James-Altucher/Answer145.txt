It's a great business to be in if you can get it. 2) CHEAP ALTERNATIVESThe other day I spoke to Scott Young. For $2000  and in ten months time  he got an MIT Computer Science degree. How did he do it? They put their entire course load online. Maybe this will stop at some point. They do it because they know people still think it's worth it to spend $200 000 to do the exact same thing Scott did but still get that piece of paper that says "BS". When employers were asked  "would you hire Scott even though he doesn't have the actual degree?"
