  Keep saying it anyway.Mahatma Gandhi (a very unexpected person in this context  I admit)  is reported to have said - "First they ignore you  then they laugh at you  then they fight you  then you win. "If you are being ridiculed  congratulations! You are already past the first stage; you have society's attention. Say it more  say it louder  say it with all your conviction. When you see the smiles fade and the their foreheads crease  prepare yourself for the judgements  the " stop it  this is not funny any more" statements  and the 'silent' treatment.
