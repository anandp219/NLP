China is also not a free  democratic country  and running from a Syrian dictatorship into a Chinese dictatorship is like  well... more or less the same thing.Also  China is not particularly known for being inclusive of diverse cultures  which can be seen from its own history; how it systematically 'blended in' all the diverse cultures  languages  communities etc. into one identity. Muslims in Xinjiang province are clearly not comfortable as a minority group. This can be reason enough for Syrian refugees to avoid opting for China  where the chances of preserving and practising their own culture are pretty bleak  as their host country.
