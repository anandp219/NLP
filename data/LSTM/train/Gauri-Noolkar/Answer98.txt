Darker skin is gaining some footage  and the value associated with defining and accepting beauty beyond skin colour is on the rise. However  the mainstream definition of beauty is yet to change  and it still equates good looks with fair skin.It is equally true that the society is more and more accepting of realism in various media  and that acceptance also extends to those working in it. However  the first instinct is always to spot the physical beauty of the model/actor/celebrity in question  and then  by conscious understanding  we mould our thinking to accept the person as he/she appears  and recognize that alternative definitions of beauty exist.
