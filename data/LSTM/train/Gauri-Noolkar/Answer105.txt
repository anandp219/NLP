Consequently  it is not a tourist destination for most of us. The enmity with America  the 'closed' and non-democratic nature of the country (we hardly hear any news from there! )  combined with the very popular NWMD  makes Iran look like a nebulous and slightly fearful country  albeit with an awareness that it isn't bad towards India.In short  we know pretty much nothing about modern day Iran - its society  economy  natural beauty  education  trends  customs  and issues. We are not sure of what we know either.
