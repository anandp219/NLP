Opting for the Vedic rituals of marriage  we also looked to include the five elements of nature - the panchamahabhutas - in our wedding. The open sky (akash)  the clean air (vayu)  the holy yajna (agni)  the sea (jal)  and the red soil of Anjarle (prithvi) were direct participants in the ceremony.The philosophical bit apart  simply going back to clean air  the sea roaring in the distance  the birds twittering on trees  the sweet smell of acacia nuts and bananas  the quiet sunshine pouring through plantations  and the slowing down of time can do wonders.
