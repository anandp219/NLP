As to why Arab countries are not being questioned  well most of them are either in no condition to accept refugees (Yemen and Iraq for example)  or hold enough clout to refuse refugees point blank. It is true that they should be roped in  though.The refugees are not an 'Arab' responsibility  they are a global responsibility. Countries which turn them away for short term problems and goals risk creating resentment and more fundamentalism. Countries which actually take them in are faced with the additional tasks of convincing the host population and putting in extra efforts -social  economic  political  cultural- to make sure that the refugees gel in with the society in order to prevent future social tensions.
