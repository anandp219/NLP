  As Abhijeet said  the 'rest of Maharashtra' is too diverse to be clubbed together  but while it can still glue together as a state over quite a few aspects  Mumbai stands apart - and no  it's not just because of the roaming charges you start incurring once you enter Mumbai.Mumbai is more cosmopolitan and 'least Marathi' than the rest of Maharashtra. That is manifest most clearly in terms of language and food  but also through entertainment options  customs and subtly  through clothing. The Marathi spoken across the state varies from sub-region to sub-region  and so do foodstuffs and customs  but Mumbai is starkly different  with areas that don't speak any Marathi at all  don't sell any Maharashtrian food or food products  and have no inkling of local Marathi festivals.Mumbai beats each and every city in the state when it comes to pace of life.
