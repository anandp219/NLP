  The few answers here have covered most points  so I won't repeat those. Instead  I'll mention five interesting qualities of Indians (which I always took for granted) which I (re)discovered through conversations with non-Indians.1. Survivors.Indians are survivors. They have survived invasions  famines  oppression  violence - you name it  and they still manage to scrape through and come out quite decently in the end. These are the 'all's well that ends well' people  those who sincerely believe that everything happens for 'good'  that adversity is simply God's way of testing us and hence we should still be kind and compassionate no matter what befalls us.I have had foreigners point this out to me as a fact that struck them as naive and marvellous at the same time.
