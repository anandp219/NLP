It was on Quora that I actually learnt that a lot of things that we take in our stride (and I am regularly 'guilty' of) are utterly horrifying to a lot of Westerners  however  I have had quite a few Western friends tell me that the ease at which Indians accommodate even the most insane things amazes them.3. Colours.Indians are bright  bold and dazzling. While women flaunt every colour recognised by the human eye  the men are not left behind as well. We splash colours throughOur clothesOur foodyes  that's blue.Our artOur moviesOur GodsOur housesOur festivalsand the list goes on.Many non-Indians I met found that overwhelming at first  but it did not take them much time to adjust  and then grow fond of our zest for colours.
