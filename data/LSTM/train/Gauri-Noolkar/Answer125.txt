They say that you can be a Canada and still retain your culture  identity and religion  which is not always possible in the 'melting pot' of America  and that makes Canada a favourite destination for most Indians.Except the cold. Canadian winters are dreaded by we Indians who are used to enjoying plenty of mildness in our winters (except the northerners  but then  North Indian winter is still mild compared to Canadian winter). The snow is attractive  at least for the newbies or those who have never been to Kanedda or seen snow in their life.
