Karna appeals to the common Indian mindset for all of these and most importantly  because he matches exactly what we all wish to be.Over years  the grey scale of the Mahabharata has been played down  and characters have been largely singled out to be so good/bad that the common public no longer relates to them. It either places them on a pedestal  or dumps them altogether  but pretty much none of the characters gets them so involved. Karna appeals to people's emotions; his tragedy pulls heartstrings  his sacrifices awe us  his generosity and friendship make us yearn for a friend like him and to be like him  and his final defeat on the battlefield leave us with a loss  a sense of helplessness and fiery respect for the great warrior and man he ultimately developed into.Delve into our popular culture - movies  books  tales  plays  songs - and observe the hero's qualities; I would be surprised if you cannot relate them to Karna.
