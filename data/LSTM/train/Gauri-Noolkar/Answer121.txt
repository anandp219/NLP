"Money-minded" Mumbai. Mumbaikars are frequently criticised by other Maharashtrians  for their "money-minded" approach; there is definitely a certain degree of generalisation in this  but I wouldn't be wrong to say that Maharashtrians find Mumbaikars excessively money-oriented  measuring everything only in monetary terms.Mumbai lives 'in the present'. Perhaps because it hardly has any significant pre-British history  or perhaps because it just does not care  Mumbai doesn't care about histories and glories as much as the rest of Maharashtra does.
