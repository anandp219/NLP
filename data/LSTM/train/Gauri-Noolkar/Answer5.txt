  The best way to kill loneliness is to be comfortable being with yourself.Sure  you could join groups and activities to meet people  but it gets exhausting after a while  especially if you seem to be the one continually putting in efforts with other people. It is a harsh fact that people are drawn more naturally towards 'people' people  and unless you are an easy extrovert thrown into unfortunate  circumstantial loneliness  you will find it very difficult to draw people towards you. I would still suggest keeping people in the loop  but instead of focusing on them excessively  focus on yourself.
