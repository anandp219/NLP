Commercial companies are not drivers of social change; they can only choose to be  and any that does so would be an exception  not the rule. The intention behind advertising is to make sure that their product appeals to the mainstream  i.e. the majority of the population  and hence  whatever is good for them is good for the company's product. Companies are genuinely not interested in sacrificing the mainstream profit-generating majority for a sliver of offbeat  liberal  intellectual thinkers. At the very least  they are quite clear and frank about it.
