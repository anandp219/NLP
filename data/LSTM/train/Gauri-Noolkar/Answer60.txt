  The principal reason for widespread anaemia among Indian girls is poor dietary habits. Girls naturally need more iron  and it is important that they take active efforts to increase and maintain their haemoglobin levels. An effective diet is vital in doing so.A large portion of the Indian population is vegetarian  which means they do not eat meat  fish and eggs  which are rich in iron and proteins. While vegetarian diet too can be iron and protein rich  there is little to no effort taken in including the relevant foodstuffs in daily diet.
