  The best thing about an Economics degree is that it gives you a lot of choice. The worst thing is that the choices are too many.The obvious choices for you are data crunching in MNCs  teaching and banking and finance. You will not find it hard to get a job  and you will earn well. However  if these do not interest you  and you are not set upon one particular goal  then it can be confusing  because then you will be possessing quite a few important skills which a lot of people need  but with no clue as to where you would enjoy/gain from applying them.
