With little time  resources and focus to work on things diligently  we just go about fixing them as and when they break down.A similar thing happens when we commute. We know we have to be some place at some time. Many a times  we also know how much traffic we would have to encounter and how long it would take to go there. Yet  since we already have our hands full fixing other stuff  we simply do not have the time to sit and plan all our tasks in such a way that we get that exact time frame to make the commute and reach in time.
