And you can have some irani chai and bun maska at Goodluck Cafe  which has been catering to Pune's tastebuds since 1935. There are a lot of forts around Pune  so trekking is a big thing here. Sinhagad is a very popular destination. There are many trekking groups in Pune  and most of them are decent to go with. I recently met a wonderful one  and if you wish to learn more from/about them  PM me.I hope this helps.
