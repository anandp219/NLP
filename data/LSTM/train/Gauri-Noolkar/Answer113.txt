It is to see a man who raised you 'like a boy' to suddenly look suspiciously at all boys who might have glanced a second time at 'his girl'. It is to see a man who pushed you to be 'independent' all your life to be extremely unsettled to see your individualistic approach in your adult life  especially in your marriage. It is  in short  to be raised by a bundle of contradictions and explosive emotions  one you never understand  but are attached to  anyway.There is no one way to describe how an Indian father raises his children.
