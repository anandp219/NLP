Hell  I feel it beats every city across the country as well. Mumbai is incredibly fast  hurtling continuously towards achieving one goal  only to hurtle again towards the next. Anyone who paints a picture of Maharashtrians based on Mumbai's pace will be surprised to know that Maharashtrians in the rest of the state  including those in more developed cities like Pune  Nasik  Kolhapur  Aurangabad and Nagpur  are way slower  relaxed and chilled out and have a lot more time in their hands.Rest of Maharashtra is more conservative than Mumbai.
