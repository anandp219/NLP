The Shivaji fad being largely political and an exception  Mumbai is largely indifferent to any historical pride. The rest of Maharashtra  notably cities like Pune  Kolhapur  Aurangabad and Nasik have a strong element of historical pride as they have been important political and/or cultural power centres at different points of time. Many more can be perceived  but it is quite challenging to state them without risking inaccurate generalisation. The ones mentioned above  however  hold ground to a considerable extent.
