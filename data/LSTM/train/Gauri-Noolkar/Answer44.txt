How much do they know about their constituency - the demographics  the economy  the environment  the history and cultural heritage  the current trends? What are the current and future issues? How will they solve them? What are the issues they have already tackled or are tackling? How did they do it/are they doing it? In addition  they should also be tested for their understanding of politics  psychology  futuristic studies  environment  decision-making skills  and mental health.I am sure a country which can come up with the most lengthy (and comprehensive) Constitution of the world can come up with such customised tests for selecting their governments and legislators.
