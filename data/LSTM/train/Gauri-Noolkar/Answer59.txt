No  I don't sing. I like arts of all kinds  but they take too much effort to master or even do quite well at  and all the slogging takes the focus off expression. Because I cannot bottle up.I am not among those who can keep things on their minds and their lips sealed tight. I need to express. Pregnant silences can kill me  and I need to pour out whatever's on my mind  however silly or inappropriate it may be.Also  I cannot - will not - physically fight  destroy property  or engage in any violent act to get a point across  no matter how pertinent it is.I write to express.
