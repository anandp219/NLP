Anaemia is more common among rural girls than urban ones  and one important reason is socio-cultural discrimination. Even today  girls are neglected in the face of their male siblings; their diet and nutrition  just like their education  assume secondary status in a typical rural Indian household. The health of young married women  pregnant women  and young mothers is also not given priority  especially if they do not produce male heirs. This is not immediately obvious  especially to urban observers  but a very important obstacle in tackling anaemia among Indian women.
