As the most important person  you have the capacity to find happiness within you  if you dare. You have the right to get rid of everything that you are not  and begin to eliminate falsehood from your being. The more in harmony with the truth you become of who you are  the more happiness can emerge because you fall deeply in touch with your own true self. When you step into the shoes of the most important person that you are  your whole relationship to life will take on a new dimension. Some call it the power of now.
