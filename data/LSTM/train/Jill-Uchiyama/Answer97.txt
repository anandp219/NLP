  When my brother and I were little we used to laugh at my mother's hair. She wore it teased really high  like a lot of women in the 1950's and 60's  only she kept it that way all of her life. We used to say that when we were lost in a store  all we had to do was look over the aisle and see mom's hair floating above the shelves. Then we were found.In 2002  I went through one of the hardest points of my life- a divorce. I cannot even begin to convey the devastation I felt after only a few short years of marriage.
