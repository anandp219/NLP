  Someone who becomes part of your brain  literally. You get this person. They get you. They know you deeply. You know them deeply. In fact  even if you have separate lives  separate partners  separate jobs  and live in separate cities- when you get together with this person- you just feel you are with yourself in some way. A good friend makes you feel that comfortable. As if you are with yourself in the best way. Their company is like a warm coat on a chilly day  a small breeze on the ocean  a wink from a blinking evening star.
