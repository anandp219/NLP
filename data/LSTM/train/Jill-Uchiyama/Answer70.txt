I taught hundreds of Japanese people and based on more than dozens of conversations  the topic of golf came up frequently. In fact  I used to debate with my male students (in particular) as to why golf was so riveting to them as I have always found it boring.What I heard  time and time again  was first the expense of playing golf in Japan. It cost (as of the late 90's) around $300 to even get on a golf course. This is exponentially higher than in other countries. Check out this article in the New York Times written in the 80's.
