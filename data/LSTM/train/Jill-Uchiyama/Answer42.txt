  I'll never forget being in a crowd in Osaka  watching these amazing fireworks which were rumored to be the "best in the world". I was in a crowd of thousands of Japanese people. And every time the sky would light up with an explosion of intense color  beauty  and overpowering grandeur  I could hear this word  sugoi  popping out of each woman and man as if it were the only word ever uttered in human history.Sugoi! Sugoi! Sugoi!That is the essence of this word to me. It's surprise wrapped around awe-struck beauty.
