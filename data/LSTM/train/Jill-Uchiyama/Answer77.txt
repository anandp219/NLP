  If you are interested in sponsoring a child in Guatemala who needs your help with access to a great education  I highly recommend my friend's organization. It's called "Integral Heart Foundation" and they are doing incredible work with kids. For as little as $35  you can sponsor a child for one month of education and provide a family food basket.These kids come from the poorest of the poor and thanks to Integral Heart  they are receiving the most cutting edge education in the world. The organization has developed incredibly in ten years and has been endorsed by many large corporations and organizations.
