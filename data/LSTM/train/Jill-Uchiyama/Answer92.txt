There is space to breath and in that  the objectification of those thoughts- such as referring to the past- will begin to diminish in importance.This is really the big lesson: you want to diminish the importance of those thoughts  not necessarily get rid of them (which may not be possible anyway). So the goal is not to just live in the present- it's to develop a positive relationship to your thoughts  whether they are negative in nature or not. To be untouched by them  really  and not to be victimized by them.
