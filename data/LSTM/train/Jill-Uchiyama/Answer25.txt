  Shame and lambaste the OP.It is unfortunate when responders shame  humiliate  tear down  chastise or insult the OP  even if the question pushes buttons. If the question is fair  and does not go against the BNBR policy  it deserves a fair response- not a hostile one. Many people are using Quora as an avenue for striking out at other people they don't agree with. This is just a downer.Making huge assumptions in their responses without really finding out what the true situation is that sparked the question is a really big problem on Quora  and one of the things I dislike the most about it.
