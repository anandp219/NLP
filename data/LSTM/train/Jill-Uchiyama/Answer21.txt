There is professional suicide as well- CEO's who step down because of the failing or mishandling of the company. Soccer coaches who lose an important game fire themselves and end their own careers. This form of "person removal" is found all over the culture and a consistent story on national TV.It is the honorable thing to do when mistakes are made.This value of self-sacrifice was best exemplified during World War II. And while this is such a strange and chilling action for the westerner to understand  it certainly is not for the fundamentalist who will literally die for their cause  religion  or family.For those of us in the west  we may ask ourselves whether there is anything so extreme worth dying for -outside of a war.
