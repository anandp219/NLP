It was more than golf. It was a spendid vacation and we were pampered to the nth degree. Having grown up with golf in my family (my father was caddy master at the local golf course down the street from my high school)  I myself grew up on the golf courses in Indiana. No big woop. It was kinda fun. Not my thing. Boring  yet serene. I liked riding the golf carts.But my Japanese family. Whoa. Where my father paid less than a couple of Lincolns in the 80's to play golf down the road  my father-in-law boasted a $100 000 membership at his resort.
