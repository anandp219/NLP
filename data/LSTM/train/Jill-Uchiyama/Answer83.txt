  As a Top Writer  I will let you know that I am not special either. I am one of billions just like you. And being one of billions  means that we are part of one great moving evolving process in this thing called life. As a Top Writer  I can find ways to be special. I can attach my ego to my little badge given to me by people that I don't even know. I can say that I've written a few things that have touched other people. I can say that I've enjoyed writing here and have enjoyed even more getting good feedback and even being published.
