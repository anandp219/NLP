The loss of presence to those around him coupled with a lack of room for creating conversation in a mutually satisfying way. In essence  when we know too much and don't give a damn how it affects others  we become out of sync  out of harmony. And the possibility of embracing the unknown dries up. There is nothing wrong with knowing alot but like anything  if it is used for selfish reasons  receptivity to the knower will be devalued and his (or her) superiority will usually get shunned.
