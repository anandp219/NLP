  You are the most important person in the world.What this refers to is the importance you hold in taking yourself seriously  knowing that you are the chooser and the only one able to map out your life with each footstep  with each decision. Once you become an adult it all falls on you. You have to continue to question yourself and the direction you are going  because if you decide not to take a direction- the world and everyone in it- all the forces at work- will choose one for you.Being the most important person in the world requires the willingness to really be here.
