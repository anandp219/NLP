Independence involves disagreement- and you are hard pressed to find that expressed openly in Japanese culture.There is a strong dependence in Japan on its cultural norms  expectations  and adherence to rules and to the hierarchy. It is not just suggested  it is expected. Independence is not rewarded. If you look at women  for example  you will find many who will reach a certain age and if they are not already married  they will hit that glass ceiling fast if they manage to get a position beyond office worker and making tea for others.
