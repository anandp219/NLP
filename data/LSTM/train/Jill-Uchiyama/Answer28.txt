  That which you are seeking is causing you to seek.There are many paths to the inner world and you are already on one by asking this question. How can you be separate from spirit or your own true self  and not know about it? In many cultures which focus on materialism  we have never been taught how to develop spiritually. The fact that you are interested in finding out how to develop spiritually means that you are ready to consciously develop spiritually. Your consciousness has expanded to include spiritual development which is very different from other forms of development such as cognitive  emotional  physical  or financial development.
