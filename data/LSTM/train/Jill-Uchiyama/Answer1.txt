  Here are some practices and habits that have had an impact on my life:1. Asking myself  "What do you want to create?" before going to an important meeting  event  or date. This habit is really life changing and puts you in the director's chair in life. It allows you to stop and think about the purpose of participating in that event  with those particular people  and creates an urgency to think about the reason for it. In this way  you are creating something in life  rather than being a passive participant.
