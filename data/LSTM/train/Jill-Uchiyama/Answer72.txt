Learning the skill and orientation of how to heal your own wounds can lead you to a very different life. The question is  how conscious do you want to be?This takes work. It takes openness. It requires the willingness to leave the victim behind. To stop blaming the world for your pain and begin to heal yourself so that you can live a completely different orientation to life.Thriving is when life really begins. Everything up until that is painful drudgery with moments of happiness. I believe if everyone were taught this at an early age- this incredible skill of how to self-partner  our lives would be beyond our dreams.
