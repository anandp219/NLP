We hugged and kissed goodbye and she had tears in her eyes like she always did when we parted. All of my life I had left my parents at some bus stop and they stood there faithfully with tears of sadness at my leaving. I was normally the one getting on the bus  but this time it was her leaving me behind. I stood there faithfully  as she boarded the bus  just like she always did for me. I saw her take a seat by the window. We waved goodbye and as I watched the bus go down the street  all I could see was the silhouette of her hair getting smaller and smaller in the distance.
