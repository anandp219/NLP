It is truly the pinnacle of her career  and sadly  the last recording she ever makes before alcoholism takes her life a few short months later. If there were ever a reason to see a tragedy such as Amy  it is for this recording with Tony on "Body and Soul." Just as the world became infatuated with her  we witness again  the shameful primitive invasion around such fame (shame on Jay Leno for turning on her). But graciously  we are given one last chance to spend some time in Amy's world- two hours to be exact- witnessing what could have been the most famous singer of our time  had she lived a little longer.
