"There is a huge difference between the feeling of being in love and what it means to be truly loving. Being in love serves the function in bringing two people together and forming a bond. As powerful as it feels and even as all encompassing as it is  being in love  the state of it  is really not that deep. It is not attached to morality. It isn't associated with being a good partner  a peaceful person. This is why it is so easy for people to fall in love but much much more difficult to stay connected and committed.
