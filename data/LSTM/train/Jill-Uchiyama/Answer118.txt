  My advice is do it. Take the position in Thailand if that suits you better.As someone who has also chosen the helping professions over making money  as well as living abroad in different places- you cannot change your own mind if this is the path that makes the most sense to you.I did it this way and even dedicated a decade of my life to experimenting in a spiritual community that I wholeheartedly believed in. My aspirations have always been lofty and  perhaps  over the top. To be sure  they have never been mundane.But as I stand on my 47th birthday today  I will tell you  there is a price to pay for this nomadic life.
