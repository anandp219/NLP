In Melanie's work  she speaks about the need to learn how to "self-partner"- which has to do with becoming clear about your subconscious wounds from the past (yes  I know it sounds like psycho-babbble  but hang in there with me)  uplevel them  heal them  and re-wire yourself. The goal is to be conscious of your triggers  and to move out of victimization to thriver mentality so that you can attract loving people into your life  rather than abusers. She has developed her own recovery program and many free videos  articles  and webinars you can check out on the web.
