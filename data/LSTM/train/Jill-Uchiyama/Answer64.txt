  Being adopted  I was very much like you. I had no access to my past beyond just a few ideas which were passed along to me by my parents. I had no real idea what my ethnic background was for sure  and certainly knew nothing beyond what my biological parents were rumored to be. Then came 23andMe- Time Magazine's "Best Invention of 2008". I was first introduced to this life-changing website and testing service through an article written by Steven Pinker (The Language Instinct) at Harvard. I read his experience of doing 23andMe in a published article in the Boston Globe about 6 years ago.
