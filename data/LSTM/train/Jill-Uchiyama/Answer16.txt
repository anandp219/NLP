Hyped up American war hero stories are reenacted by obnoxious 1940's sounding American radio hosts- broadcasting American triumphs in particular battles. This was one of the most shocking and uncomfortable things I have ever heard overseas. Japanese have been trying to shake free and independent from the American military presence in Japan for decades. So  for the record  there is a profound lack of independence in Japanese culture and this creates tremendous pressure for people of all ages.
