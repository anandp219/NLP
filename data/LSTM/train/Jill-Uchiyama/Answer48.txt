I could not top it. I could not fathom anything more powerful. Reading it was like entering a poem that transformed me as I gasped at the actions of my own fellow human beings and as I witnessed God Himself die in the eyes of thousands. Night made me believe in evil and know that it can exist again inside me  or you  or anyone. It bore witness to the lowest form of human behavior. But it also changed me for the better. Because in that suffering that was witnessed  I let it transform me into a heartbroken human being.
