This isn't easy for certain races such as African Americans  who may never trace back their heritage because their lines have been cut by forced migration and slavery. Luckily with DNA testing  there is hope. And now many more people are able to know not only where they came from 200 years ago  but thousands. When this catches on to other groups of people in the world  it has the potential to revolutionize how people see themselves- as not just belonging to a country or a region  but to the entire world.
