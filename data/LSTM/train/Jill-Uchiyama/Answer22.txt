It is a theme that is so engrossing because our take on "failure" is just not that important. Failure is a form of success  or at least  can lead up to it. In fact  we barely believe in it. All of our heroes and heroines have failed. They got up and tried again. This is completely opposite of the Japanese.However  there is a new worry in recent decades in Japan. Suicide among depressed and socially isolated people has been changing the intention behind suicide in Japan. These are different reasons for suicide which have more to do with the psychological welfare of the individual- not to do with the group.This is the suicide that  perhaps  will begin to change the mind of Japanese culture: the young person who refuses to become part of society  the young person who is under too much pressure to perform at school  the ones who do not feel loved by their parents.
