Like all of our moves just play out in some big story that we have no dominion over. So what do you do on days like this? When you think there is no hope for turning it around?Look at the sun. Look at the moon. Look at a friend. Gaze at a body of water. Look at the leaves blowing. Search for the face of an animal. Anything natural will do. Just look at it  intently  for a while. Let its energy carry you away a little. Let it wash over you with something warm  something simple  something that feels right.
