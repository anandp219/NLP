But this introduction went like this:How can we explain the hate that burns in so many homes?It was a topic I was familiar with. Hatred. Even though I was reading this from a candlelit room 5 decades past the life of this story  hatred still persisted and persists. And so  I was compelled from the moment I picked it up by the narrative  the honesty in that voice of an old man remembering what it was like to be 15 at Auschwitz. I was grabbed by the throat as a young Wiesel lost more than his entire family  but would be forever changed by being a survivor  compelled to remember- for the sake of everyone and for history -what it was like to see God die in the form of a young boy hanging on the Gallows  along with all the people who perished  needlessly  inhumanely  decidedly  and with such organized precision.This story spoke to the depths of my soul.
