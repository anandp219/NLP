But I wouldn't put it off until next week (or next month or next year). I would take a deep breath and tell her immediately. Right now. Holding that stuff in for even a short time is toxic. It's going to come out somehow  anyway. Even if I successfully hide part of myself from her  it will come out as anger  nervousness  depression  or stress-based illnesses. It will rot the marriage. Maybe the marriage can't withstand the truth  but it definitely can't withstand lies. So the truth must out. Now!
