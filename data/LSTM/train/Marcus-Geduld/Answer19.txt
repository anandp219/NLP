  We wouldn't coexist. They extinction event that wiped out the large (non-bird) dinosaurs created an ecological niche which allowed our ancestor species to flourish. If you're asking about some magic scenario in which  somehow  dinosaurs continued to exist in a world with humans  we'd almost certainly have wiped they out long ago  as we've done with most large animals. Perhaps a few species would still exist  if our ancestors had found a way to domesticate them. Most animal species can't be domesticated.
