2. Play together. I don't mean Monopoly or catch. I mean that every day we get into tickle fights  giggle like lunatics  turn household items into puppets  etc. We are totally used to looking absurd around each other. We have no shame. We are totally free to roll around in the mud together. 3. Work on big projects together. We co-run a theatre company. At the moment  it's dormant  and so we're taking sewing classes together. We each have some individual interests that the other one doesn't share  but there's never a day when we don't spend at least some time talking about shared projects.
