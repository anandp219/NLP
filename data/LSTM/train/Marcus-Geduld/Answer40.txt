The more upset he gets  the more he needs to win. It's like he came in needing his ego topped up a little  but each further interaction drained his tank a bit more. Now it's almost empty and he's desperate. I won't give him points for logic; I won't play his sarcasm game. Eventually  he'll cut his losses and say ...Someone: You know  I have better things to do that waste my time talking to someone as close-minded as you...He'll feel a little bit better for getting a dig in as the last word. But he'll still have a gaping wound to staunch.
