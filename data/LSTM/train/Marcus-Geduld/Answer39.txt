My stance is exactly what I wrote  above. That and only that.Someone: Ah! A classic back-peddle. Congratulations. You must be proud of your hypocrisy! Me: When did I back-peddle.Someone: You claimed [blah]. Now you're claiming [blah blah].Me: No. If you read my fourth paragraph  you'll see that I've claimed [blah blah] all along. Where in my post do you see me claiming [blah] or anything like it?Nothing has helped the other guy with his goal of winning. The longer I respond calmly  the more upset he gets.
