If there's a problem  it's our problem. Here's the final way we got lucky: our parents. My wife's mom and dad  now both gone  were happily married for over 50 years. Mine are still alive and still together. They got married in 1962. Their relationship was rockier than my in-laws' was. When I was 14  they split up for nearly a year. Then  they did a lot of hard work  got back together  and stayed together ever after. So both my wife and I grew up seeing marriage as something lasting. I was traumatized by my parents' split when I was young  but I now see it as really valuable.
