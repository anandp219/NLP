Or you remind me of someone who made me feel stupid. (If I say  "I hate comic books " some folks will hear  "People who like comic books are stupid." So even if you're not trying to belittle anyone  someone may wind up feeling belittled just because you've expressed an opinion. This is more-likely to happen if he's been humiliated in the past. )It really sucks to let that go unaddressed. What stops me from trying to beat you over and over is impulse control. It's the same thing that stops me from drinking too much wine  hitting on lots of women  blowing all my money at the casino  and leaving restaurants without paying.
