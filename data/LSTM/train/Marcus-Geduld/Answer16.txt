All of those things would be moral lapses on her part  but her moral lapses don't excuse mine. If I cheat on my wife  it's my fault. If she cheats on me  it's her fault. If we have problems in our marriage--problems that entice me to cheat--that's probably both our faults. The problems our our fault  not my way of dealing with them. I need to take responsibility for that. My wife needs to take responsibility for the ways she deals the problems  too.
