The same is true for most languages. Want to learn Python? I mean really learn it  so you can get a job as a Python developer? If so  learning the language itself will be the easy part. Or at least the short part. It will take you much longer to learn Python best practices  Python IDEs  key Python libraries  etc.Most people want to learn JavaScript for web development. If they're new to web programming  they get discouraged--and I don't blame them--when they realize the language itself wont get them very far.
