My wife is gorgeous  but it wasn't her face or body that won me over. I got lucky in terms of meeting someone really compatible with me. We have similar values  practically the same sense of humor  similar interests  etc. It took me many years to meet someone like that  and  luckily  the women I met earlier--the ones I wasn't so compatible with--turned me down. I would have settled. The attitude part has to do with a strong belief in marriage. By which I mean two things: (1) I take my marriage vows really seriously.
