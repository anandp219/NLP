I wish I could say I was smart enough to wait until I was mature enough for marriage  but that would be a lie. Life made me wait until I was mature enough. I will say  though  that many of the dateless nerds I know--the ones who married relatively late--have had successful marriages for similar reasons. You look at them now and think  "These guys and gals are solid. They knew what they want. They know how to get it. Their youthful egos have melted away. They're kind. They're loyal..." They're marriage material!
