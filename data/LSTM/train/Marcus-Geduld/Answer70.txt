The same is true for it's functional aspects. The first language I learned* was LISP  which is a functional language  so the idea of first-class functions  pure functions  and immutability weren't odd or difficult for me when I encountered them in JavaScript. But to someone who has never done functional programming before  there will be a learning curve  especially if he's spent a lot of time coding in non-functional languages. It's relatively easy to learn metric if it's your first measurement system.
