Example: Here's an old-style Javascript function:123var foo = function(num) { return num + 1;} Here's one way to write it in ES6:1let foo = num => num + 1; Because we're in a transitional period  JavaScript books  courses  articles  and tutorials may use either format or a mixture of the two--as may source code a newbie has to read. So  unfortunately  this means you need to learn both syntaxes when you're first starting. Which is a bit like trying to learn Spanish and Portuguese at the same time.
