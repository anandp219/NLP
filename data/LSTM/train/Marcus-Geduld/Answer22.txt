  It's incoherent. Everything is natural. It's impossible for us to create matter out of nothing  so everything we make is made out of ingredients from nature. If you define "unnatural" as "altered by humans " then a carrot is unnatural as soon as you dig it up. Carrots in the wild don't dig themselves up. Perhaps "natural" means "something we haven't altered very much." In which case you have to avoid all domesticated plants and animals. Pears are unnatural  brussel sprouts are unnatural  cows are unnatural  chickens are unnatural.
