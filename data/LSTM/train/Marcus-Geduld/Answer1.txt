Some men are turned off by women who don't drink.For some men  such as me  whether or not a woman drinks has nothing to do with whether or not I'm attracted to her. I simply don't care whether she drinks or not. The exception is alcoholics. That's a turn-off to me. But in the range of teetotaller-to-social drinker ... shrug. If you feel pressure to drink  this will probably change as you get older. Drinking is a big deal for lots of college-aged people.
