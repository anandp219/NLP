They needs to know how to use a version-control system (most-likely GIT). They needs to know HTML  CSS  and a CSS pre-processing language  such as LESS. They need to know server-side JavaScript at least well-enough to handle node and npm. And they need to be able to intelligently collaborate with server-side programmers  which means having some level of understanding of web protocols  databases  and so on. Finally  this is a confusing time to learn JavaScript  because many developers have started using ES6 (a.k.a ES2015)  the latest version of the language  which is syntactically very different from past versions.
