I'd be very  very angry. But if you'd be willing to work on fixing the problem  I'd work on it with you." She said she felt the same way. I don't think all marriages should be like that--that they should try to work through anything. But I'm saddened by the number of married folks who work through nothing. They don't see marriage as a thing you work on. They don't consider couples counseling when things go wrong. Sometimes  this is because they don't expect anything to go wrong. When it (inevitably) happens--in what they thought was happily-ever-after--they're totally blindsided.
