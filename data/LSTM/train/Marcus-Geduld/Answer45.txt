Even if I'd met the same women  it probably would have failed. I simply wasn't mature enough back then. I was a mess until was 26 or 27.By the time we met  many aspects of my life had fallen into place. I knew what I wanted to do for a living. I had some skills I was confident about. I'd lived on my own and knew how to pay bills  cook dinner  etc. I was done with my rebellious stage. I was trustworthy. I was hard working. The same was true of my wife--and the same hadn't been true about her a few years earlier  when she was in her early 20s.
