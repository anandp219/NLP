  Many of us hate to lose. Many of us also hate to be in a tie. We only feel good when we win. And what matters  emotionally  is how each person subjectively defined winning. (The amount one hates to lose--and loves to win--is often rooted in early childhood. There may even be a genetic component to it. Which is to say that if someone is trying to beat you  it's probably a continuation of a conflict that's been playing out in his head for years. You are a proxy for daddy  the cool kids in high school  "those people " or whatever.
