I've made it sound as if my behavior caused that wound to worsen  and maybe it did. But in the case of some stalkers  the wound happened years before we ran into each other. I just remind him of whoever originally hurt his feelings. This is often the case with men who stalk women. Each new victim reminds him of some woman (or some group of women) who hurt him--or who he believes hurt him--in the past. You  some new woman  are hurting him just by existing--or by refusing to let him dominate or humiliate you.
