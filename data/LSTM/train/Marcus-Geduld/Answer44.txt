  It's a combination of luck and attitude. I don't want to minimize the luck part. I was lucky in several ways: first  I was one of those nerdy kids who couldn't get a girlfriend. I didn't really date anyone until I was in my mid 20s and I didn't get married until I was almost 30. If you'd called me lucky back when I was a dateless wonder  I would have called you crazy. And had I been more attractive to women  I probably would have gotten married earlier--before I'd been able to handle it. There certainly are folks who married young  made it work  and are still together  but I'm pretty sure my marriage wouldn't have lasted if I'd met my wife before I was 25 or so.
