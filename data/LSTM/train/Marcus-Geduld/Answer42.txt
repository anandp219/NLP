He's a walking wound  and he's going to keep trying to heal himself by winning. In any case  the guy above may feel he can refill his ego tank by engaging me at other times. Yes  he may have lost the battle  but that doesn't mean he has to lose the war. He'll obsessively pour over my posts  looking for a weak spot. If one weak spot fails to work  he'll try another. He'll keep trying until he wins or totally loses  maybe by being kicked off the site. He'll either do that  in which case I'll have a stalker on my hands  or he'll move on to some other proxy--someone with the same opinions as me (or similar ones) who is more of a pushover.
