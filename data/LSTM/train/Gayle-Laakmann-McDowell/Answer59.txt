Yes  the risk is small when it's just isolated incidents of unvaccinated children  but it's a stupid risk to take anyway. It also becomes quite a major risk when a larger percent of the population is unvaccinated. People who don't vaccinate their children are an easy group to hate  judge  and fear. So while unvaccinated children are riskier than unvaccinated adults  some of the "stay away from them" mentality is probably motivated by the aforementioned inclination to hate  judge and fear them.
