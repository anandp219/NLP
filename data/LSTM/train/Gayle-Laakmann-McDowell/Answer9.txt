People usually use "i" when it's something very straightforward  like just looping through this. It has an implication of "ignore this variable -- it's not terribly important." Something like "index" would probably be better here.Avoid that when possible -- and it's definitely possible here. You can do this with just one linear loop forward. That's how the code in the book works.Style & other minor issuesFix your spacing. There should be a space after "for"  "while"  and "if".Be consistent. You can debate whether or not you should have spaces around comparisons (equals  less than  etc)  although virtually every style guideline I'm aware of requires them.
