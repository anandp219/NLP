The questions get harder the better you're doing  so you end up feeling like you're doing worse.Take the GMAT well in advance. I took it last minute  so it was my only shot (and fortunately I did well enough that it wouldn't hurt me  although it also wouldn't really help me). If you give yourself more time  you have the opportunity to retake it. I believe you can "hold on" to your score for up to five years  so you might want to consider taking it after you finish college or between jobs. This will offer you more time to study.Also: if you're applying to the top schools  don't get too hung up on your score.
