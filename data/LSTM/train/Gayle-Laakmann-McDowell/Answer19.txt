Try to solve the problems without the hints  but if you need them--use as few as possible. New strategies / techniques. I've done a lot of interview coaching over the past two or three years. There are a lot of trends and techniques that I see now that I never noticed before. They've even helped me to solve some of the harder problems. :)Lots of Big O. When I wrote the 5th edition  I don't think I realized how many people struggled with big O. Turns out... the vast majority of candidates don't understand it well enough for an interview (even those who think they do).
