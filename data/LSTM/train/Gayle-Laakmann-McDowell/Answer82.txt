"Solutions" obviously needs to be after the questions themselves. "Data Structures" needs to be before "Algorithms"  since they're less complex and the algorithm questions often depend on knowledge of data structures. "Assorted Review Problems" needs to be after all the other questions.So you get this graph for the sections:Applying a topological sort to this  you get the order in the book.ChaptersWithin Data Structures  "Arrays" needs to be before anything else  as it's the most fundamental. It makes sense to me to discuss linked lists before stacks and queues or trees  since linked lists are more basic than either of those.Within "Algorithms"  there isn't a lot of dependency.
