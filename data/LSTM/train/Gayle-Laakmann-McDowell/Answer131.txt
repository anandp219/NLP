It was right for me. It might not be right for you.I dislike templates for me with my experience which use the entire left column to just have headlines like "EXPERIENCE" and "EDUCATION". Sure  it looks pretty. But it wastes so much space.I dislike templates for me with my experience which don't adequately highlight the company names. My resume highlight was company names. I needed reviewers to be able to skim my resume and say  "Wow  she worked at Microsoft and Apple. Let's interview her." Frankly  that's really all I needed to land any interview.
