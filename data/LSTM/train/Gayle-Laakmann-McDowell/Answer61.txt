All of things come a bit easier when you're attractive and know how to put yourself together well.You're writing off caring about your appearance as superficial  but... is all this superficial? Having friends? Grades? Career? Certainly many people go to excess here and care too much about their appearance. People can also care too much about their grades or too much about making friends. The fact that some people over focus isn't a reason to not care.What concerns me with your attitude is that you're just saying it doesn't matter to you  and I'm not sure you've thought through the implications of this.
