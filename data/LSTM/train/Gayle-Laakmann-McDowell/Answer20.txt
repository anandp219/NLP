I have a huge section on big O now. In addition  many of the existing problems have been reworked or rewritten - fixing errors in some cases  clarifying things  adding new solutions/approaches  etc.Programming LanguageI have continued to use Java for this book for a few reasons. First  Java is more widely readable than Python. Pretty much everyone has written Java or a language much like it. Second  while I love Python as a language because it makes some things so easy (for example  doing a quick map or reduce)  that makes solutions in Python a little less broadly applicable.
