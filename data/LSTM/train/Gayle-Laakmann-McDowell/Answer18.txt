(It's like college all over again...)It has 39 more problems. I took out a few problems I didn't really like  so there are probably more like 45 more problems.Hints! I'm really excited about this. I think this will be incredibly valuable. It will help you simulate the interview experience more and develop better techniques  since interviewers give you hints too. Each problem has an average of 5 or so hints (2 or 3 for some of the easiest problems)  and more than 10 for some of the hardest. The hints for each problem are incremental.
