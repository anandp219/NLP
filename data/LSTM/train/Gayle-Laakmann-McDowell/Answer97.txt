  I typically vote as a democrat. More specifically:I lean much more strongly democrat on most social issues (gay rights  transgender rights  black and minority rights  women's rights  gun rights  healthcare  immigration  religious involvement in politics  assisted suicide  etc).I think the increasing disparity between the wealthy and poor is problematic. I'm concerned about the shrinking middle class. Democrats seem more focused on this issue. I somewhat side with republicans on some economic ideas (for example  the value of being fiscally conservative)  but I don't think they have actually executed effectively on this.While democrats have elected their share of stupid people  Republicans seem to take the cake here.
