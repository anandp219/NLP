If we lived in a time where being transgender wasn't a "funny" thing  but just a thing  then absolutely (and we probably will live in this time). Or  if there were a transgender celebrity who just happened to be accepted for this but mocked for something else  then you could have a "funny" costume of him/her that wasn't inherently transphobic.Unfortunately  Caitlyn Jenner doesn't fall into this category. She's most strongly associated with being transgender  and she's being mocked for this. That's what's inspiring this costume.
