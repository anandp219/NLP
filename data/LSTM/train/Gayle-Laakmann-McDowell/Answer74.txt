How do you roll out such a policy at a large company without letting the bar slip to more marginal cases?It's worth noting that  in the vast majority of cases  you can't hire based on someone's prior experience. You can only hire based on how someone discusses it. It's hugely subjective and very coachable. In a "hire on prior experience" process:There are lots of false negatives because candidates don't know how to discuss their prior experience. There are lots of false positive because candidates are able to trump up (sometimes even lie) about what they've done in the past.There are lots of people who are brilliant and would do great work given the right opportunities and mentorship  but haven't gotten that opportunity yet.
