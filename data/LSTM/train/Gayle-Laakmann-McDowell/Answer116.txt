A country with mandatory reporting may have a much statistic  but that doesn't mean the true number is higher. Additionally  some countries might be much less likely to link an outcome with a specific cause  whereas others might be pretty comfortable in saying "mom took drug  baby is deformed  therefore  drug caused deformity."
