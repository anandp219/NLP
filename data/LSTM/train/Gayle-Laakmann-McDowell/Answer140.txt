Find out where they work or live and meet them nearby. Offer to buy them coffee; its not about the money. Its about establishing that you value their time.Be persistent  but only a little. I get a lot of emails and  much as I wish this werent the case  I dont respond to all of them. If this relationship matters to you  follow up. For the most part  I dont refuse to respond to emails. I just havent yet gotten around to yours yet (and I might never).Make them like you. If possible  do something for them.
