If you haven't specifically told them to account for some piece of information  then it won't just magically know to do it.In this case  what's happening is that the version of that book (the 4th edition) is no longer on sale  and it hasn't been on sale for nearly four years. The algorithm doesn't realize that it's not on sale because a newer  better version is. It doesn't realize that it should compare the price to that item and  if anything  be lower.The 5th edition is the latest edition and is a reasonable 530 rupees.
