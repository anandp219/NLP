Their adherence to religion probably has something to do with it. (This is not at all saying that religious people are stupid. It's that screaming the loudest about God seems to be a winning strategy for Republicans. That's taking the focus off more important things  like good decision making. )To put this another way: I'm somewhat torn between the two sides. I could be willing to go against my values and vote republican if there were very strong evidence that Republicans were better for the economy (after all  the economy also has life and death impact for people).
