A different set of assumption could also lead to different answers  such as:7.8 months (if pregnancy starts from the start of the last cycle and there are 4.35 weeks per month)8.5 months (if pregnancy starts from the start of the last cycle and there are 4 weeks per month)8 months (if pregnancy starts from conception and there are 4 weeks per month)Some people might even add a month to each of those  as they might not distinguish between "in the 8th month" and "8 months pregnant".Again  it's really a matter of definitions.
