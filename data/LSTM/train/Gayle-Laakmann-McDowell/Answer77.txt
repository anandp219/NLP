  An "unlimited" (within the first year) parental leave policy might not be as good as it sounds.It's understandable that people are excited about this. It seems like a good thing. It's equal across mothers and fathers; that sends a nice message that babies are not just the woman's responsibility. I think all parental leave should be equal. The flexibility offered through it is nice as well  since not every parent wants to leave full-time.However  I'm deeply concerned about how it will actually play out.From what I've heard  when companies offer "unlimited" vacation or sick leave  employees actually take less time off.
