I don't really understand what this means. Max Howell on Twitter2. Was he rejected because of this question?It's also unclear why he was rejected. Was he specifically told that he was rejected because he couldn't invert a binary tree on the whiteboard? If he had multiple interviews (which is likely  since he was brought onsite)  does he know that it was that interview that led to his rejection? If he did know it was that interview  how does he know why he was rejected? Usually recruiters don't provide that information.Perhaps it had nothing to do with his technical performance and was in fact his communication skills.In my experience  a candidate's assumptions about their performance has no correlation with their actual performance.
