  I don't actually have control over that  interestingly. I set a list price on Amazon  but then Amazon can (and does) arbitrarily drop the price.The list price for the 5th edition is $39.95  but Amazon sells it for $30.05 (right now).The list price for the 6th edition (on pre-order right now) is $39.95  but Amazon has just dropped the price to $27.64. I don't have any control over this; it just happens.So in other words  the price could be anything from $21 to $40 at any given point. On pre-order though  the price is "guaranteed" in that you pay the lowest price as the price varies.Cracking the Coding Interview: Gayle McDowell: 9780984782857: Amazon.com: Books
