That would be quite different (and very admirable).They say it's "unlimited" (within the first year). Now parents need to worry about what's truly acceptable. One year might be normal in other countries (where  notably  leave is typically paid for by the government and not by company)  but it's not normal in the US. You probably won't see a lot of people taking one year just because they can  just as you probably don't see people at Netflix taking three month vacations under their "unlimited vacation" policy.People have to figure out what's acceptable  and that might well mean erring towards the more limited six-week leaves that other companies offer.And  what's worse  this might impact men more than women.
