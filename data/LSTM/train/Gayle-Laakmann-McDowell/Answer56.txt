They don't have the experience fighting off diseases that adults do. If a kid and an adult were both exposed to the same disease  the kid would be more likely to get sick. The adult  therefore  is a bit less of a risk.Fifth  kids are little Petrie dishes of diseases. They roll around in dirt. They lick tables and other kids' toys. They touch sticky things just because they're lying on the ground. They'll pick up anyone's drink and drink from it  just because it's there. They don't have a good sense for "eww  gross!"
