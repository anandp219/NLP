  I got a 750 (out of 800). This is 98th percentile overall  but it's only a little above average for MBA programs like Wharton  Stanford  and Harvard. All three have means and medians around 720 - 730 (around 95th percentile).As I recall  I studied for two or three weeks using the booklets from Veritas Prep. Those are great -- definitely recommend them.I took some practice tests by hand. I did not take any computer adaptive tests as practice  which was a mistake. Some advice/comments for those preparing for the GMAT:I loved the Veritas books.
