  Your mom might not be going about it the right way (or maybe she is--we don't really know)  but either way she has a point. I would encourage you to not brush it off entirely.Whether you like it or not  attractiveness makes your life easier. You'll make friends easier. People will think you're smarter. Teachers and strangers will like you more. You'll get treated better.These aren't just little things about how people see you. These are very real. Your friendships matter. Your grades matter. Your career matters.
