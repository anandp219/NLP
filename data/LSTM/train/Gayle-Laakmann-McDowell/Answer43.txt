Um  okay... so you don't like my name choice because it's unusual  but that's part of why I like it. Again  no value-add  but it was value-subtract. Now I know you don't like the name.You'll tell me that you don't like it because that one jerk you know has the same name. That is obviously meaningless in terms of the general quality of the name  but it's still a value-subtract. Now I know you don't like the name.In other words  your opinion is basically worthless. Your criteria are either stupid or different than mine.
