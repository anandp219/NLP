However  I think you should join Uber instead. You want name brand  and they have that more so than us. The money differences are irrelevant in the long run. Don't make the decision based on that. It's so much more important to go somewhere you are excited to be. And if that's Uber  go for it. You can't go wrong.And so on.It probably would have worked. The candidate probably would have taken the Uber job. The CEO accomplishes the same thing  but now looks super mature  professional  and empathic.
