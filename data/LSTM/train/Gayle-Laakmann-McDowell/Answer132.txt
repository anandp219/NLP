That's probably not your situation though. If your company names actually reflect poorly on you  then you might want to hide your company names and instead highlight your job titles. Formatting like item below is harmful to me but potentially beneficial to you.Software Engineer  Company Name (City  ST)  June 2010 - June 2015I don't care if a template includes the cities of each job. Many people needs this in their resume. I didn't.I don't want to highlight specific skills (languages  software  etc)  but it does need to be on my resume somewhere.I wanted a one page resume.
