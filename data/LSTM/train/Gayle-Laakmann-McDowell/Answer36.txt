)So if concatenating K characters together is K^2 time  then concatenating N^2 small strings together will be O((N^2)^2) time  or O(N^4).Example 3: O(N)This code counts the number of sequences of 5 characters that are the same.123456789array = array of intscount_5_the_same = 0for i from 0 to array.length - 4: all_the_same = true for j = i + 1 to i + 4: if array[i] != array[j]: all_the_same = false if all_the_same: count_5_the_same += 1This code takes O(N) time  where N is the length of the array.Example 4: O(N^2 log N)This code counts how many times the product of two integers within a sorted array is within the array.
