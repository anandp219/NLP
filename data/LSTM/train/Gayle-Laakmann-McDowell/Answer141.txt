The vast majority of mentorship requests I get are from people who have read one or more of my books but havent posted a review on Amazon. Look  Im an author. Reviews are a big deal. If you tell me you love my book and youre asking for help from me  Im likely to think  If you love it so much  why not post a review? I recognize Im being a little unfair here  the prospective mentee probably hasnt really thought about posting a review. But  still  Im a lot more likely to help those who I feel are willing to help me.
