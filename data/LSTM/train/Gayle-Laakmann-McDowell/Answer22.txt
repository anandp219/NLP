  I think what's disrespectful is to presume  with zero knowledge of the parent or child or situation  that we know better than them. Here's the entirety of our knowledge:Someone had a bumper sticker that said "Please be patient  autistic child on board. "That's it. We presume that this was on a car. We presume that this was the parent. We presume that the kid doesn't want their condition known. We presume that the kid is able to even understand what this bumper sticker says. We presume that this was done with no reasonable justification.
