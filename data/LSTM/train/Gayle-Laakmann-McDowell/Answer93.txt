The only thing you can change is whether you got your job by cheating.The question is: Do you want this new job so badly that you're willing to sit with the knowledge for the rest of your life that you kicked off your career and got ahead with dishonesty? From what you said  I believe that you're a generally honest person (perhaps even exceptionally honest) who made a mistake. I'd worry that you'd end up being pretty unhappy at this company as you might never really feel right in the role.The company might still decide to take you if you confess.
