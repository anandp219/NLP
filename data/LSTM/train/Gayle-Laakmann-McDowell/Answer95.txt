I worry that my use of the Internet might have made me seem more qualified than I am.This is behavior is really out of character for me  and I really regret my actions. That's why I wanted to let you know what had happened and see how to proceed.I expect that you will likely revoke my offer with this disclosure  and I absolutely understand that decision (much as I would be disappointed). Alternatively  if you'd like to give me some additional interviews  I would love that opportunity too. I assure you that  regardless of your decision  this will never happen again with this company or another.
