  When I was in college  I TAd for a freshman/sophomore level computer science class. All the TAs were prior students in the class. We had by far the best set of TAs in the Computer Science department.Is that surprising? We surely had much less experience than the other TAs  who were usually PhD students. We didn't have the expertise in the subject area that the PhD students had.But here's the thing: We were great teachers. We were selected not because we were knowledgable in the material (although we had to of course do reasonably well in the class)  but because we could effectively communicate it.They knew we could effectively communicate it because they'd just spent a year interacting with us and watching how we communicate.
