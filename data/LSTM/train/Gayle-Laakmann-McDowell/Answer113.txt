  The way that Amazon works is that anyone can sell an item on there (not just the maker of the item). And  if it's your item that you physically own (or claim to own)  then you can set whatever price you want.It's possible that someone owns a copy of the book and has decided to charge this amount for it. It is ludicrous? Of course. But that's their choice.More likely though  some computer algorithm has said  "Hey  this book is popular and hard to find -- I'll go charge X amount for it." The issue with computer algorithms is that the lack common sense.
