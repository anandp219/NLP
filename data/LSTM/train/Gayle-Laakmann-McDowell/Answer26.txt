Perhaps this parent tends to have trouble getting the child in and out of parking spots. Perhaps this is a vehicle used to transport severely autistic children and  again  they got a lot of hassle before putting this on.Remember that when you ask if a parent should do something  the question is about that parent  not all or even most parents. Most parents shouldn't ration food  but we should. Most parents shouldn't force-feed their kids  but my friend should. Most parents shouldn't use such a bumper sticker  but this parent -- if it even is a parent -- quite possibly should.
