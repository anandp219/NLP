Seriously. Use logical variable names instead that reflect their meaning.Too many people say "O(N)" when they really mean "linear". Well  linear in what? If you have an array of [equal-length] strings  it's really not clear whether your "N" refers to the array or the string length  or something else. Avoiding N as a variable name will prevent you from making a stupid mistake like this: Sorting a string takes O(N log N) time. So if you have an array of strings and you want to sort all of them  it takes O(N*N log N).
