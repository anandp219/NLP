Why do these names seem weird? Because:You're not a baby. They were weird 20+ years ago  but that doesn't mean they're weird now. The names just seem so... black. Very often  the names that people complain about are ones that are associated with black people. Names with equivalent popularity/trends that aren't "black names" don't get nearly as much hatred. (You might not have been consciously thinking this -- I doubt you were. But I'll bet if you presented people with two equally popular names and with equal trends  one that sounds "black" and one that sounds "WASPy"  they'll much prefer the WASPy one.
