  I've definitely heard (frequently) of interviewers selecting questions from Cracking the Coding Interview.However  they shouldn't. When I do interviewing training  I specifically tell companies not to.First  questions in the book are there not because they're necessarily good questions  but because they're useful for candidates to prepare with. The correlation between is strong  but not perfect. For example  brainteasers are in the book even though I don't recommend asking them.Second  and much more importantly  it's stupid to ask questions from the same book that candidates are largely using.
