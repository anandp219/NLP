(Or at least  I can't think of any counter examples  but it's possible I'm missing some additional qualifications. )The important take-away here is to realize that nothing is ever inherently O(N) or O(N^2). N is just a variable and it always has a very specific meaning (although sometimes we infer what it is). Big O is just an equation of variables that reflects the runtime. That equation can be anything and can use any variables.In fact  if you're struggling even a little bit with big O (and even if you're not  this can't hurt): just stop using N as a variable in big O.
