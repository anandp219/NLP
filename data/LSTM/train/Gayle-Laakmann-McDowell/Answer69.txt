  Maybe  maybe not.1. Is this a good question?I can't really comment on the problem as it's not clear what the problem means.Many people have interpreted the problem to mean flipping left and right. In this case  it's a pretty uninteresting trivial problem. It's a bad question  unless maybe early on in the process  because it doesn't really demonstrate much. It's easy. (And I would be somewhat concerned about someone who couldn't do it. )However  the OP later says that it was "to min-max a tree  ascending to descending".
