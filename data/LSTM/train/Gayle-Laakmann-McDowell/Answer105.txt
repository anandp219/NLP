  I have a very unique first name (and  for my first name  a fairly unique spelling). To some of the older Quorans  it might seem fairly mainstream. It's not -- at least not anymore.From Everyone has a name: In 2014  there were just 7 Gayle's born and only 13 Gail's. Interestingly  Abigail is extremely popular -- it's the 8th most common name. Still  people just don't like Gayle/Gail.Fine by me. I've really liked having an unusual name. I find that it helps my career in that I can more easily brand myself.
