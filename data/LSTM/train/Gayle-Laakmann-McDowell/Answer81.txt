  Obviously I applied topological sort to a graph of the dependencies across sections and chapters.First  there was the decision about which chapters and sections to include. Second  I had to draw a directed graph and connected nodes where one should be discussed before the other  either due to a dependency in the material or a difference in complexity. Third  I applied a simple topological sort to determine a linear ordering. There's some randomness to it too.Sections"Introductory Material" obviously needs to be before anything else.
