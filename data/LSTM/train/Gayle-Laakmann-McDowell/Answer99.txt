  Not particularly. I think it's good to discuss what good interview processes look like.However  I do think that many people's points are poorly thought out. (Then again  I think the same thing about pretty much any issue  so it hardly makes it worse here. )Many people's logic is: "Algorithm interviews are broken because of X  therefore we should all switch to Y instead." The problem is that Y is also broken in its own ways. All interview processes have their flaws. Developer Interviews are Broken  and You Can't Fix ItThe other key logical problem people make is the assumption that the interview process should mirror "real life."
