I already asked to PAThelp and they confirm... 4) Now mcEventWeight is extracted in BaseEventSelector first  and is retrieved by all the EL algorithms downstreamCan you explain why you're grabbing the event weight this way instead of using the recommended  eventWeight = eventInfo->auxdecor< float >( "eventWeight" );Did I miss something? What is the extra complexity in here for?In the xAODAnaHelpers Twiki it is said it is preferable in terms of performance to use SG:: Decorator and Accessor. Originally I had the same thing as you said.
