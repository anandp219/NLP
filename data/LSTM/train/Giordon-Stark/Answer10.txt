If there is something that comes in that deserves my attention or I cannot archive for a while  I will pin it. This means it goes to a special place in Inbox where I can view all pinned emails and deal with them later. Finally  I have the snooze feature which allows me to deal with emails later  if I can't deal with them right this second  but they're not worth of being pinned.To summarize - when I go through emails  I either archive because I'm done  quickly reply then archive because I'm done  snooze it for later  or pin it because it's important and I need to refer to it many times over and over.
