A new feature of pinning the item is that I can also tag it with a reminder of what I need to do with the email such as "book flights to DCA" for my Washington DC Policy Trip. Google Inbox will automatically convert what I just typed into a direct link to Google Flights with the dates filled in from the email round-trip between where I am and where I want to go. It does this for items such as "email Joe Smith" or "booty-call Natalie Dormer" or "add this to calendar" or "create new event" and so on.
