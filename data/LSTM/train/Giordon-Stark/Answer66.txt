Furthermore  solar neutrinos oscillate between different "flavors" on their way here from the sun  a fact that confounded physicists for years. To complete the neutrino trifecta  they are the classic exhibit of parity violation for the weak interaction  a blow to physicists' mid-1950s dreams of perfect mathematical symmetry. Page on home.arcor.deWhen you see a power generator short-circuit and a beam of electricity forms between the two ends -- you'll notice that beam slowly rises. The reason it doesn't stay in a straight line (shortest path between two points) is that it ionizes and heats up the air so well that the path of least resistance is in the column of rising hot air it generates.John Wheeler believes all electrons have the same mass (and charge) because they are all the same electron (see One-electron universe).Sound can produce light.
