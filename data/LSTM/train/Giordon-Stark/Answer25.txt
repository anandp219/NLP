Thus  the unprocessed data will exist in two copies  one at CERN and one divided up around the world. Each of the Tier 1 centers will also host a complete set of the data in a compact form structured for physicists to carry out many of their analyses.The full LHC Computing Grid also has Tier 2 centers  which are smaller computing centers at universities and research institutes. Computers at these centers will supply distributed processing power to the entire grid for the data analyses. [4]The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) is composed of four levels  or Tiers  called 0  1  2 and 3.
