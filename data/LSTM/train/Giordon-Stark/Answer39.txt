The second is a 2D histogram of the jet pt versus jet mass. The histogrammed data could be stored back in a ROOT file to access in another script to draw the plots and save them to file. Because of the nature of the ROOT file  we can access histograms as fast as we want independent of the size of the ROOT file because it stores pointers to the histogram data.Now  as you start getting significantly more complicated data  and the nature of the ROOT files able to store pointers to other data  you'll find that standard databases are ill-equipped to store ROOT data in the first place.
