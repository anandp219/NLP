  You can. It's just not going to help you a lot.You can use Gauss's law for the electric dipole. What it will tell you is that [math]\oint \vec{E} \cdot \text{d}\vec{a} = 0[/math]which tells you that the net flux through any surface enclosing your charges is zero. This does not actually tell you anything about your field because we haven't solved the left-hand side. The net flux outwards through some portion of the surface balances the net flux inwards through some other portion of the surface.
