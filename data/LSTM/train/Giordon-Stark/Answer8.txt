How do I do this? Well  let's say my email was1giordon.stark@domain.tldAnd I sign up on a website using my email address  let's say  Quora. I tag my email with the website1giordon.stark+quora@domain.tldThis means I can filter specifically by the recipient email address  rather than the sender. For example  Quora sends emails from various accounts  and I rather not set up a damn filter for every single one.This also lets me figure out who is selling my account information because if YahooAnswers emails me using that email address  then I know Quora sold them my account information and I'll bitch at them about it.If I wanted to tag spam  I could do "+spam" but that seems obvious.
