Everything inside a ROOT file is binary for various computing reasons I'd rather not get into. Because of this  a program that understands how to read a ROOT file knows that all it needs to do is open it up and read the description to understand enough about it. This means that we can open and read ROOT files in O(1) time since it doesn't matter how large or small the file is  it only reads in some number of bytes to understand the structure of the file you've given it  and then contains pointers to more information if you request it.
