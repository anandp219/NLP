  None.So umm... this is one of those times I wish I had a different answer. The only way I've been learning ROOT is through example code that gets passed down to me  or asking questions to other people who use ROOT  such as my colleagues. Googling for answers often brings up lots of guides  but many of them don't really show you the right way or the easiest way  just the way they learned how to do it... which is unfortunate.It's very.. very hard to self-teach ROOT. There are so many hacks and tricks to get it to work right that it's not really worth the effort.
