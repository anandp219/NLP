Each Tier is made up of several computer centres and provides a specific set of services. Between them the tiers process  store and analyse all the data from the Large Hadron Collider(LHC).Tier 0 is the CERN Data Centre. All of the data from the LHC passes through this central hub  but it provides less than 20% of the Grid's total computing capacity. CERN is responsible for the safe keeping of the raw data (millions of digital readings from across the detectors)  and performs the first pass at reconstructing the raw data into meaningful information.
