There are lots of buffers  pipelines  Read-Out Disks  etc... all helping us move all this information through the pipelineThis is a schematic overview of what is attached to the first red dot for the Level 1 trigger. The CTP on the bottom is that red dot on the previous image I've shown you. The Level 1 calorimeter gets data from the Liquid-Argon and Tile Calorimeters of the detector  and does some specific processing such as calculating the amount of energy in various regions using a sliding-window algorithm  or doing a very crude clustering algorithm to identify regions of more energy density.
