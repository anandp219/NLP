  Recall that the canonical commutation relation is (I looked it up  I don't really remember things by name...) [math][x  p] = i\hbar[/math]Off the top of my head  I used to do the following: [math]p \langle x | p \rangle = -i \partial_x \langle x | p \rangle[/math]which only holds true given the above commutator relation (why? an exercise for you). At this point  it becomes a trivial exercise of ordinary differential equations to get to a nice form for [math]p[/math] in the [math]x[/math]-basis.
