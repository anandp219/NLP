When it hits [math]\phi = 0[/math]  the magnetic force is zero and then switches direction to be in the [math]+\hat{z}[/math]. When it turns around to go back towards [math]\phi=0[/math]  it is in the [math]-\hat{z}[/math] direction  and passing zero  it flips to be in the [math]+\hat{z}[/math] direction. It will appear to be oscillating more rapidly. When it spins counter-clockwise  it goes down until it passes through [math]\phi=0[/math] in which case it goes up. Then when it turns around and spins clockwise  it will go down again until it passes through [math]\phi=0[/math] in which case it goes up.
