The return of the GetEntry function just tells you the size of the data stored at that particular entry. To get things like actual values  you need to grab the TLeaf associated with the TBranch (it's complicated  I know  but you generally get used to it or just write macros so you never deal with actual direct features like accessing a single value). One of the locations in which ROOT shines is that you can chain multiple ROOT files together and then draw histograms and save them to files. Drawing histograms is one of the most common things we can do and can be as easy as12root [0] mytree->Draw("jet_AntiKt10LCTopo_pt")root [1] mytree->Draw("jet_AntiKt10LCTopo_pt:jet_AntiKt10LCTopo_m")the first draws a 1D histogram of the Anti-Kt R=1.0 (clustered from topological clusters in the detector) jet's pt.
