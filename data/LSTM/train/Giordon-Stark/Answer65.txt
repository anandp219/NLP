Not only does it hold the protons and neutrons together at a larger scale  but it also holds quarks together to form particles like protons and neutrons (hadrons). It has been shown to have a component proportional to the distance between objects; for example: it gets stronger the further apart two quarks are.There are about 65 billion solar neutrinos passing through one square centimeter of you  every second. Fortunately for us  neutrinos just pass right through. Unfortunately for physicists  that makes it harder to detect them.
