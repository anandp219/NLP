No  I'm not obvious. I'm sneaky like a white ninja. Like Aunt Flo  I use the period!1g.iordon.star.k@domain.tldThis way  I know for sure emails tagged with this  I NEVER care about. No matter what. This saves me a lot of hassle of creating an anonymous email because I can just filter my recipient email.What about zero inbox?Honestly  I get about 100+ emails a day. It's pretty hard for me to really go through them all  but I can easily use Google Inbox's "done" feature to quickly archive anything that I don't need to care about or just are notifications informing me of something.
