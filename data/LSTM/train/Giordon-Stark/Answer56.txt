It will appear to be bouncing up and down like a parabolic trajectory with the minimum corresponding to [math]\phi=0[/math]If the magnetic field is in the [math]\hat{z}[/math] direction  the magnetic force will be aligned parallel or antiparallel to the dipole moment. In fact  as it spins through [math]\phi=0[/math] to [math]\phi = -\pi/2[/math]  the force will point towards the negative charge (parallel to dipole moment). When it turns around back towards [math]\phi = +\pi/2[/math]  it will point towards the positive charge  antiparallel the dipole moment.
