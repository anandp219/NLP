Most Physicists in Run-1 dealt with NTUPLs and DPDs -- these are your standard ROOT files with TTrees and TBranches and TLeaves (I'll get to these later). Now  when we gear up for Run-2 we will work on DxAOD primarily which are derived (gigabytes in size) from AODs (terabytes in size) formed from the Tier-0 AODs (petabytes in size). Here's a picture highlighting the general processWhat is Tier-0 then? Computing sites?Well  Tier-0 refers to the facility at CERN that had the primary role of interacting directly with the RAW data from the detector as well as the archival of the data on magnetic tapes.The LHC grid is organized into tiers.
