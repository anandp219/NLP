For example  an Anti-Kt R=1.0 locally calibrated jet from topological clusters could be groomed with Kt  R=0.3 subjets. Rather than storing the subjet information directly under the jet  the jet stores pointers to the subjet information. This means that the same data could be pointed to by multiple sources in an effort to minimize storage space and maximize efficiency. I once tried to take a ROOT file that was 2 gigabytes and store it in a MySQL database (23 gigabytes) and a PostgreSQL database (18 gigabytes).
