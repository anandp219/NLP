  There are a few reasons... Any attack on the Kim regime would lead to massive casualties in South Korea because the North Korean army is prepared to launch massive amounts of artillery across the boarder. Also note that South Korea's capital city  Seoul  is located near the boarder  providing a target-rich environment for all of that artillery.The world watched as brutal regimes were dismantled in Afghanistan and Iraq not so long ago  and neither of those "regime changes" ended well. The Kim regime is responsible for the humanitarian crises of North Korea today.
