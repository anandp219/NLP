  Since there are no details - what is going on  what signs is he ignoring - it is impossible to answer this question with any confidence. However  as someone who is terrible at picking up hints and clues in relationships  I have to say that it is entirely possible the hints and/or clues are too subtle for him. To find out  tell him what's going on  and see how he reacts.Maybe he'll say he was surprised to learn that  and then he'll respond appropriately. Then you can more forward together.Maybe he'll express surprise  then respond inappropriately.
