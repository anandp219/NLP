  No  it isn't. The best figures we have (discarding the NRA's wildly inflated numbers) indicate that defensive gun use outnumbers criminal gun use by roughly two to one. And by "we" I mean the Institute of Medicine  which was directed by President Obama to study firearm violence in the wake of the Sandy Hook murders.But defensive gun use barely makes the weekly police blotter  whereas mass shootings are inevitably followed by a week-long media extravaganza in which the perpetrator becomes a house-hold name.
