Sexual preference and gender identity are just the latest issues to be added to the list of things that only matter to bigots.There's a common bumper-sticker that says "If you're not outraged  you're not paying attention." More people are paying attention. Over time  more and more younger people have steadily recognized that it makes no sense to persecute people based on these arbitrary factors. And  at the risk of sounding morbid  older people who thought that such discrimination was acceptable or even beneficial have been steadily dying off.If the "obsession" is greater today than in the past  it is simply because the problems have been studied  discussed  and broadcast to society-at-large more effectively than ever before.
