This has given many people a very distorted view of firearm use.One could argue just as convincingly that our culture's insistence on making mass murderers into celebrities is a mental illness. There is evidence that mass murder is contagious - mentally unstable people are inspired to kill by the fame that our culture has unfailingly bestowed upon the mass murderers who came before them.Firearm violence  like most forms of violence  has dropped almost by half in the last 20 years. One form of violence that has not declined is the form that guarantees its perpetrators celebrity status and national name recognition.Yet despite the decades-long drop in firearm violence  and the more-frequent use of firearms for self-defense  many people believe that gun violence is an increasing problem  and that guns are have no purpose other than murder.
