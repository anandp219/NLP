  Take a course that teaches when lethal force is and is not acceptable  and how to behave in a lethal-force situation.In my area there are courses named "General Defensive Handgun" offered by a couple of different schools - I haven't looked into where that term came from but I suspect it's a standard of some sort. They cover safe handling and shooting technique  but most of the class time was spent on legal questions and how to distinguish yourself from a murderer (in the eyes of police and bystanders) should you be forced to shoot.Time spent practicing at the range won't teach you this stuff.
