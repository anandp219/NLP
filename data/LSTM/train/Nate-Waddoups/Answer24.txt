The NRA is just the mouthpiece.The "gun free society" advocates are just as much to blame for this deadlock as the NRA is. Perhaps moreso - the NRA's "extreme" positions are a rational response to an organized attempt to outlaw firearm ownership.I do think background checks are a good idea when a firearm changes ownership. But I understand why so many firearm owners are reluctant to support legislation proposed by people whose stated goal is  in this author's words "a gun-free society."
