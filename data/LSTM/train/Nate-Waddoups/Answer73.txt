  Since you mentioned in a comment that you have no trouble with 2D stuff...2D diagrams are often indispensable for communication at work  but 3D stuff  or even drawings of 3D stuff  has been very rare in my career.I think you'll be fine in the workplace. Prerequisite classes might be tricky but maybe your school will work with you on that.Calculus for example will teach some useful concepts... Most of what I remember from my classes was in 2D but there was a little bit of 3D stuff. It wasn't essential though  it's just so closely related that it makes sense for classes to go there after showing some things in 2D.
