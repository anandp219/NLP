  No. We know quite a bit about how X and Y chromosomes produce male and female genitalia  but we don't know nearly enough about what causes a person's brain to identify as male or female. It is entirely possible that people with gender dysphoria have brains that have perfectly sound biological reasons for identifying as a gender other than what their chromosomes would typically lead to.Not to mention people whose bodies have clearly developed in a way that doesn't exactly match one end of the male-female spectrum or the other  or people whose chromosome's aren't simply XX or XY.Just because most people's minds do match their genitalia  doesn't mean that everyone's should match.
