  There is no reason to think that grays are unique. Note that Dr Pepperberg didn't choose a gray for her research - she got Alex as a pet first  then figured that it would be interesting to see how much Alex could learn.A mutual acquaintance told me that Dr Pepperberg said she suspects that macaws might be able to learn more  or learn faster (I forgot which)  but she also said that there's no way to know for sure without another research effort similar to the one that Alex was in. The training that Alex received was unique in scope and quantity  and as a result of that uniqueness we can only guess at how well it would work with other species.
