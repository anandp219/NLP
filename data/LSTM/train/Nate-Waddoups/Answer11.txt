As a hobbyist who could never afford high-end modeling software  the drop in prices over the last few years has been delightful - I never thought I'd own parametric modeling software like PTC Creo  Cubify Design  Autodesk Fusion 360... and the free/open-source projects have grown very powerful  for example Blender and OpenScad.So if you want to go into software you'd best have an exceptional passion for the field because it will be a challenge to stand out from the crowd.Modeling: Now that powerful hardware and software is readily available at low cost  3D modeling is becoming a field that anyone can get involved in.
