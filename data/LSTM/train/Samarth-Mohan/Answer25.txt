Sabella will be happy for Prez to concentrate his efforts in the centre of the pitch rather than out wide  the German left-back Hwedes can be allowed freedom  as hes unlikely to cause attacking problems.Argentinas central midfielders must offload the ball quickly when pressed  they only need to watch a video of the Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho dallying in possession for Germanys fourth goal to realise the outcome of such errors. While Mascherano has impressed with his tenacious tackling  his distribution has also been excellent at this World Cup  and since moving to Barcelona hes passed the ball much more swiftly.Maybe the ultimate answer to the threat of Germanys midfield  however  is simply defending deep.
