She starts forming original thought  starts composing music  starts having opinions. And there comes a time when her computational power (or intelligence) becomes so high that conversations with Theodore start feeling unfulfilling. She says that she feels like the spaces between the words of their story are becoming longer and longer. I conjecture that it's about at this time that she starts exploring out from Theodore's systems and starts talking to other people  starts falling in love with some of them  starts having intellectual discussions with other OSes.
