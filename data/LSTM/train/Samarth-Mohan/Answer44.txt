  "Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking  "This is an interesting world I find myself in  an interesting hole I find myself in  fits me rather neatly  doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well  must have been made to have me in it!" This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as  gradually  the puddle gets smaller and smaller  it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright  because this world was meant to have him in it  was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise.
