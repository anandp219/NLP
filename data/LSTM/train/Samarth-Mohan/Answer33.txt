  I would kill to have been born in the 1920s / 30s. This is mostly because I love jazz music and this would let me experience the music of the roaring  decadent 20s  and the rise of mainstream jazz over the next couple of decades.I would kill to be able to spend an evening in a smoke-filled  underground jazz club  sipping on bootleg whiskey and listening to these songs.Obligatory video of favourites:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Chet Baker  But Not For Mehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Coltrane  Naimahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Mingus  Moanin'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Coltrane  Blue Train
