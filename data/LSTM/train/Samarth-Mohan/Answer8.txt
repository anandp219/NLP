  I'm a big fan of Amelie. This film is entirely about the human imagination and it's effect on our perceptions of reality. The movie follows the eponymous Amelie as she uses her imagination in her quest to affect changes in the lives of characters around her.Amelie helps her landlady  mourning the death of her lover and stuck with the memory of his indiscretions  move on by writing a fake letter of apology. The landlady's outlook was confined by her knowledge of the affair  making it difficult for her to move on and in helping her  Amelie uses her own imagination to stretch the boundary of her's.In a similar vein  she sends her father's garden gnome on a trip around the world  when he is obsessed completely by the idea to finish the memorial to his dead wife  even at the expense of his own dreams.
