The father finds it difficult to understand and interpret the photographs with his limited imagination. However  Amelies eventually makes headway in changing her father's limited imaginations though her repeated attempts. And by the end of the film  he manages to leave the house on a journey to discover other ways to make his life fulfilling. Again  the film conveys how imagination can set boundaries on an individuals sense of the possible.Amelie also helps the jealous ex-boyfriend Joseph and hypochondriac Georgette get back together simply by helping them open their imaginations up by a misdirected reinterpretation of each other's actions  thereby attaching value to their otherwise mundane activities (sitting in the corner of the cafe everyday and hypochondria respectively).
