First  they need a good individual performance from Schweinsteiger  handed the most difficult task of his career: stopping the most celebrated player of his generation performing on the worlds biggest stage.More crucially  they need a good team effort. This means the second task must be to remain extremely compact  denying Messi space between the lines  and getting bodies around him if he manages to evade Schweinsteiger.Third  they must attempt to prevent the service into him. Kroos and Khedira pressed Brazils deep midfielders excellently in the staggering 7-1 semi-final victory over the hosts  and theyll look to shut down Javier Mascherano and Lucas Biglia similarly.Germany's Bastian Schweinsteiger will be key to stopping Lionel Messi.
