Germany dont depend upon counter-attacking as much as in 2010  but their most dangerous attacks against Brazil were quick  direct and about breaking into space. When Argentina get numbers behind the ball  theyre extremely solid  and theyre yet to concede a goal in the knockout stage of this competition. Rather than trying to compete in midfield  Sabella might allow Germany the run of that zone  and keep it tight much deeper.Argentina will be determined not to be pressed into submission by Germany's midfield.
