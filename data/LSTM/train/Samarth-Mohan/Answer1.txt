  Because the community incentivizes these content creators  you'll often see poorly argued answers  throwaway answers  really-should-have-been-comments etc. being upvoted highly. On Quora  you're not supposed to upvote something you "like" or downvote something you don't. Upvotes and downvotes have a very very specific purpose on this site [1]  and there are guidelines that ideally ought to be followed.It's up to us to make new users conform to the existing quality of answers on the site. And we can do that by voting responsibly.
