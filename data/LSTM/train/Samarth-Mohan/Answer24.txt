This will be extremely tough for Argentina  who arent blessed with great passers in the centre of the pitch  especially with one day less rest.Alejandro Sabella is likely to continue with Enzo Prez on one flank  probably the right  in place of the injured ngel di Mara. The Benfica winger isnt anything like a natural replacement  however  and more of a central midfielder  hell tuck inside and play alongside Javier Mascherano and Lucas Biglia  with Argentina hoping to win the midfield battle with quantity  rather than quality.
