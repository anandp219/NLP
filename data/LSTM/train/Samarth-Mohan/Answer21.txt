  I just came across a fantastic piece on The Guardian by Michael Cox on the same topic.Original article: Germany defence and Argentina midfield key to World Cup final chancesAuthor's Website: World Cup 2014 analysisAuthor's Twitter: Michael Cox (Zonal_Marking) on TwitterHow do Germany stop Messi?Germany kept Lionel Messi quiet in their 4-0 thrashing of Argentina in the 2010 quarter-final  but it will be a tougher task this time around. Messi is now more comfortable in that classic Argentinian No10 role  and has shown patience and guile when receiving the ball in deeper positions.The man tasked with stopping Messi will be Bastian Schweinsteiger  who has played the deep-lying midfield role since Joachim Lw reformatted his side for the 1-0 quarter-final victory over France.
