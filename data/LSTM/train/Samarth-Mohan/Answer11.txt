  Hi Anon Please stop  relax and take a deep breath. First off  congratulations for knowing what you want to do  and being so motivated to achieve it. Most other people at your age have other (let's say  less intellectual) pursuits.Keep breathing.If you're talking about biological advantages that a boy might have  please don't worry too much  because there are so many other factors and variables at play (rich vs poor kids  kids from abusive families vs supportive families  kids from villages with little or no access to preparatory material etc) that being a woman does not pose a grave systemic disadvantage for you.Still breathing  yes?Now  to get to how you can do well in the exams  practice  practice and MORE practice.
