Even without a single Muslim vote  Congress and UPA would have clearly outperformed BJP and NDA by a huge margin.There are multiple other trends to be seen. Sure  Muslims did not vote much for NDA - but neither did SCs who form a much bigger chunk of the population. STs mostly voted for UPA as well. On the other hand  most of the upper caste votes ended up with NDA. UPA had near-universal approval  with at least a quarter or more votes from all groups but one. Why are these trends never under scrutiny and only Muslims have to answer every time that BJP loses/Congress wins?Even when AAP won in Delhi this time  there were people claiming that Muslims were behind it.
