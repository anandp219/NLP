This is truly the highest level of the competition  the competitive programming equivalent of the Olympics. If the best that India can offer can only do so well (the best Indian team this year ranked 69)  it is plainly unfair to blame a team on what is a national problem.Why does India do so badly on such contests? This question would need a long answer. To summarise  competitive programming in India is still a very young and narrow field  and students are rarely encouraged and motivated to follow it.
