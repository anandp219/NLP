This can be used to factorise the numbers efficiently. For the primes [math]p_i[/math] which are found  keep a list [math]e(p_i)[][/math] which stores the prime powers as above.For each [math]A_i[/math]  find its prime factorisation [math]p_1^{q_1} p_2^{q_2} \ldots p_k^{q_k}[/math]. For each such [math]p_i[/math]  add [math]q_i[/math] to the list [math]e(p_i)[/math]. After all the [math]N[/math] numbers have been processed  use the procedure above for each prime to find the gcd product. The product of the gcd products of all primes gives the required answer.ExampleSuppose the array is [math]1 2 3 \ldots10[/math].
