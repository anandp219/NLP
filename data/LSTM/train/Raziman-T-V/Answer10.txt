You are not being forced to eat beef  and you are not being forbidden from any ritual involving the cow or otherwise. When you are able to live in exactly the same way as you would if others did not eat beef  how are they being intolerant?One analogy I can think of would be alcohol/pork. These items are forbidden for Muslims. Should they be banned by law  or should non-Muslims give up these items voluntarily to not offend Muslims? Or think interfaith marriages. According to Islamic law  Muslims are not allowed to marry Hindus.
