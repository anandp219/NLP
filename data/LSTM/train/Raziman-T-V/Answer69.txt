  Use linearity of expectation.We are essentially asked the following problem:You are given N objects [math]0 \ldots N-1[/math] with specified weights [math]w_i[/math]. At each step  you pick an object out of the remaining ones with probability proportional to its weight and discard it. How many steps will it be before object 0 is picked?To solve this  find this first : What is the probability that object i is chosen before object 0? This is clearly [math]\frac{w_i}{w_0+w_i}[/math] since the other objects don't matter while deciding the relative ordering between object 0 and object i.Using linearity of expectation  the expected total number of objects picked before object 0 is just the sum of probabilities of picking each of them before object 0.
