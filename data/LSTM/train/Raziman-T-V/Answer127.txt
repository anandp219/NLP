We have not yet achieved replacement fertility yet  but we are getting there as well. If you would not use the binary logic and ask for such programmes to be scrapped  why the hurry in ending only reservations?In fact  the reservation policy is showing slow success. Reservation policy has started to improve the lives of SC/STs. They are starting to get adequate representation in the lowest levels of employment. Let it continue for a few more generations so that they can attain vertical mobility and achieve proportional representation in all levels of employment and get to enough positions of power so that discrimination is reduced.
