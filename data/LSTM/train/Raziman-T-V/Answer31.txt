Abhimanyu  Pratik and I threw everything we could at the problemset  but ended up close to the bottom of the table. We had a particularly bad day  as we should have been able to solve 3-4 problems with our knowledge and might have ended up closer to the middle of the table on an average day.Everyone has such bad days. I have seen my very bright students end up without a medal at the IOI. I am quite sure that the Delhi team would have done far better on their average day. They did not get to the World Finals through a lottery  they did very well in the Indian regionals and got their deserved place to represent India and their college at the World Finals.
