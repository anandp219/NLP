Men are afraid of not only losing their privilege but also worried about the women they were "entrusted with". On the other hand  women have to constantly confront breaking their tradition and religion  and also worry about the consequences of losing the "protected" status - the backlash for violating the social status quo can be serious and violent. As a result  feminism is caricatured and misrepresented as extreme  and both men and women are afraid of identifying with it.The number of women in our parliaments and slate legislatures is abysmal [3].
