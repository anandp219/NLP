At northern latitudes  this means that the tip of the shadow of the sundial moves clockwise. When people from the northern hemisphere invented watches  the hands were made to follow the direction of the sundials. This is why we have clocks which move clockwise. However  in the southern hemisphere  the motion of the shadow is reversed.Sundial at Perth  Australia [3]. Note how the hour markings are anticlockwise.Things would have been different if clocks were invented in the southern hemisphere. We would have had a different definition for clockwise!Notes:[1] There would be small seasonal corrections due to the ellipticity of the earth's orbit.
