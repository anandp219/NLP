The crosses  known as diffraction spikes  are caused by the lights path being disturbed slightly as it passes by the cross-shaped struts that support the telescopes secondary mirror. It is only noticeable for bright objects where a lot of light is concentrated on one spot  such as stars. Darker  more spread-out objects like nebulae or galaxies do not show visible levels of this distortion.If you look closely  you can see that the lines emanating from the stars in the four directions are not of uniform intensity but show intensity oscillations typical of diffraction.Sources[1] Source: Wikimedia Commons.
