In many cases  we can express the polarisation as a power series in the electric field. The first term in the series after the linear one is usually quadratic  and it results in scattering at twice the frequency of incident light  which is known as second harmonic generation (SHG).Now  these nonlinear effects are highly dependent on symmetry. For example  in crystals which show centrosymmetry  there can be no second harmonic generation from the bulk of the material but only from the surface. Thus we usually differentiate between bulk SHG and surface SHG.
