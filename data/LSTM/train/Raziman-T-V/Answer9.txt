  Let me turn the question on its head:Muslims  Christians  Dalits and Keralites eat beef. Hindus consider the cow sacred and worship her. The first group is tolerant enough to let the second group do as they please. Why can't the second group return the favour and show this tiny amount of tolerance?It all depends on what you consider as tolerance. For me  tolerance is about letting others follow their way of life - not about changing your own habits. When X and Y - people of different religions - live together X not allowing Y to follow their religious practices is intoleranceX letting Y follow their religious practices is toleranceX changing their personal habits to suit Y is unnecessaryNon-Hindus giving up beef would fall under the third category.Ask yourself the question : Does someone else eating beef affect your personal practice of religion in any way?
