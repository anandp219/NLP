Having a decent meal in either of these places should cost you under 10 CHF.Since you are a student  you might be lucky if your campus has decent restaurants. EPFL for example has half a dozen restaurants where you can have a very good meal for 8 CHF. The meals are usually balanced as well as tasty  and having so many restaurants on campus with multiple items on the menu guarantees sufficient variety.The cheapest and healthiest option  of course  is to cook for yourself. Buy raw materials from the nearest Migros.
