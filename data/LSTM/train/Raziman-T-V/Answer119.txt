Some women cover their heads with shawls or ends of their sarees. Some keep pinned headscarves  some others wear the purdah without covering their face. Then there are some who cover their face too  and some who go so far as to cover their eyes with nets. The proportions of who does what varies from region to region  showing that this is not a monolithic Islamic custom but one with serious regional influence. In Kerala  for example  I am yet to see a woman who covers her face. My mother wears a headscarf and saree when she goes to teach in school or for other public functions  but she wears a Purdah without face covering when she goes to the mosque.
