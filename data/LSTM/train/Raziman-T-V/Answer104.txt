But vertex C in the graph on the left has degree two  whereas in the one on the right it has degree zero. Thus the solution is not unique in general  and we cannot find it just from the other values.But it turns out that in this particular case  we can indeed find the degree of the missing vertex. This is because the graph of blocks and streets is bipartite. Colour the blocks black and white alternately  as in a chessboard. Every street then connects a black block and a white block. That is  the total number of streets ending on black blocks has to be equal to the number ending on white blocks.
