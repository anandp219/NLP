This is equal to the sum of [math]A(u w) A^k(w v)[/math]. Since [math]A(u w)[/math] is non-zero and equal to one for precisely the neighbours of w  this expression is equal to the total number of paths between v and the neighbours of u with length k. But every such path corresponds to a u-v path of length k+1 since each such path consists of an edge from u to its neighbour  followed by any k length path from the neighbour to v. We have thus proved the inductive step.Finally  note that the matrix exponentiation has to be performed using exponentiation by squaring to reduce the number of matrix multiplications needed from O(k) to O(log k).
