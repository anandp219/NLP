Saying that a certain religious practice affects the society negatively could be a controversial thing  but Quora is not going to kick you out for that. But Claiming that a certain group of people are lesser humans and deserve fewer rights is not a mere controversial belief  your proclaiming it on Quora alienates other contributors and makes their Quora experience significantly worse. The moment you stop talking ideas and start attacking people  you are not making Quora a better place.And Quora does not take those things lightly.
