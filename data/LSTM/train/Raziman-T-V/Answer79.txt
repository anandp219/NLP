  The solution is to use the following VLC-specific settings (You can find them under "Playback Control" on VLC help):123456--start-time <float> Start time The stream will start at this position (in seconds).--stop-time <float> Stop time The stream will stop at this position (in seconds).--run-time <float> Run time The stream will run this duration (in seconds).These parameters can be included in the track description in the playlist (.xspf format) file. The trick is to add them under the tag <extension application="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/playlist/0">.
