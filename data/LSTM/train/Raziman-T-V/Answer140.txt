It is called computational physics  look it up.R11 : It is still nice. You get to play with computers all day? It is so bad to have only one hour of computer science in school. I have to share a computer with two other students  I am allowed to play games only once in a term  and now I have to learn programming too - it is so hard.R25 : Well  it gets quite boring to play with computers all day. You will be doing a lot of programming  so pay attention to that. And don't worry about the computers at school.
