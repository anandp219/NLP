  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.First  define our DP function as best(i j) = minimum distance sum for the first i villages on placing j post offices such that there is a post office at village i.Let us see how we can compute best(). We will start with the base case best(i 1). This means that all villages from 1 to i have to be assigned to post office at i. Thus we have123456best(* 1)=0for i=1 to N for j=1 to i best(i 1)+=dist(i j) endendHere  dist(i j) is just the distance between villages i and j.Next let us look at the recurrence for best(i j) for j>1.
