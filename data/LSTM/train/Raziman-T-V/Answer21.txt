Similarly  the Muslims who voted against Congress would be feeling bad. I am going to wager that educated Muslims are going to be way more pissed about the claims floating around that Congress won on Muslim vote bank than on the fate of their own vote.Personally  I kind of feel relieved when Congress wins at the national level. As much as I hate their corruption and dynasty rule  they are the lesser evil with a chance at the national level. I disagree with both the social and economic policies of NDA.
