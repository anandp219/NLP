  The (u v) th element of the k th power of the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph gives the number of paths of length k between u and v.This is easily proved by induction. The case k=0 is straightforward. The k th power of the adjacency matrix A is just the identity matrix  and the number of 0 length paths between u and v is 1 iff u=v and 0 otherwise. Alternately  you can take k=1 as the base case and note that the number of 1 length paths between u and v is given by the (u v) th element of A.Now  consider the (u v) th element of [math]A^{k+1}[/math].
