  Less than a Giganewton.Back of the envelope order-of-magnitude estimation time.The power that the earth receives from the sun is of the order of S = 1 kW/m^2. Radiation pressure exerted on a surface is the incident power divided by the velocity of light c [1]. The total force that is exerted on the surface can thus be found by multiplying the solar constant by the effective area of the earth A and dividing by c.F = S A / c= (1 kW/m)  (  (6  10 m)) / (3  10 m/s) [2]~ 10 - 10 NHow big is this force?
