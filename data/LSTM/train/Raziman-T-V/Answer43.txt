  Most Indian Muslims have not read Bhagavad Gita.Many of them would have come across the more famous verses  but very few would have read it from beginning to end. I will go ahead and say that most Indian Muslims have not even read the Quran with the meaning from beginning to end  rather than merely reciting it in Arabic.Religion is mostly transferred from generation to generation rather than chosen personally. Most Indians are Hindus and Muslims and Christians simply because their parents were too and brought them up with the same religion.
