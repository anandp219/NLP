Real tolerance would be accepting that it means different things to different people. As much as it is an object of worship for you  it is a source of milk and meat for me. Tomorrow  if a more extremist group comes along and tells you that the cow is so holy to them that you should not milk it  would you give in to them in the name of tolerance? If that seems absurd  understand that the demand of stopping eating the cow sounds the same to beef-eaters.Whether I eat beef or not  you get to live the same way.
