The complexity of this recurrence to fill the win(i j k) table is O(N).Can we do better?Yes. the important thing to note is that the players to the left and right of i are independent. Since they do not "talk" to each other  everything to the right can be finished off before the left  or vice versa. This suggests that we can split our win function into two:rightwin(i k) = 1 iff i could have emerged as the survivor after battles involving only players in the clockwise range from i to kleftwin (i j) = 1 iff i could have emerged as the survivor after battles involving only players in the anticlockwise range from i to jIt is easy to see that win(i j k) = leftwin(i j) AND rightwin(i k).The recurrence for rightwin(i k) is essentially the same as beforerightwin(i k) = 1IFFthere exist i'  k' : i<k'i'k and rightwin(i k'-1)=1 and leftwin(i' k')=1 and rightwin(i' k)=1 and i defeats i' The leftwin recurrence is symmetric.
