Look at the list of highest-grossing Bollywood films. Of the top 25 grossing films  only two (Dhoom 3 and My Name Is Khan) have the main star portraying Muslim characters. I bet that you can do a similar analysis with the list of Bollywood films of 2014 and find that barely 10% of all reasonable-budget films are made centered on the Muslim society (Muslims do get a lot of representation in Bollywood films as antagonists). The "Muslim social" has pretty much died. When only one in ten of films are made about Muslims  isn't it only fair that only one in ten of films criticising religion are about Islam?The second reason is that some of the biggest problems with Islam are not pertinent in the Indian context.
