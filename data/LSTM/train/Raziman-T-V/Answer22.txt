There might be better parties at the state level in various states  but none of them have the critical mass for the whole of India.Finally How can BJP get Muslims to vote for them?This is kind of going to be hard. The first thing they have to do is kick some nutcases out of their party. People like Sakshi Maharaj and Yogi Adityanath make at least one statement every week which translates to "Don't vote for us" for non-Hindus. They spew venom and continue to keep positions in the government. If BJP deals with these folks seriously  people are going to take note.Go easy on the saffronisation of everything.
