It is relatively easy to bump the GDP by going top heavy. But there are millions of Indians at the lowest economic strata who have not been too well served by the governments till now. These people are composed of a disproportionately high number of SC/STs and Muslims. By coming up with policies that improve the status of these groups  you have a good chance of getting their votes - and that would mean a lot of Muslim votes.Heck  if you do all this  I will vote for you. Of course  if you do all this and manage to gain some Muslim votes  you might lose the support of hardliners who voted for you only to teach Muslims a lesson.
