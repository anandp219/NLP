  The claim that no two bags are alike is clearly false.Let us say there are between 50 and 60 pieces in a Skittles bag. The number of different bags containing N pieces of 5 colours is given by the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation. [math] x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = N [/math]Here  [math]x_i[/math] is the number of pieces of colour [math]i[/math] in the box. Now  the number of solutions to this equation is just [math]^{N+4}C_4[/math]. Considering the possible values of N from 50 to 60  we get the total number of different bags as just over 5 million.
