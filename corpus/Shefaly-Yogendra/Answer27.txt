 What a fascinating question! As an expat, I have often thought about the matter and tried to find people who have experienced statelessness. There are several possibilities. The country of which one is a citizen may withdraw the nationality from the person. The most recent and high profile case is Edward Snowden whose passport was revoked leaving him stateless. The country of which one is a citizen ceases to exist when one is outside it. This happened to many in 1971 when Bangladesh was formed and overnight many citizens of then-East Pakistan found themselves stateless while in other countries. This was temporary. The country may require blood ties for citizenship. Brunei famously has many stateless persons living in Brunei. This is also true of children born of non-Chinese residents of Hong Kong though such children can get their parents' citizenship and the statelessness issue only comes up during cross border adoption. Some sovereign nations may recognise the statehood of your country, others may not. Case in point is Palestine. Palestinians also have refused Israeli citizenship in large numbers, thus effectively remaining stateless.A citizen may renounce his or her citizenship e.g. which is permissible by law in the United States.EDIT while I was writing the answer, the question was edited to add "at birth" but I will leave my answer here.
