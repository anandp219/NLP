 In an older answer I have written something that may address part of your question. Shefaly Yogendra's answer to Why do people not care about anything unless it involves them?The longer explanation I am afraid lies in trying to figure out why Indian society looks down upon the weak, the poor, the elderly. We are dominantly a hugely hierarchy driven society -- think caste, as an example. Combine that thinking with the human disposition to classify things quickly, often in a reductive manner, so as to derive some sort of heuristic to deal with the person we are dealing with. Then mix it vigorously with a widely held and internalised belief in the cycle of birth and death, and the form of life/ quality of life being an outcome of the previous birth's actions.The result is a society that despises, hides, discards its disabled. They are deemed inferior, with their disability - stupidly enough - attributed to bad kismet or sins of the last birth or some equally indefensible idea. Is that wise? Of course not. It could happen to any of us -- an idea we don't entertain at all as I wrote in my answer linked above. It is also beyond foolish to waste so much valuable human capital. But that is what we are - short sighted, fallacious thinking, blinker wearing, smug people of small minds.Kritika Gupta has already written a heartwarming answer for your question details. I just wanted to address the top line question. You are the person who knows her life best and you have access to us all. Draw upon your self and us, and live as fulsomely as you can.
