 The word "friend" on social media means something totally different from what it might mean to people in real life. Businesses, especially new or startup businesses, do well to "friend" (yes, verb form) early adopters and commenters even if the latter aren't exactly fans. That gives them valuable feedback and the possibility of future conversion to a customer. This could be an explanation of the friend request from the CEO of the company. Only very few however have mastered the art of staying in the conversation and engaging with empathy and an open mind, which may explain why not much has happened after the friend request.
