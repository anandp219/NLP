 Much has been written about Madonna's fitness habits. They are a mix of diet, exercise and healthy mind habits, underscored by serious discipline. It must be emphasised that her fitness today is an outcome of years of dedicated practice and commitment, and not something she started doing now. Here is a set of things:1. Diet: In a CNN interview, Madonna spoke about her macrobiotic diet which focuses on vegetables, salad, whole grains and fish. She also reportedly has a Japanese chef who incorporates sea weed and other Japanese ingredients in her diet. He has recently written a book about his style of cooking. 2. Exercise:Madonna has also publicly spoken of her committed practice of Ashtanga Yoga and Pilates, in addition to cardio sessions. Her one time trainer Tracey Anderson was known for dance cardio and small muscle based workouts. The picture isn't gratuitously included -- this is something only accomplished Yoga practitioners can manage, and showcases an amazing degree of flexibility and mobility in the body. 3. Mind and spirituality: Born and raised Catholic, Madonna has had some controversial lyrics that challenge Catholic beliefs. She has most recently been known for her exploring Kabbalah, a belief system of Jewish mysticism. She has also reportedly been curious about Opus Dei. One could pooh-pooh it but the quest for centering the self and a spiritual anchor can be itself quite rewarding, as recent research has been showing.
