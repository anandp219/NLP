 I don't believe there is, in a corporate customer service context, any completely unscripted interaction. There is at best a scripted-unscripted-scripted sandwich, and I would posit, there too is a degree of scripting in the middle layer especially when CSAs are trained. An unscripted conversation may work well when the customer is looking for a customised solution such as advice on a personalised gift for someone, or travel planning. The CSA needs skills to be able to define and fine-tune the customer's actual need, often advise on budgeting and then help formulate a budget, understand preferences and boundary conditions, and then confirm it all. An unscripted conversation may also work well when it is a prelude to a more scripted chat such as in private banking for UHNWIs (ultra high net worth individuals), where high trust is needed. Trust cannot be scripted into relationships but it can definitely be broken by poor unscripted chatter. An unscripted conversation also could work well when it appears more unscripted than it is. All small talk in art galleries would fall under this categorisation. This is however a specialised area of work, which brings me to the next point. An unscripted conversation may work in a highly specialised environment where the vendor definitely knows more than the customer, and the latter is relying on some of that knowledge while holding the purse strings. Style consulting and personal shopping may fit here as examples.
