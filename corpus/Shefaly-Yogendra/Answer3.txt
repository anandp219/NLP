 It is the nature of death in its finality that any emotional consequences are for those, who are related to or otherwise mourning the deceased. But while we are alive, our own wishes, feelings and emotions take precedence. So if the assisted death option is chosen by a person in pain, who is nonetheless compos mentis** then that person's wishes take priority. The living he or she leaves behind can seek solace in philosophy, religion, counselling or the circle of life depending on their preferences.**Ensuring a decision that wasn't forced on the patient is one of the largest legal and ethical conundrums in assisted dying related discourse. With good reason.
