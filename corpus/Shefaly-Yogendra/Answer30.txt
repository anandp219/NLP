 I once had occasion to bring a 70+ year old relative, who is still a practising criminal lawyer, into the tech/ online world. He used to carry case files -- all paper -- with him every day to and fro the courts. The weight bothered him and worried his wife. These cases are available online but he didn't know how to get to that. I started with helping him buy a laptop. He didn't know the hardware buttons or the keyboard, or what the ports did. We then progressed to using office software. And soon enough there was his turn to experience the web, complete with an education on viruses, malicious mails, pop up ads, ads that follow us around, ad blockers and such dubious delights. Using the web fruitfully and constructively was his main aim, to aid his work as well as to keep up to date with the news etc in his office. It took four days of intense studying, quizzing, reviewing, "homework", more reviewing to get to a point where one afternoon, he called out to me and said: "Look who is here!". His granddaughters, who live across the country from him, were on video chat with him. They were laughing and giggling, and the girls were showing him new books and telling him stories. The joy was palpable. His work, of course, continues apace but his ability to "see" his granddaughters in real time and regularly has made it all worthwhile for him. And as his "teacher", for me.
