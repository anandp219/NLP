 The one thing that youthism around us does not enable us to do is accept that at 40, in most developed nations and well-off families, we aren't even half way through our lives. Accepting and understanding that would be the first thing I would recommend, since you ask. It redefines how we see time - a shift from the scarcity mindset to a plenty mindset. Related to that, in the next year, assess your fitness and ask yourself if this body will last you forty or fifty more years. Assess for stamina, balance, flexibility, strength and disease-free-ness as it were. If the answer is "no", the next recommended accomplishment should be to build a habit of exercise and healthy eating, that will ensure that things you couldn't do by the time you were 40 you can do in your 50s or 60s and more. Further, I would recommend becoming deeply self-aware. What makes you tick, what ticks you off, how you relate, how you negotiate, what are your values, how strong is your willpower, what will not matter if it goes away tomorrow. Deep self-awareness enables the cutting out of meaning-free activities, which are easier to phase out over a year, and of course, you can tick them off your list as you go. If you can build a positive and optimistic attitude, and your body is fit, you will look back in a few years on this question and wonder why you wanted to cram everything into one year. In other words, a purposive life makes checklist living unnecessary. Lay the foundation for enjoying more than half of your life that lies ahead, unexplored! All the best.
