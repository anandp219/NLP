 Because it is not a magical silver bullet and may not always lead to significant weight loss, and it comes with additional risks of surgery related complications and early death. Why might it not be a magic bullet? Because weight management is complicated -- much more than the easy verbiage around "eat less, move more" may have us believe. The molecular regulation of appetite is mediated by several hormones all of which are correlated with weight, stress and genetics. Contrary to what we think a large person actually needs more calories to just sustain than a leaner person of the same height, age, gender may need for the same level of activity. Morbidly obese persons do not get there overnight. Nor is their life an easy passage as they face institutionalised discrimination from healthcare providers and society alike. The answers here are eye watering What is it like to be morbidly obese (BMI > 40)? For more on institutionalised discrimination, you may want to read Shefaly Yogendra's answer to Do you think obese people should be treated with equal legal rights as disabled people as the EU has just announced?In an earlier answer to Shefaly Yogendra's answer to What should I know about getting gastric bypass surgery before I commit? I had written about what goes into making an informed decision about bariatric surgery: Picking the surgeonThe consulting surgeon should want to get to know you as a patient so he or she can advise you on whether surgery is the best option for you (there are lowness cutoffs for BMI at which surgery is not the option); this may lead to a revenue loss for the surgeon, but we are looking for a robust ethical compass and commitment, instead of a 10-min consultation with the cynical view that weight loss may not be permanentThe surgeon should be willing to advise you on the risks and your own commitments post-surgery for optimal weight loss The surgeon should not hesitate to advise you to get counselling or any other help you may need to be fully mentally prepared before surgeryThe surgeon should be willing to share with you his or her record of such surgeries, success rates (% weight loss, over what time, weight kept off), failure and complication rates a(deaths, failure to lose weight etc) Where possible, client testimonials should be made available too so you can talk to past patientsThe surgeon should have a follow-up plan to check how you are doing after the surgery; such a plan may need regular discussions and meetings to see if you are coping and if you have problems resulting. Understanding the riskYou need to understand fully short and long term risks of such surgeryIf you are in doubt, your surgeon should be able to explain and clarify various probabilities and what the risk profile of your specific case may beYou may need to be comfortable discussing the minuscule but finite risk of death in such surgeries (sorry!)Understanding your responsibilities for the outcome & your commitmentSuccess in losing and keeping weight off will require you to make and stick to the dramatic changes in food intake that the surgery will necessitateYou may need to identify and establish your support systems (which may be friends, family, therapists, or other supporting people) and discuss how you will ensure they help you keep your weight loss and recovery on plan (plenty of people will not understand the drastic changes you will need to make and you may love them but they are not going to help you post-surgery and may risk your health without understanding the challenges). Insurance covering or not covering the surgery is but a minor influence on the decision which must be made by the obese person and his/ her surgeon as well as his/ her post operative care and support team.
