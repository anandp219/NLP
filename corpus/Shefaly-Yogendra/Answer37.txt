 A friend of mine went from a Philosophy and English literature degree, straight to work in investment banking. He was about 21, not sure what he wanted to do and the investment bank, hiring at his top notch university, didn't think philosophy a hindrance to investment banking. Several years later, he told me he found his ability to abstract things quickly very helpful in understanding concepts and agendas behind specific decisions and actions, but he also couldn't shake the feeling that there wasn't much meaning or value being created from his work. Your relative with some grounding in economic and history may find that training similarly useful although he/ she may be unable to avoid or ignore the deeper things that will gnaw at him/ her. That isn't a bad thing necessarily. Nearly all employers conduct induction training which gives new hires basic tools to become productive at their immediate jobs, and newer skills may be learnt on the job or through formal training, as one goes on. So the liberal arts degree or the absence of formal business credits may not be a huge challenge.
