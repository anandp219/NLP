 A business plan is the superset of data about your business - encompassing the business model, your financial projections, and all other details about customer outreach, customer service, operations. A pitch deck is a presentation/ deck of slides that one brings to potential investors. The pitch deck is an effective summary of the key items in the business plan, and includes details about what you intend doing with the funds you are asking the investor for. An elevator pitch is a succinct, really brief description that answers "so, what do you do?". The idea is that someone asks you the question in the elevator and since you don't know how long you have got and whether the asker is getting off at the next floor, you get to give this succinct pitch and with luck, it is a conversation starter! So the same content, with decreasing order of detail, but sharper focus on the most essential ideas and metrics. But the same degree of focus and intimate familiarity with the business.
