 I notice two things that have long term impact on the health and activity levels and the longevity of the elderly. Reducing or stopping moving: You move more, you move more. One doesn't have to be "old" to see how true this is. Being active keeps joint mobility going. That, combined with doing activity to keep balance, prevents accidental falls, which are a significant form of injury in the elderly. The fear of falling is a pretty significant fear in the elderly, rightly so. But many think the answer lies in stopping movement altogether. The result can be a potent vicious circle type mix of loss of confidence, loss of self reliance & increased reliance on outside equipment and other people. Dismissing doing new things because ".. Now at this age": The body and the mind go together. When we make up our mind to do something with the body, it stretches & engages both the body and the mind. And the more active mentally & physically we are, the more alive & full of vitality we remain. Saying "now at this age" also says one is giving up. There is much writing, but arguably none better than Viktor Frankl's on keeping optimism alive and seeking meaning in life, and how that contributes to wellness and a life greater than survival. I don't know if the OP was seeking some other kind of answer on choices the elderly make. In my observation and studying decisions, these two recur as the two most damaging things the elderly can voluntarily do to themselves.
