 No.Because the OP wouldn't be allowed to use Quora. For the record, the question I have addressed is worded as follows: //Should only the people who have attained a certain level of English to post be allowed to use Quora?// This question can be written so much more elegantly but I am not going to suggest edits on this occasion. Quora allows users to suggest edits to questions & answers, and explain them as well. This can help those, whose knowledge of English may not be native-grade*, write better in the future. Some of the best - informative, eye opening, prejudice slaying, bias bashing - answers here come from people, who are from cultures where English is not the main language. This helps us all learn. Asking for a "certain level of English" is also an expensive and tricky feature to implement. I have on occasion edited answers written by native speakers* too. Who will determine the level? Who will test it? What is the incremental gain to the community for all the resources expended on this exercise? So, no. We should let all comers be and help one another learn.
