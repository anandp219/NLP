 A "sacrifice" is nothing but a trade-off where one enjoys the choice one made but for various reasons, continues to regret the opportunity cost or to miss not picking the other option. I have written elsewhere on Quora that I don't feel regret for any of my past decisions because at the time, they were the choices I made. No other people were harmed in the making of those choices either.The only thing I sometimes reconsider is my choice of living in the UK many thousand miles far from my father. The sacrifice is really his, not mine, as unlike the common practice in my native culture, he encouraged me to spread my wings and be independent and happy and guilt-free. I hope that somewhat addresses the question. Thanks for the A2A.
