 I read and recommend the following writers in no particular order. I am interested in a lot of things so if you seek patterns in the following, do so at your own peril. Marie Stein on travel, honest to goodness life wisdom, risk and governance issues Nan Waldman on sympathetic advice on parenting and child psychology Cyndi Perlman Fink specialises in perspective on age and ageing. She is 17 and going strong! Tamara Wiens has taught me all I know on trans issues while for gender issues and social justice, none better to read than Emily Smith, Ara Ogle, Kat Tanaka Okopnik. On Native American issues, Noel Rosario and Sam Morningstar are amazing while race in America, a sensitive subject is tackled smartly by Desmond Hardy, a man whose first answer made me tell him I saw him as a brother from another mother. On pop and film music complete with historicity, Aaron Ellis is da man. On literature in general and especially Hindi language, I recommend Kritika Gupta. She also writes impassioned and informed answers on social and environmental problems in India (some on garbage which are really worth reading.) Other India related writers I enjoy are Bala Senthil Kumar, Ishita Roy, Indira Sen, Archie D'Cruz - ok I will edit this a few times to add more names here. So come back and check later! On development and aid issues, read Nathan Ketsdever and Makarand Sahasrabuddhe. On U.S. immigration related advice including in startup context, Dana H. Shultz.Angel investing is best addressed in answers by David S. Rose. I have had some fun answering pop culture questions asked by and related answers (did you know he has seen Taylor Swift live?) by Marc Bodnick. Me!! It would be silly if I didn't ask you all to subscribe to me for delightful/ dry answers on obesity, decision making, startups, London, India (society and related issues mainly), Mark Knopfler and sundry other topics you can see on my profile.Edited to add: Darren Beattie writes the best answers on exercise and training.
