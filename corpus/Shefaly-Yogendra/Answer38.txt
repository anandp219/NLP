 I am not enamoured of choices and options. I don't shoot randomly nor do I shop around. I do research and usually only work towards what I really want. Expectedly enough, I recall taking the letter to the Director of my MPhil programme in Cambridge, with a long face, that made him think MIT had rejected my application. We then had a conversation during which he read the letter, laughed, and said: "So you are upset by an embarrassment of riches, with both MIT and Cambridge accepting you?" I hadn't thought of it like that at all, so I nodded, still thinking, "Damn, how I dislike options that are tough to pick between."So, yes, that was my dominant feeling - "Damn, how I dislike options!" - when I saw the acceptance letter from MIT.
