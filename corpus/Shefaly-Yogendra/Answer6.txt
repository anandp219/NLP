 Bitter tastes such as that of coffee and alcohol are indeed acquired tastes. As babies, we like sweet, rejecting many other tastes such as sour (ever watch a little kid's face after her first taste of a drop of lemon juice?).A combination of how we develop and mature, experiences we have, the sort of social example we see, the "reward" properties of some foods, and our own genetics then shape our acquiring - or not - of other tastes. As we grow, we experience more foods and tastes. If the family and social context is, say, experimental and open minded, one might try more things and decide like/ dislike preferences. A friend of mine gave her son his own corner in the garden and once when he was 4, I heard him ask if they could get baked artichoke at dinner from his lot of vegetables! He is now 10 and very keen on things such as oysters and snails which comes from a combination of his family context, his interest and his liking for new tastes. Likewise there is some evidence that some people dislike the smell and taste of coriander and it is genetic. Yet others may find their own preferences re smells etc override their social context eg one of my Bengali friends who hates fish, its smell and its appearance, and nothing can make the near-50yo try it! This is highly unusual for a Bengali person. Coffee may be an acquired taste for its "reward" properties as a stimulant. You can be sure therefore not all of us find coffee revolting. Equally you are free to like or reject anything you wish. The reasons are specific to you, if you are seeking an explanation.
