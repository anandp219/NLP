 "Do I piss you off?" I can answer this because I recently asked a long-standing friend (think over 20 years and counting) this very question. The likelihood of an answer or an honest answer depends on your friendship's strength and duration. My friend's answer was simple and honest. He said that my standard mode was "always-on" and high energy, and that I was always ready for an intellectual discussion, but he has not always felt up to the task. He added that some people may find it hard -- "be pissed off" -- to deal with constantly being asked to raise their game, be engaged, be their scintillating best. He however was not pissed off or annoyed because the conversations, where he didn't keep up, gave him a lot of things to mull over later. That probably explains why despite many times when I did likely piss him off or annoy him, we are still friends. I, in turn, easily switch off from people, who are floating through this world without observing, engaging, asking questions or taking a stand. Those friends don't get a chance to ask me the question at all. So, yes, ask away, but be prepared to hear what the friend says without being pissed off with yourself for asking and him/ her for answering.
