 In addition to what Adam Nyhan wrote, the A2A feature now offers names of people to ask based on question tags. These people typically have answers and endorsements in the topics tagged. So it is not entirely a random list. However removal of credits has enabled many to send A2A requests to previously "expensive" users. (And Anon requests can now be disabled altogether.) For instance see this screenshot of what I see when I click A2A on this very question. The grey partially visible tab is "all topics".
