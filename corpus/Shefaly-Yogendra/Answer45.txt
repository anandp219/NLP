 Reading* in bed, before sleeping, serves two functions to aid sleep [1] -- one, it establishes a routine which is shown to help people prepare mentally to sleep; two, it calms people down thus also aiding the process of falling asleep.However this only works if one isn't reading* on a backlit screen such as an iPad or another eReader. The display lighting plays havoc with melatonin levels and the circadian rhythm and isn't the reading that aids sleep.
