 When Madonna married the British film director Guy Ritchie, she tried very hard to fit in, to be British and to adopt British mannerisms. She bought a house in London and an estate in Wiltshire; although she didn't drink, she often accompanied her husband to Punch Bowl, a pub he owned, from where pictures of her asleep on a pub bench sometimes surfaced; she also reportedly adopted an English sounding accent. The British press loved it all -- after all she is a superstar -- and gave her the nickname Madge. Madge is often a nickname for women named Madeline or Margaret but it fit Madonna too. She reportedly disliked the nickname till Guy Ritchie spun her one saying it was short for "Your Majesty". On leaving the UK, she said in a couple interviews that she hates the nickname and that nobody should call her it any more.
