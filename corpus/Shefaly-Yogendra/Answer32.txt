 The crucial bit here is "in a startup". In that context, it is worth remembering that narrow specialisations do not come about in very early days; they emerge over time. Regardless of whether it is the choice of colours in the UI or the font size or indeed which products in a jewellery collection are actually going into production, a "creative decision" is about how a prospect or consumer interacts with the brand and its values, experiences the product, and decides ultimately whether or not to become a customer. As such, product and marketing functions serve the same common goal. Many answers here refer to software and hardware. In a consumer goods context, the "creative decision" resides with the creative director. This person has a set of skills and experience, that encompass an understanding of the historicity of trends, knowledge of key cultural influences at the time of making the decision, deep familiarity with consumer preferences and psychology and use contexts, deep understanding of the brand signature and values, a robust knowledge of materials, and sometimes, a person or a few persons in mind who can be persuaded to become unofficial product champions. Marketing works closely with this person to build the narrative, while product gets involved in the iterative fine tuning of the final form of the product in collaboration with this person. The final creative decision however rests with the creative director.
