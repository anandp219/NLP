 Self care. It is easy and common for younger caregivers serving senior citizens to draw upon their greater reserves of energy and early enthusiasm to do things like long night duty, running around, researching things etc. In the absence of eating and sleeping enough, and getting enough stretches and exercise, this burst can fade swiftly. In practical terms, this means the caregiver needs to be self aware, aware of how his/ her interactions with others change with his/ her own energy and restedness, and able to anticipate that care needs are uncertain, unpredictable and fluctuating thus summoning energies one cannot always plan for. Not being tired also enables the next essential. A heightened sense of empathy and anticipation.One could argue a caregiver already has great empathy but the nature of empathy and anticipation can vary by context. For instance, a senior patient in hospital may have access to attendants and nurses who help with loo needs and basic monitoring while patient remains in bed. But the same patient at home will not have this support. The caregiver will have to anticipate many things which the patient might have been able to have attended on-demand earlier. Empathy will also be needed so the caregiver remains alert to not forcing his/ her own preferences on the senior but working with the senior's preferred routine and some comforting habits.
