 Here is the fun thing about six packs: everyone has them. Most however are so protective of their six packs that they coddle it in a layer of fat. So essentially your question boils down to: what is the quickest way to get a six pack without having to follow a diet? And is there even a way to achieve that? The answer to the second part is short: no. For fat loss, you are best advised to take a nutritionist's advice and follow a diet regimen that keeps you energetic enough to cope with your life and encourages your body to lose its stored fat, till the six pack reveals itself in its glory. For most women this miracle may happen at about 10-15% body fat which is extremely low! For men, the six pack revelation may happen around 10% body fat or lower, which is very low indeed. If you do undertake this endeavour, please see a nutritionist for advice. Abs are made in the kitchen, as they say, but it is better to follow a tested recipe! All the best.
