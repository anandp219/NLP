 I walk up to him and tell him straight on his face. There isn't a single crush of mine who didn't know I had a crush on him. (Including Quora crushes!) I have always made sure he knows. Most have thanked me. Some reciprocated the interest. Some didn't. To leave this world without expressing love is a pity. I have therefore always expressed love and will continue to do so.I will also, always, endorse expression. Straight, simple and direct. Removes a lot of mental speculation too. Saves my energy! Go express love. The world needs it.For more of such answers, please follow my blog - Mindful musings
