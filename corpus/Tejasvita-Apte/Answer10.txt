 Parents are the first figures of authority in a child's life. Nearly all of the mental foundation of a human is formed in childhood. (Despite this, I strongly believe that nothing possibly short of taking another human's life is irreparable. You can mend anything within yourself when you decide to). Since relationship with parents is the first relationship any child experiences, most times, all our relationships later in life tend to mimic the first two. Either they are the same, or just the opposite. In any case, if you see closely enough, you will find a pattern. If all the child sees is disrespect and violence, he / she will either do the same or live in fear. Either of the two.Do not raise a child when there is mutual disrespect, violence and disharmony. While separation of parents isn't fun for any child, between living with parents who bicker constantly and separated parents, I'd say separation is better. If you are mature about the separation, if you do not treat the child like a possession and ensure that he / she knows that despite your separation the child will always be loved and taken care of by both, children understand. If not then, after growing up a little they understand. They also understand that sometimes two adults cannot be happy together. In such a situation, it is better to gracefully let go rather than be miserable together. And that despite the parents separation, the child can still be loved and taken care of by both.For more of my answers, follow my blog - Mindful musings
