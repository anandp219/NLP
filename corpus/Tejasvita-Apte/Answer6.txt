 Relationships are to be nourished by the two. It takes Two. Always. If one leaves, it's over. I have learnt only one thing from experiencing love. Above everything, I want my lover to be happy. If he decides to spend his life (time) with me, that's an awesome gift he gives me. I'd cherish it all my life. His happiness (with or without me) is always above everything else. If he isn't happy with me, nor am I going to be. And while his leaving may make me sad, I'll move on too. So if he decides to walk away, I'd accept it. Honour his wish. Love him a tad bit more for it! And hope and pray for his happiness. :) For more about love, life and psychology of everyday life, follow my blog - Mindful musings
