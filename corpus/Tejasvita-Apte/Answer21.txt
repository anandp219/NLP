 In a deeply contemplative moment, I thought of this - " I like the kind of music Silence would like" Every time someone asked me what kind of music I liked, I used to find myself in a conundrum. I couldn't really answer that question!I used to chuckle and say quietly - "I like musical music."Truth of course was that music wasn't mere entertainment for me. It wasn't about genres. It wasn't about the language, or style, or instruments or anything.I think I found a better way of putting it -"I like the kind of music Silence would like."Yes, that's my kind of music.
