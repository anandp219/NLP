 There are two things. I'll start with - Free Will - That 'I' am doing something in all this! The universe constantly tells me that I am NOT in charge. Nothing is in my hands. Any minute anything can happen. As I write this answer, I can die of a cardiac arrest.I mean, literally anything can happen. In fact my personal life has enough evidence that I am not in charge. I still try very hard to be in charge and convince myself that I am! Because if I stop believing that 'I' matter and am in charge, I won't survive anyway. So, this belief is imperative for my survival. I can be wrong - At the base of every belief I have is skepticism. I have read, got convinced, argued, tried to convince others of many theories, some of them my very own! But I have also been very open to change. To some people around me, that's shifting loyalty. To me, that's evolving! And of course the universe has given me plenty of examples that most often the simplest conclusions, or my first impressions were right. So, I may not be wrong all the time! Here's a question - My belief that I can be wrong when the universe tells me otherwise actually makes me right or wrong? There you go, I just gave you a taste of what goes on inside my mind! Stupid mental loops which have absolutely no practical use but which are fully capable of driving me nuts!A note on the word 'Staunchly' - I am not staunch about anything as is clear from my point number two. So, my staunch beliefs are staunch by my own standards.If you liked this answer, follow my blog - Mindful musings
