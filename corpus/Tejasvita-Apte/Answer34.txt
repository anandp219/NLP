 By taking it one day at a time. One battle at a time. One moment at a time. Battling suicidal feelings is terrible. If I have to use an analogy, I would say it's similar to the gut wrenching feeling you have right before you are going to vomit. A lot of people think it is just a thought and you can get rid of it when you want. But I know it is not. It is a thought you can feel physically, in your gut. So believe me, I know coping with it is not easy. Please go see a therapist. She can help you. When you think it is unbearable and you fear you might actually take a step, call a friend. Or call your therapist. Give yourself half an hour. Distract yourself somehow. But in the long run, please visit a therapist. Remember again, one day at a time... One battle at a time... One moment at a time... While you are at, address one problem at a time too. Be safe and take help.
