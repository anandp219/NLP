 Therapy as a profession is complex. It is highly subjective. What works for one person may not work for another in identical situation. Each therapy is different. Therapists often combine a lot of techniques and bring in a lot from their own experience. An otherwise successful therapist may not 'click' with you. Which is why it is important to get a few things straight. Separate 'ineffective' therapy from 'unprofessional or hurtful'. The two are different. While the former may only be a waste of time or money, it is never truly damaging. The latter can have a bad psychological impact. So, a therapist having an affair with you is unprofessional and hurtful. A therapist judging you and making you dependent on his validation is hurtful. A therapist taking your decisions for you is hurtful. A therapist transgressing his professional sphere is hurtful. A therapist with any other agenda but your mental well being is unprofessional or hurtful. That is all. The rest may not work or 'click' with you and may prove to be ineffective. In that case, find a new one.
