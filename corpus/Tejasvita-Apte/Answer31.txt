 I can think of two theories here - 1. Every idea is original if you can come up with a new way of saying itEvery idea any person has, is built on something. There is no such thing as an original idea. So, find a new way of saying it. Old wine in a new bottle. 2. Come up with a novel idea no-one has heard of - How can you do that? Again, I don't have any such ideas but I can think of the theory of it. Something novel means something which is not heard of before. How do you come up with it? By thinking in a way that is not 'obvious'. Anything which is obvious isn't really novel. Pick your choice. Either of the two may work. The former needs your skills, the latter is more of a 'Flash of genius' and may or may not happen in your life. Lastly, I hope you know it's okay to not have any new ideas! Not all of us are meant to be scientists or artists. Some of us are accountants! And the world needs them too. :)
