 I used to but I do not anymore. That's because I don't look down upon anyone now. At least I try. The only thing is, it is unlikely that I will have anything to talk to them after a point. Unless they have traveled a lot or are otherwise exposed to a lot of different areas through their work. But such people most often tend to be readers!In my experience, people who don't read tend to know less. Having an open mind has more to do with being a tad bit skeptic! And I do believe reading helps with that because reading expands our imagination and mind. But reading isn't the only thing that helps in being open. The other thing that should follow reading, is contemplating. Reading provides an excellent springboard for contemplation. I interact with people normally. But often, if the person doesn't read or travel, or learn something new all the time, I run out of things to talk. So, vis a vis me, I may term that person uninteresting.
