 It is not a breach of our Fundamental Rights as 'Right to watch free porn' is not a Fundamental Right in India. Nor is it a part of right to freedom of speech and expression. If you are to argue it though, it would be stymied by Reasonable restrictions. Every Right is subject to reasonable restrictions and they are defined under Art 19 (2) of the Constitution. They are the following - Security of the StateFriendly relations with foreign StatesPublic orderDecency and moralityContempt of courtDefamationIncitement to an offence Sovereignty and integrity of IndiaThese above 8 are the restrictions on our Fundamental Rights. As you see, porn would come under 'Decency and morality' and therefore our right in that respect can be curbed by the state. But ya, I share your irritation at the ban.
