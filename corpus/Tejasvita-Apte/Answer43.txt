 Wow. I quite connect to this question. I battle this feeling all the time. It is good that you are not suicidal. I have felt both the extremes. And I know that we have two options. One is to quit. Now that quitting could be either by actually taking your life, or resigning to feeling that life is a meaningless pursuit. The other is to give meaning to your life. And I use my words judiciously. I say 'give' meaning. Because it is our job. Life doesn't owe it to us. It tries hard though!! :)Life can only be as meaningful or as meaningless as we make it.I find myself going back to 'Man's search for meaning' by Viktor Frankl many times. A gem of a book. And I feel the answer to human search in part lies in there. "A man who has a why to live for can bear almost any how"So, making life a meaningful pursuit is on you. It is always a choice. There is no answer written by God in some book as to whether life is a meaningful pursuit or not. If it is, it's still your choice to follow it or not. Viktor Frankl gives a beautiful insight in his book. And I tend to agree with him a lot on it. He says man is a creature of meaning. That above happiness, we search for meaning. And that is the permanent (not momentary) happiness. Finding a 'why' to live for. That final search, the purpose of our existence is what gives us true joy. Gives meaning to our life. If I tell you life is a meaningless pursuit and if you buy it, it's still you believing me. If I say life is meaningful, it is still on you to find your own meaning. Choose now and choose well. Give your life a meaning or don't, there is no final answer. It is a choice. For more of these, you can follow my blog - Mindful musings
