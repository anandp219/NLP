 Haha... My University! Alright, I won't pretend to tell you what's best because there isn't anything like that. I will instead tell you about all the four and you can decide for yourself. Trust is an important concept to understand for any lawyer. So, even if you don't take this option, ensure that you read up the law so you know what Trusts are when you pass. It covers two statutes- Indian Trusts Act and Bombay Public Trusts Act. Criminology is the theoretical foundation of crimes and punishments in law. Provides the base for Indian Penal Code. If you do not take this option, you can read up the base of provisions when you study the IPC which will be a compulsory subject. Women and law as a subject covers all the laws relating to women and children. Some of these laws you will study in Family law, the rest of them, you can read up on your own too if you do not take this option. IT covers laws like Maternity relief Act, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, Women's rights and other provisions for and about women. International Economic law covers different economic conventions and treaties. If provides a good foundation for International law which you will study the next year anyway. Personally I find International Economic law a tad bit difficult because Economic laws are not my forte. The others are fairly simple. When I was a student, I had chosen Trusts for its practical importance. P.S. The syllabus may have changed a bit and I am not very sure of all the laws that are covered under 'Women and law'. I am fairly certain that I am right in general. For more on Indian laws, follow my blog - Blawgniti
