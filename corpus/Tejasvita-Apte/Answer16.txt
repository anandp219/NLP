 The biggest benefit women have is lack of responsibility. I may end up riling some of you at the first sentence, but I request you to read further. Women are taken care of in any patriarchal system. When I say taken care of, I don't necessarily mean in a manner they would like. The point is, all the decisions are taken by men. What sucks is, women get no freedom. But freedom always comes with responsibility. When you take away one, you take away the other too. This lack of responsibility is also a form of convenience. Even today when we can, I see girls not taking decisions for themselves because that comes with consequences. It is easier to allow someone else to decide for you and not take responsibility. As an added benefit, you can also later blame them if it doesn't work out and gain sympathy for being helpless while in reality it is learned helplessness. Every abused woman who chooses to still remain in the abuser - victim pattern is doing exactly this. Not embracing freedom because it comes with responsibility. It takes you out of your comfort zone. Out of known waters. Out of the convenience of familiarity. Personally, I would any day embrace freedom with the responsibility rather than the lack of both but not many choose that even when they can. And I can understand the temptation. This is the biggest benefit women have in patriarchy. Lack of responsibility. It takes courage to be free. Not all of us are ready for it. Having said that, let me also say that this answer is an observation. Not a springboard for generalized blame or condemnation. For more such posts, follow my blog - Mindful musings
