 I yearn for music. Good music. My kind of music. Music that silence would like. For good books. For words of wisdom. For words that will give me a new insight into my own self. I yearn to meet different people.Not all people. Different people. People with a different story to tell. People who have lost. People who have survived. People whose eyes smile. People who give me a reason to introspect. People who think. And people who ask 'why'. I yearn to find answers.I seek. In books, in music and in people. Answers to my eternal questions.I yearn to understand. To know. I yearn to see. See things exactly as they are. Sometimes, I yearn to yearn. And sometimes, I yearn to not.
