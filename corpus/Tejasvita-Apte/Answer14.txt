 Fascinating question! Thank you Harshal for sending it my way. I write to express. To connect. To understand and explain. To engage in an intellectual exercise that will take me deeper within myself. Exploring the parts of my mind that don't easily surface up. These are some pleasures of my life. Writing helps with that. If I end up helping another soul, that is the added benefit. Whether it is law or psychology, Mahabharata or philosophy, Music recommendation or movies, I enjoy it when I connect to another soul through this! This is why I write. Makes me happy. :)
