 Men who can cook and enjoy doing it are very Sexy! In general I find people who are doing what they love very sexy. It's a very attractive quality. In the culture I come from (Indian), traditionally, men don't make meals at home. That's always the woman's job. Because of this background, Indian men who love cooking are all the more attractive because it tells me that they don't follow stereotypical gender roles and are happy to follow their heart. Cooking is an art! It takes a lot of effort. I am not much of a foodie so I am not very motivated to cook complicated things. I try to keep my meals simple and healthy. For the love of complicated food, I go eat outside! So, foodie men who enjoy cooking are quite the opposite of me. Another reason of attraction!
