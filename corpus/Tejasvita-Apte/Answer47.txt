 Why do you think teaching is NOT doing? A teacher is also doing. She is teaching. :)That said, I don'e see a causal link in those who can't do, teach. Those who can't do, don't do. They don't necessarily teach. Many times those who teach, do so because they love teaching. Those who can't do, may sometimes teach. Because doing and teaching need not have anything to do with one another. They are two different skills. Lots of people do. But ask them to explain it and you'll be sorry you asked. Lots of people teach, but ask them to do it, and they may not impress you!We need both teachers and doers. Two sets of different people gifted with different skills.
