 A government hospital cannot refuse a patient on any ground. On the other hand, a private hospital can refuse a patient on any ground. But neither can refuse emergency medical care. Emergency medical care is a Fundamental Right in India that is enforceable even against private hospitals. Every medical practitioner with relevant expertise is duty bound to save life and provide emergency medical care. In Paramananda Katara v. UOI, a landmark case, the SC held that right to emergency medical care was implicit in Art 21 (Right to life) of the Constitution. It went on to include medical practitioners in private hospitals and practice as well. It also says that legal formalities are to be taken care of after providing emergency medical care even in medico-legal cases. Primary responsibility is saving life.
