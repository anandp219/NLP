 Any artistic pursuit is often backed by intellectual and emotional investment. I would imagine the same with music. As a lover of music with a keen ear, I can only speculate. Every piece of art comes into existence when the creator experiences something which she wishes to express differently. A person skilled in the art of painting uses colours and a brush to express the same. A person skilled in music, uses sound and arranges the notes in such a manner that he creates magic with it. But he is also choosing to express. So, it is this emotional investment, the desire to express something special, that gives birth to the art form. It then makes sense to name it after that desire, motivation, inspiration or thought. This is what I believe. To prove my point, I present - 'Touch me there' by L.Shankar and Frank Zappa - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...It touches you there! :) Enjoy. (Wait till the violin starts)
