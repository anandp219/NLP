 (I'm going to assume you're not cheating and that there is no evidence of you cheating that he could point to.)Sometimes people get paranoid and create a "drama" so others will pay attention to them. They are deeply afraid of being left out, forgotten (consider this is why you often see it with the elderly). The paranoia alleviates feelings of loneliness and abandonment. Even though in the long run it has the affect of alienating the very people they seek to connect to. The paranoia he's feeling - the idea that you are "cheating" - draws you in and makes you act in a way that is caring about him. Think about it, you deny you're cheating, you get mad at him, you emphatically tell him you're not cheating and that you love him. He feels like he's being noticed.He probably feels excluded from your life because you are working so much. He might feel like you've forgotten him or that you will, soon. These are normal feelings that couples go through and it doesn't mean he's insecure or crazy or that you are to blame.It just means you need to talk about it and address what is really going on.Don't talk to him about his paranoia, talk to him about what he's feeling. Remind him that you haven't forgotten him, that you love him, that he's important to you. Tell him that when he accuses you of cheating, it hurts you and damages your relationship.If he can't engage with you on this level, if he still hides behind this "cheating" paranoia, then it might be time to move on. He deserves to feel noticed, but you deserve a partner who will sort through his emotions in a mature way.
