 What you're saying is that you expect others to care and love you the way you care and love them. There is nothing wrong with that, we all do that. We show love in different ways and then when we receive it, if it's not in the way we give it, we fail to recognize it. And even think it's not there. I prefer to be completely alone when I'm going through something hard. Not bothered, not forced to talk about it - just left to sort it out on my own. So, naturally, I give other people space when they are going through something hard. To me, it is me being considerate and loving but you can imagine how well that goes down with my friends. Not great.If they are really close to them, ask them how they'd want to be supported. What kind of things they'd need. Maybe talk about it not in the situation but when things are calm and normal.Get insight from this. Figure out how they want to be supported and that will give you clues as to how they are probably doing it for you. Maybe in ways you don't see. Try to recognize it.Consider your own habits and approaches. Are you really helping them the way they need it? Are you doing what they'd want? Or are you doing what you'd want?And finally, if you have friends taking advantage of you and your generous nature, then reduce your expectations of them. It will be hard and sad, but you have to tell yourself that this person isn't what you thought, and just won't be there for you. And find others who will do better.
