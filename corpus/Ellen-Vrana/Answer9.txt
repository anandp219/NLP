 Yes, it is a terrific idea to read fiction while you write fiction. I'm doing it now. Writing without proximate fiction is like writing with half my mind. Inconceivable.I'm working on a short-story about friendship. Next to me I have a cat (incidental but I thought I'd mention him because he's my friend thus muse) a couple books with stories that involve friendship in childhood, two books that involve coming-of-age stories, and one book that is about friendship and loss in adulthood.These books are not stacked in the manner of a cat-fort. Although he'd like that. No, they are for me, to help me write.Reading while I write helps me improve technical aspects of my writing.1. Avoid cliches.Everyone else mentioned this and it is TRUE. The last thing I want is to fall back on elements that have been used to within an inch of their life. Friends that are complete opposites in nature but somehow understand each other, hmm bit overdone. Friendship that is a ballast against evil not as common but pretty obviously LOTR. Friendship that doesn't survive into adulthood, pretty common. And so on.2. Develop richer themes.What themes relate to friendship? Story 1 talks about betrayal. Story 2 talks about jealousy. Story 3 talks about power. Story 4 about loss. All these themes circulating the rich topic of friendship prompts me to consider what I think about friendship. Is it a transaction? Is it selfish in nature? Can it still exist once our innocence is lost? What is its relation to eros love? Does it have to be reciprocated? What are its lasting benefits and when do you see them most clearly, once it's gone?Had I not simultaneously consulted this other material, my own writing would have been flat and characters without values or motivators.3. Triggers memory-rich primary content (MRPC)I made up this acronym to mean my actual memories which I pop into the stories from time to time to give the scenes color and authenticity. My memories are triggered by reading, never writing. Because when reading, I'm expanding; when writing, I'm narrowing.Most important, however, reading while I write provides crucial mental and emotional rejuvenation.Writing is the act of pulling, extracting, building, tearing down, rebuilding. It feels violent and disruptive. Through this process by which we find and expose ourselves we ultimately produce something remarkable (one hopes) but to do so we must constantly fight against the process and the fear and impatience it engenders.Reading, however, is the opposite. In reading we turn ourselves over, surrender, passing agency to someone else. It is patience. It is gratitude. It is imagination extended. In its nourishing comfort I find strength to return to the toil of my own violent and disruptive work.No one can build the bridge on which I cross my life(1), nor by which I enter and slug through the yardage that is my relationship to writing. But reading can give me a cat to carry and maybe an umbrella when it rains. My writing wouldn't be much without either of those.1 Nietzsche on How to Find Yourself and the True Value of Education)
