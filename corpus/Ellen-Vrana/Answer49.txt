 As a 36-yr old married female, I get asked this a bit. I only reveal what I'm comfortable revealing. It isn't anyone's business but mine and my husband's).I deal with it different ways, depending on my mood and how nice the person is. With (awkward) humour- "What, we did! Last year, around May, finally got around to it. Did I not invite you? Oh well, next time!"- "Um, Little Davey is right next to me" and then pretend-stroke imaginary head. Bonus: pretend-find a nit and then pretend-look at it and pretend-eat it. Like a gorilla.- "Well, we thought we'd start with a pregnant goat first" (that's a pun).- We've decided to steal a child actually. Adoption takes too long. We're waiting for summer, camps - you know. Lots of kids. Wandering. . . roaming.- We said we'd have a kid the second their college education fund reached $5M. We're 87% there. One more quarter . . . - When am I NOT having kids?! I just have to decide to keep one of them.- We decided to raise squirrels instead. Faster breeders, better climbers, and well, you can eat them. I mean, legally.With honesty (over-honesty if necessary)- About 9 months and 1 - no, hang on - 9 months and 2 hours from right now. Using that very couch you're sitting on!- Really, we're trying but my uterus and his semen just aren't working correctly, what I think is going wrong is that when he ejaculates - wait, where are you going? Mom?- I just - I just fucking HATE kids. Hate them. ALL of them. No - not yours, YOURS are fine, but . . . With honesty and compassion - people ask because they care. It isn't there fault everyone else asks too.- I'm not sure yet. - We're not sure yet.- When it happens.And then they either give advice, ask specifics about we've done and tried, or, if I'm lucky, they will drop it. It's ok. It's because they care. I can handle. What I hate is that NO ONE asks my husband. As if it's all my domain as the female. What's that about?!
