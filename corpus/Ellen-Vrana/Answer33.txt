 Because they don't understand and that can turn into judgment. In outgoing cultures, being extroverted is the norm, at least in terms of what you see. Things that are divergent from the norm, are seen as abnormal. Most people just don't know any introverts. And when you are divergent from these people's personal preferences, it can feel even more disconcerting for them. Because it's personal.You're fighting a large battle here - changing the mindsets of all the individuals around you. But you aren't alone. Many, many people have written on introversion. On Quora, in books, etc. Read up and send whatever you find interesting to the people who judge you.Try to separate those who care about you (and are worried because they don't understand and perhaps fear the worst) and those who are just being self-centered and judgmental. Attempt to make the first group understand (I'll talk to them if that would help!) and ignore the second group, as best you can. We all have people who will never understand us. Even extroverts.That being said, above all - make sure you always do what you want for the right reason. Make sure that if you avoid small-talk and interactions, it's because you want to, not because you're rebelling in concept. Introverts, - myself included - have a habit of being overly self-protective because we feel if we don't, no one else will. But sometimes we can do it too much for our own good. Understand yourself - sounds like you're nearly there (bravo!) - then educate others. And find strength in other introverts, we're all going through the same thing.
