 It's not what you ask of your guests, it's how you do it.As a non-vegetarian, there are ways you might tell me this which would be fine and I'd say, no problem. And there are ways that would piss me off.You have a right to set the rules in your home and ask your guests to abide by them. And they have a right to reject those rules through the act of STAYING SOMEWHERE ELSE.But you also have a job as host to make your guests feel welcome. So when you tell them no meat in the house, try not to do it in a way that suggests they are morally inferior for eating meat.We don't eat meat because it's murder. ORMeat is so destructive to the environment, we can't sleep at night having eaten it.- might be true to you, but both are judgmental and unnecessary. If you can't help but say these things, you might want to reconsider why you want a morally inferior person staying in your house.Keep it perfunctory; In our house we don't keep, prepare or eat meat. I appreciate it if you could respect that while you're here. I understand it might be difficult and I appreciate your effort.They might still be offended. Or press you as to "why." Just keep saying, "It's our rule, it's the same for everyone. But we go out to eat, of course, to non-vegetarian restaurants."If they keep attacking you or your choices, ask them to stay in a hotel. They do not have a right to make you feel judged in your home or at all.Most of all, what is important is family, not eating habits. As the host, it is your job to help everyone recognize that, as much as you can.
