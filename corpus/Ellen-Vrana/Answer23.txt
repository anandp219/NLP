 You are asking if this POV-based structure (jumping between 1st person Points of View (POV)) is overdone, expected, or boring?The answer is no, not necessarily.That being said, it won't be original or inventive (The Memento boat of innovative structure just for the sake of structure has sailed, don't swim after it), writing a book with a different perspective each chapter ISN'T a book idea. It's a structure/narration idea that you'd employ AFTER you've developed your book/thematic idea. It is also complicated to execute deftly. You might want to consider using a very intimate 3rd person POV rather than 1st person.Sheri Fresonke Harper has great points on things to consider, read her answer.Additional considerations could include:Does each chapter use different perspectives to advance a central plot (House of Sand and Fog: Andre Dubus III), OR is there one plot event and the novel is about retelling that event through different perspectives (What are examples of novels or short stories that use multiple 1st person points of view?).The former is useful for a complicated plot where things happen BECAUSE people aren't aligned. Dubus's novel is exactly that, the lack of empathy these people feel is what drives the plot, thus it dances successfully between two different 1st person POVs.The later is useful for a simpler plot and deeper, richer understanding of the humans involved. You'd use this to demonstrate a theme based on how different or similar people are. The plot becomes a tool to illustrate your theme.How many perspectives do you want? The more you have, the harder it will be to keep them consistent and to make the characters rich, deep and developed. The fewer you have, the more you have to convince the reader that you need these two perspectives and not an omniscient POV which is easier to follow.Either way, I wouldn't use more than two 1st person POVs, it will give your reader whiplash. Any more than 2 and I'd switch to 3rd person POVs.Each character must have a strong, unique voice. Character voice is extremely hard for beginner writers, most of us churn out characters that are variations of our own voices/thoughts. But to do different 1st person POV or even 3rd, you have to differentiate your characters. That means syntax, pace, phrasing, self-awareness, and emotions need to be unique and consistent for each one. And you have to do it subtly so they aren't cliched (see Marcus Geduld's answer).To repeat one of the things Sheri mentioned, because it is crucial - you have to create a character that the reader cares about, invests in, roots or (or against). If you dance around too much, it can be an aggressive way of keeping your reader from connecting or forming their own opinions. Readers will resent you for that. You can also use different POVs to wrap a plot in tension or an emotional mood, rather than move it forward. Perhaps the characters aren't at the same time and place, one comes first to set the stage, and the second one continues with the main story. Amy Tan often does this, specifically The Kitchen God's Wife, starts 1st person POV of the daughter, reflecting on her mother today, then switches to her mother's 1st person POV reflecting on her past. While the POVs aren't synchronized by time they are by theme and emotions.
