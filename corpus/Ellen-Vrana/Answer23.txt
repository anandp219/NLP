 I can speak English fluently. Both British and American. I can speak Spanish very well, I've worked in Latin America many times and although it takes a week to get my head in it, I'm good. My accent and syntax is mostly Mexican Spanish but I can do many different accents.I can speak French pretty well but need a few weeks immersed. Have I used all 3 at the same time? Well, yes I have!We went to Morocco this past Spring, our car broke down. We pushed it into a gas station. The guys there spoke a tiny bit of French, but primary Arabic. I communicated in French but it wasn't working until one of the guys called a friend who spoke Spanish. So I spoke Spanish to him on the phone, he relayed it to the mechanic in Arabic and the mechanic spoke back to me in French. I relayed it to my useless German-speaking husband in English.That was cool. Turns out we destroyed our timing belt during some unexpected off-roading from Fez to Marrakesh. And they couldn't fix it.
