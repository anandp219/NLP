 You are giving way too much credit to the internet.Definitely do not say "A guy/girl on the internet did this...". . No one ever did anything cool on the internet. They did things in REAL LIFE and then WROTE about these things ON THE INTERNET.The internet is just content delivery, like a newspaper or TV.Say this instead: "I read about a fascinating individual Rory Young who lives in The Netherlands and spends his life fighting poachers in Africa and writes about What does it feel like to survive death?. Here, I'll read you the story."If the person asks where'd you get that from, say 'Quora, a really successful, high-quality Q&A site where people write personal experiences." If they still have a problem, tell them that Quora is like a newspaper except it has millions of writers and is published every second.
