 We met our first year attending Stanford Graduate School of Business. We were introduced by my roommate at a party we had in our room. I vaguely remember meeting him, I think I was opening the fridge at the time. He says today he instantly thought I was cool but dressed poorly. My roommate knew him already and said he was an asshole, but the cool kind of asshole (whatever that means). He was a finance guy so was a bit full of himself. I didn't think much of him until I got to know him. We used to text jokes to each other during class to see if we could make the other person laugh out loud. We had a similar biting sense of humor. I always made him laugh.And then we kept hanging out, laughing and talking, nothing too deep but over time he slowly SLOWLY let me see his kind, loving, tender side and I fell for him.He was in love with me from Day 1. Though he denies it.
