 This answer is more of an act than a line.For this you need 2 guys; a bar or drinking establishment, preferably crowded; and 2 women you'd like to "pick-up."Guy 1 buys a drink (beer bottle) and goes over near the girls and asks casually "Would you mind holding this, I have to tie my shoe." She looks confused but does. He bends down. Guy 2 jumps into the scene shouting "It's a trap!" Grabs the drink (without spilling) and says "Sorry, but you were holding a thermal detonator!!"HAHAHAH!!! Makes me laugh even typing it out.IF you don't get arrested and IF they get the reference, they will love it. If not - do you really want to date someone who doesn't get this?If rejected, instead of walking away in shame, look at each other and one of you do the hand wave; "These weren't the girls we were looking for" Depart gracefully. With drink. And dignity.
