 To be honest, the fact that it's expensive prevents me from stealing it. I "steal" inexpensive things all the time. Those little wooden stirrers from Starbucks, I use them to prop up plants I grow from seed. Is 5 stealing? What about 30?I once stole a nice computer bag out of a donate pile and used it for a year. That's stealing from Salvation Army, they could have sold it.I stole a bunch of perfume samples from someone's house - they were shiny and smelly and I loved them and used them.When I was really young, I used to go with Mom to the garden store and pick up all the fake flowers that had fallen into the aisle. The had come apart and were going to be swept up, but still - that's stealing.It's not good enough to say "Stealing is wrong" or "My conscious prevents me." It is a much more nuanced and complicated. When something is expensive, it has a much higher likelihood of belonging to someone. Someone owns it , values it, and it's not mine. And I don't think it's right to make it mine outside of the proper system.When something is extremely inexpensive (or tossed aside), it likely does NOT have ownership. (And in its aggregate it can't be expensive either). Thus, it feels more like picking up something that is useless to others and giving it a home.When I picked up the flowers that had dropped on the floor, I remember feeling love for them. Like I was going to take care of them and protect them, enjoy them. And I did. Until Mom found out and threw them away. I'm not saying this is moral or rational or even socially acceptable. But it is honestly how I think about it.
