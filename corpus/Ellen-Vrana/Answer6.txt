 If you want to hang out with him develop a golf handicap of no more than 8 and access to the best courses in the world. He's a serious golfer.If you want to talk with him get every back-copy of The Economist and be prepared to talk about interest rates and their effect on the Euro. He's an economist in his spare time.If you want to socialize with him bring a bottle, or two, of good non-peaty Scotch at least 18 yrs old and an understanding of how to make an ice cube. He's a serious Scotch drinker. If you want to get his respect, develop a sense of morality and virtues that are at the level of Mother Teresa. He cares about goodness.If you want to make him laugh quote random lines from the following movies: Dave, Hot Shots, Spy Games, French Kiss, any Bond movie. He has a weird, esoteric sense of humor which really never ages.If you want to impress him save 10% on everything you buy, ever. He is quite thrifty.If you want to attract him be a strong, confident, powerful woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind or have others dislike her for what she believes.You also need empathy, vibrancy, a willingness to talk to cats like they are human, and a hatred of people who unilaterally "hate" bankers just because everyone else does.And most of all, if you want to make him feel how special he is let me know how you get along because I intend to spend my life doing that, and I'd love a short-cut.
