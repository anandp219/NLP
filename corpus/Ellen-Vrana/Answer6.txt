 Yes. But not a novel, that would be a waste of my time since I don't have one in mind and anything I produce in a month would really, really suck and be fodder for stable-lining, nothing else. I have a few short stories which have been researched and sketched that I want to sit and write during November. I'll do those.Whether they count or not I don't care. For all in tents and porpoises, I'm doing it.And I'm really competitive. Watch out Jon Davis.I did it last year and what I loved most was that I could put everything and everyone in my life on hold for the entire month under this excuse. I'm always looking for ways to be a guilt-free recluse, NaNo did the trick. Can we also pretend to have one around April?
