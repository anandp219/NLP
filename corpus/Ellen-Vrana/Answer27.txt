 I know for a FACT that one of my cats hid the following information from his brother;If you jump into the shower while Ellen is in it you will get wet and we hate wet - so don't do it And THEY BOTH had to learn the lesson the wet way.Is that evil? Or is it proof that while cat language that has 50 words (sounds) for I'm hungry but I don't like the 5 options you just gave me, try another, it lacks the grammatical sophistication to communicate warnings such as If you jump into the shower while Ellen is in it you will get wet and we don't like wet - so don't do it.I don't know.I know for a FACT that one of my cats routinely puts food on his brother's head. Sneaks it there so the poor guy is walking around with food on his head, all day. Like a clown.Is that evil? Or proof that we need a bigger cat bowl because they keep eating at the same time and inevitably drop food on each other and lack opposing thumbs to do anything about it.I don't know. I know for a FACT that they both have their black hearts set on COMPLETELY DESTROYING a special bracelet of mine to such an extent that I can't even wear it anymore without their feline, canine wrath.Is that evil?Or perhaps they are simple, monastic breed who have accepted the simple life and are rejecting my selfish, bourgeois attitude towards material objects. I don't know.I know for a FACT that they completely disobey house rules that the chairs are to be stared at and/or sat on while the scratching post is to be torn apart. Is that evil?Or are they in the employ of my husband who also hates these chairs and has planned to diabolically destroy them since I got them from my mom.I DO know. In this case my husband is behind it. I think he's scratching the chairs himself and blaming the cats.But are cats evil? No, they are so innocent!Or are they . . . No. We're not evil. I mean - THEY'RE not evil. Photo credits; Ellen Vrana; Models: Morse and Lewis Vrana. Shot on location, London.
