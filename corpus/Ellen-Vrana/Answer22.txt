 True love is a destination at the end of an infinite journey that our lifetimes are too short to complete. Perhaps when you check off all the things below (and more) then you've arrived at the TRUE LOVE station:I love you, not because you make me feel how I deserve to feel.I love you, not because I'm scared of being alone.I love you, not because you're better than the last person.I love you, not because my friends or parents like you.I love you, not because you can do things for me.I love you not because you give me access or opportunity.I love you, not because it is easy.I love you, not because it is convenient.I love you, not because you keep me from being bored.I love you, not because you promote my self-esteem.I love you, not because you love me back.I love you, not because you reinforce my worldview and values.I love you, not because I need to love something.I love you, not because I'm replacing the love I didn't feel from my parents.It takes a special person to be able to say all of these things and mean them. I doubt either my husband or I will get there, we're not that mature.True love isn't a binary thing. It's not a line you cross. It's a journey, a long, long journey. And the longer you're on it, the less relevant the destination becomes. Almost like life itself.I don't give a shit if I have True Love in my marriage. Rather, I ask myself (in those rare moments when I'm being mature and reflective): Can I love my husband more purely and selflessly than I do now? The answer to that is always; YES. Yes, yes, yes.Does that mean I haven't found True Love? Does it really matter?
