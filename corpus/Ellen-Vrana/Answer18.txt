 Fictional characters can be judged, and they HAVE to be judged. What is the point of literature if not to hold up archetypes of humanity and reflect them in detail so that we might judge and learn?I say it's the truest hallmark of great writing when we can judge characters fairly because they were created perfectly by the author, notwithstanding the author's premises.Fictional characters can be judged as humans IF the author has done his job correctly and made his hand invisible.As long as a character's persona is developed and he does things that are consistent with his formation, self-awareness, needs, motivations and weaknesses (not necessarily predictable in terms of plot, but predictable in terms of character) then he should be judged.Darth Vader can be judged for killing the Emperor because his action was plausible, i.e. consistent with his character. It wasn't a deus ex machina or random hand of the writer to make the plot work. The story suggested his ultimate salvation earlier and then made good on it ultimately. It was a surprise yes but plausible, nonetheless.Is this the gesture of a total monster? Up to you.Another great example is Lord of the Flies, an viscous, dystopian novel that depicts the descent into barbarism of a group of young boys abandoned on a deserted island. In the absence of basic needs like food and shelter, the children's efforts at an ordered society fall apart and they turn murderous.In this case, we can judge the characters. Golding produced enough evidence in the situation to suggest that knowing what we know about these boys, this could happen.Golding doesn't ask us to believe his premise, he asks that IF we accept the premise, then to accept that this scenario might be the likely outcome. Whether or not we think the boys are innately evil or buy Golding's premise that their actions are more likely the product of class systems and neglectful parenting, is up to us, the readers. One could argue either way, and the fact that they are children is important, of course, but still, we're judging the characters.But regardless, in this case, the moral question of whether they are guilty ceases to be a question of fiction (i.e. is it conceivable that these characters acted this way) and becomes one of sociology, philosophy, biology etc.. (i.e. why did such characters act in this way.)So yes, characters should be judged, as archetypes or even individuals.  - EXCEPT - when they are victims of bad writing. "I'm not bad, my author made me do it!".Characters should NOT be judged if their actions the result of poor character development or laziness on the part of the author. If a character acts inconsistently, given the information we have from the author, then it's not fair to judge the character.Cristina Hartmann's answer What classic literary works do not deserve to be considered such? argues that Jane Eyre fails because the main character acts incongruously of what we'd expect in so many ways that in fact, it almost isn't Jane's fault when she makes the choices she makes, it's her authors'. (I'm more direct about this than Cristina is, I blame Charlotte Bronte entirely :).)Another example is Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn. I dislike this book. Sure it's easy to read and the plot was catchy, but the characters were horrible. I found myself baffled by their choices, unable to find their real motivations and hating them for being so erratic. As a result, I hated, I mean HATED the two main characters. Then I reread it. I don't think it is their fault. Nick and Amy - not their fault they were so erratic. Amy was driven to kill because her author needed her to. There was no other way to show her complete downfall and make us not see her as a victim. I maintain that there was not nearly enough compelling information that she would have been so maniacal or masochistic OR that she wouldn't have just killed her parents. Same goes for Nick, he was wholy inconsistent and unbelievable. That is bad character development, plan and simple. I blame the author.
