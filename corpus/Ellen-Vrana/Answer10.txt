 Writing like you talk is a good idea, writing as you talk (i.e. without editing) is not.Good, modern writing (for non-specialized purposes) should be AUTHENTIC and CLEAR.To be authentic, good practice is to write without jargon, esoteric vocab, rhetoric or pomposity. How familiar a tone you use will depend on your audience, but personally I prefer to read something that has a more formal than an overly-familiar tone. Familiarity is often cheesy. Checking your work by asking "could I actually hear myself saying that?" is a great way to make sure it is authentic.To be clear, good practice is to use minimal adverbs, adjectives, prepositions, objects and other aspects of speech that can confuse your reader or obfuscate your meaning.We all think and thus talk differently. Depending on how clear you think and thus talk, you'll want to do varying levels of editing. We all have to edit.I write exactly as I think because I'm a clear thinker. So yes, I write how I would talk. Except it's not exactly how I talk. After I write, I edit. I remove useless speech patterns, replace vocab, and improve the flow so my meaning is clearer. I call it de-cluttering.For example;It comes out of my head looking like this.Except it's not exactly how I would talk. After I write anything, I edit it many times. Among other things, I remove and replace useless words and phrases that are usually from my speech patterns and aren't necessary to what you're reading.After 4-5 rounds of edits, it becomes this;Except it's not exactly how I talk. After I write, I edit. I remove useless speech patterns, replace vocab, and improve the flow so my meaning is clearer. Because both the original and the final version sound like something I might say, the small adjustments to make it clearer on the page don't detract from the authenticity.So yes, write as you talk - with a lot of editing to tidy it up.
