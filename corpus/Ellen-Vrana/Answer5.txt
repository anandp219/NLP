 for myself.Shows like How It's Made and Bill Nye, the Science Guy (TV Series 19931998) were able to capture audiences because they show process. In writing, this is easy to do. Walk us through HOW IT WORKS. Perhaps ask us to imagine we are on the bridge and what we might feel and see and then tell us why. Add visuals, videos, links etc. so we can see how this works.c) Add a human drama to something that seems inhuman. This would be the Bear Grylls school of teaching science. Why is Bear Grylls so popular? Because of Bear Grylls.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...He is surviving, he is frustrated, fearful, worried, anxious, passionate. We care about him - THAT is the drama. When he eats sheep eyes it's a lovely bonus. Why does the bridge/soldier issue matter? Has anyone died? Do they march in a different way because of it? What is the human drama? The Broughton story is great: "In 1831 the British Army collapsed a bridge in Broughton simply by walking over it. What resulted was a change in how armies to this day walk across bridges." Humans & history was affected, that's interesting.d) Show us you care and infect us with your enthusiasm. Physicist Richard Feynman was excellent at this and thus, quite accessible to everyone, not just science-minds. He coined the phrase "A kick in the discovery" his term for finding something new and original. This phrase, as well as much of his writing, tells us much about who he is and how much he cares. When we understand and care about him, we understand and care about what he's telling us. You could add a personal story of your own related to the issue (I was on a bridge once and this is what happened). Put yourself and your passion into your writing. If we're going to listen to you, we have to know you. 3. Maintain empathy for your audience in your tone, words and examples. What does your audience react to? Try to minimize specific-speak that can be confusing or off-putting. Link to Wikipedia. Use metaphors or similes. Draw connections "the give of a bridge that allows for this movement is the same give that allows massive trucks to drive across or the force that can make us fly off a trampoline when someone else is bouncing on it" (I made up that science but you get my point).We all speak different technical languages, being aware of your own and how it sounds will help you speak to more people.4. Ok, MOST IMPORTANT - Now that you've read all I've said, take a step back and decide is this really how you want to write? It's 100% up to you how you write and for what purpose: to further scientific knowledge, to answer specific questions, to engage people in new concepts. Think about it. Why are you here? What do you hope to accomplish? What do you hope to give to others?I assumed you wanted to reach non-science people because that was your question, but are you sure about that? To what extent? Good luck, whatever you do, I hope you keep writing. :)
