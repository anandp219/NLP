 Quora definitely allows satire. But I don't think satire is what people think it is.Satire isn't sarcasm. It isn't just humor. It isn't flippant remarks or half-assed answers intended to ridicule the OP. Those answers provide zero value, are offensive, lazy and thus, should be flagged.Satire is an intelligent, highly-resourced and well-honed literary genre that brings out well-documented fallacies about a particular institution, group of people or policies so that the readers will be awakened to obvious truths of injustice (and thus want to change those institutions, people etc.). Its tone will be tongue-in-cheek and glip (i.e. not in earnest) but the content will be detailed, compelling. It doesn't take cheap shots by being racist, sexist, classist, or other - ist for the sake of it.If something makes you laugh and you move on, it's likely not satire. If it makes you laugh and think and squirm and care - that is satire.Right now, Quora absolutely supports satire. Among others a few Quorans who write witty, bitting, satirical answers include Noam Kaiser, Joshua Engel, Joe Geronimo Martinez, Feifei Wang, Erica Friedman, Robert Frost, Dan Knight, Dan Holliday and of course Upworthy's Adam Mordecai.
