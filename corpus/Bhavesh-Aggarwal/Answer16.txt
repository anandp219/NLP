 If a single pull-up is all you need to do, and you can get your arms to just below ninety degrees, I recommend observing the following steps to nail your pull-up in time.Back Warm UpOne of the smartest ways to warm up of for a pull-up is to do a couple dozen jumping jacks, and then push your outstretched arms back, thumbs pointing backwards. Hold that position for a slow count of ten. Feel those upper back muscles working and maybe even burning a little.Chin-UpsChin-ups are almost the same move as pull-up, but they tend to be slightly easier for most people, as they involve the biceps a lot more. Instead of grabbing the bar with your palms facing away from you, have the palms facing you when holding the bar. Try pulling up from this position, you'll find that you can reach the bar with your chest. Grease the Groove/Consolidation TrainingAfter achieving your first chin-up, take a moment every day, in the morning, the afternoon, and the evening to do the warm up I described and attempting one chin-up at a time, with ample rest in between. Try a total of 4 per session. After that, do pull-up negatives. Get the bar beneath your collar by jumping or using a chair to stand on, and hold it with your palms facing away from you. Then try to slow your descent as much as possible. Again, shoot for about 4 of these negatives per session.Putting it togetherYou will find that within 2-3 days, you'll be able to do two chin-ups consecutively, and once you can confidently repeat the feat within a few minutes, which will probably take another 2-3 days, you will have the prerequisite strength to do one full, chest to bar pull-up. All the best.Thanks for the A2A, Drew Blackwell.
