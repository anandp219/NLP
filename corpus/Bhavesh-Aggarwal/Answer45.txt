 Disclaimer: Assessing you without having seen you personally is hard, if not impossible. If the popping when doing push-ups per se is painless (and the elbows remain painless after the push-ups), then you probably don't have to worry about it. Sound is not necessarily a sign of damage. The lifts may give you some trouble because even if a bench press is the same in principle, it's a different challenge neurologically, and your body needs time to figure this out. Grab somebody knowledgeable, like a strength and conditioning coach, and have them help you out.If they do hurt, I recommed doing the following: Check your form, making sure you distribute the weight as evenly as possible over both your hands and also all of the arm joints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, fingers). It's important to keep the elbows tucked in and close to your body, don't flare them out, but don't push them into your torso either. An angle of 30-45 between the flanks and the elbows works best.Should you be having a weak tendon, I suggest regressing to knee push-ups for higher reps, and doing ONLY the negative phase of proper push-ups. Once you're comfortable with those, say within a month's time, move to full push-ups again and see how you fare. If the problem persists, get a doc and have them check it out properly. Don't let them serve you some pain pills and advise you to lift less. That's not going to help. You might need a qualified physical therapist to (p)rehab.
