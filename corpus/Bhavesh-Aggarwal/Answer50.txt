 No disrespect to you OP, but this workout's way too much on the endurance end to help you get fast. It's obviously causing a build-up of lots of lactic acid, and that is something you want to avoid when working on your speed. Speed is all about high and fast motor unit recruitment only taxing your ATP-CP energy system, and maybe just slightly touching upon your lactacid system. This workout isn't bad for conditioning the legs (and the core and back) to be resistant to fatigue, but it will do little for your speed, especially past the initial stage.If you want to work on your speed, do exercises like power cleans and power snatches, as well as plyometrics. And of course, to be fast, you must be strong. There's no such thing as a speed without strength.For a martial arts practitioner, you need strength, power, speed, a certain level of endurance and technique dialled in to get the most out of your skills.
