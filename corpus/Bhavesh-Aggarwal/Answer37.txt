 As we age, the loss of teeth, and reduction of hunger and thirst can cause us to seriously undereat, and many elderly suffer from a lack of vital macro- and micronutrients.The best 'supplement' older people can take is plain old protein from whole foods. Meats, dairy, eggs, legumes, and grains will all provide the protein to prevent sarcopenia, and a lot of other essential nutrients that a plain protein powder, or creatine, can't deliver.Couple this with resistance exercise to cause the muscles to break down and then subsequently build up, and you'll have preservation of or even an increase in muscles mass.That said, consuming creatine can help with increasing your muscle mass no matter what age you are. Try to put the horse in front of the cart, though, and make sure your diet is in place first, and focus on strength training to whatever extent that's possible.
