 Yes, absolutely.There's nothing wrong with a White author writing about Black characters. Your specific example is further made easier because your Black characters live on a continent where there are no White people, so there are fewer of those power structure issues that might plague e.g. a White American author writing about a Black American. Even then, White people writing Black characters isn't wrong or bad per se. A problem may arise if White authors are the only ones doing so, or making the character stereotypical or offensive, obviously. The flipside is that some White authors (and movie script writers) avoid Black characters as much as possible, allowing at most one thrown in there for diversity, without any true meaning to the story or depth. I'll take a well-attempted but somewhat flawed Black character over a complete omission any time. It's important for authors to research the history, culture, values, and views of the people they're writing about, but at the same time also allow for individuality and diversity within communities. Your case, again, is special, given that you've created a fictional Universe. You have much more creative freedom with how you depict various groups.Thanks for the A2A, Chrys.
