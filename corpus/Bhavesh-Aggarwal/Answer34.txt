 Depends a whole lot on where you want to get and where you are right now. If you're an 800 meter runner, and this is about improving your speed despite having large amounts of lactic acid in your muscles, you're better of doing shorter intervals with comparatively long rest. For example, sprint 15 seconds, rest 45. Go close to all out. You can make these a ton harder by decreasing the rest intervals, but running the same distance in 15 seconds. The longer your distance(s) become, the more you're probably looking into improving your aerobic power, i.e. higher speed without build-up of lactic acid. So if you're a 10k expert, you want to do longer intervals at slightly lower speeds. Again, as an example, sprint 40 seconds, rest 20. Accelerate to 80-90% of your maximum speed. Increase the difficulty by making the work interval longer (and consequently a lower percentage of your max speed). Rest until you've mostly cleared the lactic acid from your muscles. This rest interval should steadily decrease and/or the distance covered should slightly increase over time.What HIIT can't do very efficiently is give you the capacity to finish a very long race. That is something you'll have to build up to with longer, slower running. I also recommned you look into intensive and extensive tempo as tools to improve your aerobic and lactacid power.
