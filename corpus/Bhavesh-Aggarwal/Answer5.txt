 Correlating mile times and 400m times is difficult, although not impossible. The requirements of these two races are different, and thus being good at one doesn't necessarily mean you are good at the other, even if there may be some carry-over from the grit and speed you develop in either of the races.Generally, the shorter races are better predictors for performance in longer races rather than the opposite, but the further apart two races are in distance, the weaker the correlation becomes, no matter in which direction we're calculating. Otherwise, top sprinters would be able to become top marathoners too. There is a so called '5 seconds per lap' rule. That means every time you double the number of laps around the 400m track, you add 5 seconds to the time it takes you to run one lap within that race. Conversely, when you're going down in distance, you subtract 5 seconds.For a mile run (1'600m) your time was 5:55 minutes, i.e. 355 seconds.Because the mile is slightly longer than the 1'600m, we will subtract 3 seconds from that time to get an estimated 352 seconds (5:52 minutes) for the 1'600m. Divide that by four and we get 88 seconds per lap. Subtract 5, and your average lap time for the 800m is about 83 seconds. That amounts to a 166 seconds, i.e. 2:46 minutes 800m race. Finally, for the 400m, we would take 83 seconds per lap, subtract 5 again, and we get 78 seconds (1:18) for an open 400m race. Keep in mind, however, that many factors come together in each race, and they are run very differently. The method of building champion mile runners is vastly different from building champion 400m sprinters. Thus, your actual times may vary.
