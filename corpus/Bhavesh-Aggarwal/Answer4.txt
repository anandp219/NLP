 This is tricky to answer JUST in the context of height. Obviously, if there was a growth of 3 inches, you're not fully mature yet, and so not just your height, but many other variables must have changed too. Your physical strength will have increased, assuming normal development. So will the conduction speed of your nervous system, your coordination, as well the 'springiness' of your muscles. Naturally, more leg length helps increase stride length. This all bodes well for you.The one possible caveat I see is in the start and the acceleration. Even though your overall strength surely increased, it is possible that you lost relative strength (i.e. strength output in relationship to your bodyweight). This can negatively affect your start and your acceleration phase, which can make it harder for you to reach your top speed without expending too much effort and energy. However, the above mentioned factors should more than balance this out. Here's your data:100m time: 12.6 secondsAverage speed: 7.93m/sA reasonable estimate of your max speed would be around 9.2m/s. Most likely, it was slightly higher.Junior athletes tend to reach max velocity at around 30m, and you might have held that for about 20m. That would give you a time of 2.17 seconds over your 30-50m segment. We assume that both 10m segements contained therein were run at the same speed, so 1.085 seconds each.If we allow for a max velocity/acceleration differential of 1.5 seconds (typical for junior athletes), that means you run a 20m from standing in 3.67 (2.17 + 1.5) seconds. Generally, about two thirds of that time falls on the first 10m, and the other third accordingly on the second 10m. So the 3.67 is split into 2.44 for 0-10m, and 1.23 for 10m-20m, giving you an average speed of 4.1m/s and 8.2m/s respectively. We estimated about 9.2m/s as your max velocity, so the 20-30m segment was likely around 8.9 m/s (about 4% below your max), so the 20-30m split was run in 1.14 seconds.Now, for your 50m time, we have calculated a total of 3.67+1.14+2.17 = 6.98Assuming that you slowed down about 5% from your max velocity over the next 50m, that gives us 1.085s*1.05*5= 5.69s for the last 50m. If we add that up, we get 6.98+5.69, we get 12.67s, i.e. very close to what you actually ran (error less than 1%). Having grown taller, your gains will come primarily in the phase past 30m, so both your maximum velocity (30-50m) as well as the entire 50-100m segment will have benefitted. Most likely, with the natural increase in strength that you surely experienced, your first 30m will have improved somewhat as well. But, how much, is the question. Your stride rate during the race would have been about 4.4 per second, assuming you took strides that were 'natural' for you. That equates to 55.4 steps over the 100m, so an average step length of 1.80m. By the way, if we add 16% to this and multiply that by 4.4 steps per second again, we get your max velocity at 9.2m/s. The 16% is about the difference between average stride length and maximum stride length seen in 100m sprinters. Your height was 5'5", i.e. 1.65m. That would give you an average leg length of 0.825m, although yours were probably a little longer. That gives us an average stride to leg length ratio of 1.8/.825=2.18Now that you're 5'8", so 1.73m, your legs are .865m long.Applying the same ratio, your average stride length ratio is .865*2.2= 1.9mWith the same stride frequency, we get 1.9m/step*4.4 steps/s= 8.36m/sAt an average pace of 8.36m/s, your 100m time comes out to be 11.96 seconds. The difference will manifest itself more in the max velocity phase (30-50m) and then speed maintenance (50-100m). Your acceleration should be the same, or have improved very slightly. There's also a small chance that it might have become a little bit worse, particularly the first 10m.The 30-50m segment should take you 2.08s, (9.61m/s) and your 50-100m segment will be around 5.46 seconds.There are many assumptions in this answer, based on experience, measurements, and formulae that coaches employ. Not all of them are necessarily 100% correct, but the errors likely balance each other out, so the overall result should be correct within about a tenth of a second, provided you perform to your best.To further improve your time, you should focus most on increasing your general fitness with exercise circuits. This will go a long way in staving off the slowdown that comes after the 50m. Also focus on improving your strength, as your acceleration will benefit, leading to higher maximum velocity.Thanks for the A2A.
