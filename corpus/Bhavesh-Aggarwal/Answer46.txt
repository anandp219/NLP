 Good bodyweight exercise for the upper chest all have one thing in common. They are pushing movements with the hands 'higher* than the shoulders. Elevated Push-UpsPush-ups with elevated feet hit the upper chest hard. When I say 'elevated', I mean elevated to somwhere between 50-70% percent of your height. It's a great way to make standard push-ups more challenging, and get that upper chest to work.Lady, tuck those elbows in! Pike Push-UpsPike push-ups are often done with the feet elevated (although the basic version is with the feet on the ground), but there is a break at the hip, so you look like a half-opened jackknife from the side. The arms are in line with the upper body, and your top half looks almost like it's in a handstand.Handstand Push-UpsMany will say that handstand push-ups don't work the chest. Not true. If you're truly locking out and squeezing at the top, handstand push-ups work the top part of the chest hard.Do them against a wall, most people will not be able to hold a handstand and do push-ups without quite a bit of training.Your hand placement should be roughly shoulder width, maybe slightly more. This is a little too wide, and provokes the elbows into flaring out.*If you would maintain the arm angle of any of these exercise, and stand up straight, the hand would be higher than the shoulders. That's what I am trying to say. Thanks, Marek, for catching the unclear wording!Images from Google.
