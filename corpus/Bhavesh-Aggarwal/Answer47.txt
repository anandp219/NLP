 For the purpose of this answer, I will assume that 'working out' means some form of strength training, rather than things like jogging, swimming, biking.The short answer is: No.Speed is a function of high force production in short amounts of time. In human physiology, that would be contracting a lot of muscle fibers as quickly as possible. Strength training helps you activate and build more muscle mass, which in turn allows you to produce more force. Clyde Hart, a sprints coach at Baylor Univerity even says:Strength and speed are synonymous.Considering the vast successes of his sprinters, men as well as women, we'd do well to heed his words. But he isn't alone, all serious sprints coaches have their athletes go through a rigorous strength program. This is just to bring the point that strength and speed are interdependent.I will even go so far as to say that between specific sprint training without a strength program, and a strength program without specific sprint training, the strength program is likely to contribute more to your speed than the sprint training, especially for beginners who don't have much basic strength yet.Thank you for the A2A, Nam Hong Hoi.
