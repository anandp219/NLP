 Whenever you're creating a product you're selling to people (even if you're 'selling' it for free), you have to know what you're selling exactly, and to whom you are selling it. As such, what exactly will your gym blog be about? Will it be scientific, high-end discussions of the newest papers, discoveries, and innovation in sports science? Or will it be about success stories of people who went to the gym to get into better shape? The design of your blog, the language, the channels of communication with your audience, and the audience itself will be vastly different in these two scenarios.There are tons of other aspects, like the language of said blog, the focus on specific parts of fitness (diet, weight training, cardio, etc.)Finally, there has to be something about you that makes you unique, and different from the other fitness blogs out there. What that will be in your specific case is something you have to decide on. The most important part is to have fun along the ride, whether the blog carries you to stardom, or fails fantastically. Enjoy the experience, and learn from it. Thanks for the A2A, Anon.
