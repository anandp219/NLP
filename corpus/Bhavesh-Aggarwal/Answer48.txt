 Two things, because both were pretty weird.When I was little, I used to go to a kid's daycare where everybody spoke French. Most cartoons were in German, and we used to speak Hindi at home. I also, like Iwan, believed that everybody spoke Hindi at home (my Arabic, Portuguese, and Congolese friends, all of them), French at our daycare and German on TV. It was just the way the world was. This was until the age of 3 or 4, before my mother taught me to read and write in English.The other one had to do with aging. I believed that kids grew up into adults, adults mutated to old people, and after being in that state for a while, mutated back to 'normal' adults. 'Normal' being my parents' age of course (mid thirties/early forties).Thanks for the A2A, Biju V. Dev.
