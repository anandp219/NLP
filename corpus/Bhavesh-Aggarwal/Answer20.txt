 Ah, the most feared phenomenon in exercising, even more so than injuries: the plateau. Let's take a moment to understand what a plateau is. If we consider improvements induced by exercise to be climbing up the steps towards your goal, a plateau is a phase where you're not advancing. For some reason, the adaptation and improvement you seek from the exercise, diet, and rest you're following is not coming.At such points, you must pause, and reconsider what you're doing. Maybe, it's time to take a week off of exercising, or exercising your chest in particular. Maybe, you need to eat more to grow. Maybe, you've just adapted so well to your training that your body sees no use in growing your pecs. From what you write in the description, it seems the the third option is the case. You did a workout for some time. You got all the gains you could from it.If you want to intensify your training, and make improvements, you need to shake things up. Add to the challenge, and watch your body adapt. I've written an answer on this subject before, and all of the ideas in it apply to your situation.
