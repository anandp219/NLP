 When I hear or read the word Pakistan, a flurry of words race through my mind. "Friends", "family", "sadness", "separation", "unity". My view of Pakistan, given that I've never been there, is colored by the Pakistani people I have had the privilege to know growing up and living in Switzerland. It's based on some Bollywood movies -more so than others- and it is largely influenced by my understanding of Indians. Last but not least, stories of other people who have gone to Pakistan or who live there. South Asia, and the Indian subcontinent in particular, is much more volatile than many people and media outlets would have you believe. As such, the region can only progress when the various countries within put aside their, generally minor, differences, sit around the table, and finally start addressing problems and solutions together. I know the above is somewhat idealistic, although there are increasing efforts of cooperation, which is a good sign.And so, in conclusion, I have the same things to say to the great nation of Pakistan what I would say to any nation, really:Know yourself, acknowledge every part of yourself, accept what is beneficial or irrelevant, and fight tooth and nail the things that keep you from advancing towards a better, brighter, more egalitarian and fairer future. Know your friends, and make more of them. Allies slumber in likely and unlikely places, reach out to them. At the end of the day, I want to see you, and your people, whom I consider to be my  people, live long and prosper.Happy birthday, Pakistan, and a happy independence day to all those who call you their home.Thanks for the A2A, Anonymous.
