 I've found that a baby face, especially one that's not obstructed by a beard, leads to more people helping you in a sticky situation. Particularly middle aged and older women seem more inclined to feel sorry for you. You also escape some of the distrust people level at young men, even if you're a person of color. Many people enjoy the feeling of being considered fascinating, and a baby face is the perfect tool to express wonderment. But by far the greatest advantage of a baby face, bar none, is the sneakiness. People rarely doubt me even when I am lying straight to their faces as my toddler eyes and pre-school smile lower their guards for me. Conversely, guys my age often think they can pick on me, because I look like an easy target. That can be a disadvantage or an advantage, depending on the situation. In some cases it helps to be underestimated.Thanks for the A2A, Chris Lo.
