 The origin of a muscle is the point on a bone where it is said to 'start' as a rule, the origin tends to be higher up, or closer to the midline than the insertion. For the 'normal' action of a muscle, the origin remains immobile.The insertion is where the muscle attaches to another bone further down, or further from the midline. This is the bone the muscle 'acts' on. The action, finally, is what the muscle does. For example, the pectoralis major muscle adducts the arm (among many other things). A single muscle can have multiple actions, often determined by which direction the activated muscle fibers are running in.Last but not least, depending on what parts of the skeleton are being stabilized, the muscle can use its insertion as an origin and act on the origin as if it was an insertion.
