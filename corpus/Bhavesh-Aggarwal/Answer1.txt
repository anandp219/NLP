 What a horrible argument to bring forth. I'm sorry you're dealing with this, OP.But, let's take the go-to transgender woman of the year 2015: Caitlin Jenner. Here she is in nineteen seventy something:Back then, she was known as Bruce, and definitely had no lack of testosterone.And yet, she is definitely a woman. Because she says she is.You could also counter that as men age, their testo levels decrease, and they don't just suddenly wake up one day and 'decide' that they are women, and vice versa with estrogen for women, particularly post menopause.Of course, this is if you're even going to entertain their ridiculous premise. I know, some people are just hard to shake off.
