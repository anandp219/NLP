 My reasons are almost same as Virali's. I am very picky about the blogs that I follow on Quora. I follow the popular and interesting ones but I almost never follow new blogs (I know this can be argued as not providing enough opportunities to new writers for them to prove their worth, but I compensate for that by upvoting a lot of "unseen" content.)The reason I do not follow any blogs immediately are -1. Their notifications hinder the visibility of notifications for answers on questions I follow. Just like blogs, I follow just a few selected questions. So, I read each and every answer that is written for those questions. With the advent of blog post notifications, I panic seeing so many notifications and in frustration, usually clear them all in bulk (and regret later). I know I can use new Quora design of sorting the notifications based on categories but I don't like that design either. Also, I have this OCD of clearing each and every notification that I get on any social networking site.2. New people usually don't know Quora very well and at first write copied content as blog posts. There are hundreds of science blogs, sports blogs, latest news blogs, "interesting and cool stuff" blogs on Quora and most of them copy the articles from newspapers or other blogs on the internet (mostly without attribution). I know people learn with time, about how to better use Quora, but again, I am not one of the persons who can help them with that.So, I just ignore any invitations to join blogs by people I don't personally know.That said, if I know someone well and have respect for their writing, I would at least accept the invitation to follow their blog. I may unfollow it later based on my interest in the content of the blog, but I would at least give it a try.
