 It all depends on what you want to do in your life or what you are passionate about. Since you had to ask a question on Quora, I think you are already confused.First of all, do you have an absolute passion for coding? Do you want to make a difference in the world with your coding skills? If yes, then go for masters and after that go for a PhD. You have got a very good rank in GATE so you should get a top IIT, if not IISc. Trust me, this will give a real boost to your knowledge of coding and computers in general. I have done an internship in IISc Bangalore and I know how high the level of postgraduate students in IISc (or any other top college in India, as a matter of fact) is, as far as their knowledge of computer science is considered.On the other hand, if you have chosen this line only because you want to earn and enjoy your life spending that money then stay in the job. Doing a masters for two years might fetch you just a slightly better job with a slightly better package. Yes, the promotions will definitely be faster. In fact, with a masters degree, you will reach a managerial position much faster than your bachelor counterparts. But again, if money is the only motivation, you would get enough of it even at a second-to-manager position. There is no need to waste 2 years of your life for this.So just be sure what you want. Neither of the above options are bad. Even though the Indian youth is inclined towards getting a masters degree and then may be go for a PhD, there are a lot of people who just love working in startups or MNCs and live a comfortable life with the earnings.Just be sure what gives you the inner satisfaction and go for it.
