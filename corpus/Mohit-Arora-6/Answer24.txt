 Oh yes, definitely. This has stirred the debate on how important security is to a top IT firm (or any other firm as a matter of fact). Most of the big firms spend a lot of time and resources in security training of their employees. Employees are taught not to click on any suspicious links, to not use office internet to browse the web or sites that can bring a potential malware to the firm's servers. Downloading movies or audio/video files is banned in most of the IT firms. But no matter how well you protect your servers and data, there will always be people who would find a flaw in your system. MySpace was pretty confident about their security mechanisms until a single person brought down their entire network and gave birth to a new type of attack which got his name, Samy. Apple is one of the leading IT firms, and even they couldn't protect their users' data.It's not like the laws against piracy are lenient, it's just that in most cases it is almost impossible to track the hacker. Even in Sony's case, both FBI and NSA are just speculating that the attack originated from North Korea. It's almost a month and they do not have any solid evidence about who did it. Basically, there is no one to whom this law can be applied.People will talk about how important security is, for few days. All the big firms will make a training course for their employees explaining how Sony got attacked by the hackers and ask them to be careful and not repeat Sony's mistakes. People will just somehow complete that course and then get back to doing what they have to do.
