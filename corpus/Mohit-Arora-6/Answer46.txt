 I can provide my subjective opinion here.Carrie's character was never an emotional one. It is clear from the epilogue of season 3 finale that after four months of Tehran incident Carrie moved on in her life and was pretty excited about the opportunity to work as a station chief in Istanbul. Apparently, she didn't feel "love" for her own baby. For Carrie, it has always been about her job and her career. The only person she ever got emotionally attached with was Brody and probably because of that attachment she decided to keep his baby.Now about the incident. She didn't care on emotional level. She told Quinn, "The worst case scenario is that it was a real wedding but who do you think will come forward and witness that? No one." (not her exact words, but close.) Not once she showed any sign of regret or guilt or dejection. She was more worried about her job because now she and the embassy need to give an explanation to the foreign minister about what happened in Pakistan.She was obviously troubled because she acted on a half cooked information and now have to take all the heat but I highly doubt that she was stirred on emotional level.
