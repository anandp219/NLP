 Considering who he was after, I don't think it was crazy on Jimmy's part to go inside the tent without any backup.He knew that Kettlemans were not very "smart" and he also knew that they were not the kind of people who would hurt someone, let alone in front of their kids. Sure, they were involved in the embezzlement of funds but they were not criminal by nature.Jimmy still telephoned Kim letting her know that he found the kettlemans camping in the mountains and the police was already looking for them so if the need be, he could have played that card and tell the kettlemans that police knows he is there with them.He had no fear of the kettlemans. That's why he made quite a comic entry into their tent.
