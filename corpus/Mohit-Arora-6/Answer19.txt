 Because Bob was just too honest to do something like that. As I mentioned in one of my other answers, he was a kind of person who believed in non-violence until the time it is acceptable and tolerable. He also didn't believe in injustice.How many times we see a person picking a heavily injured dog from someone else's trash can, take care of it, and is ready to pay 10,000$ for it? Bob probably believed in a just world. Where everyone plays the role which has been assigned to them.It doesn't mean that Bob was weak. He killed "Glory Days" and when it was too much, he even put a bullet in Deeds' head. But he did that only when it was too much for him to tolerate.He was also a loyal person. He was not a rat like Marv (it may be wrong to call Marv a rat because he probably did it out of frustration of losing his bar and income to Chechen mobsters).Marv knew all these things about Bob. He knew that Bob would never agree to be a part of his "plan" and he could have even tried to stop Marv from doing such a thing. No, he wouldn't have gone to Chovka complaining about Marv. But he would have made sure that Marv do not do something this stupid.
