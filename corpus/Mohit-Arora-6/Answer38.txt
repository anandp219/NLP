 As I have mentioned in some of my related answers on Quora, Carrie is not an emotional person overall. She was never an emotional person. Brody was the closest she came to being a sentimental person. She has little love for her sister and father. This has probably something to do with her being bipolar. Carrie is not a type of person who can handle babies. She LOVES her job. The only reason she kept the baby was that she truly loved Brody and probably wanted a part of him to be with her (even if Brody somehow made it to the US, he would have been arrested and sentenced for life). When Brody died, she came to her senses and realized that she cannot handle the responsibility of a baby. That is when she wanted to go for an abortion but her father and sister stopped her from doing so. So, she didn't love her baby even before the baby was born.That said, there is no doubt in it that the Baby was Brody's. Earlier, Carrie didn't want anyone to know this thing. She didn't even tell Brody that she was pregnant with his baby until they were in the safe house in the last episode. Again, she was tremendously confused whether she should give birth to this baby or not and probably that is why she didn't tell anyone about it.
