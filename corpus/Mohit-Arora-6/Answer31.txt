 The below list is in no specific order.1. The Walking Dead - One of the best TV shows currently on television. This show has an awesome plot (taken from the comics of same name), great character development, and it never seizes to surprise or thrill you. Almost all the seasons are terrific and each and every episode takes the serial further, there are no stale episodes in any of the season so far.2. The Sopranos - If you loved movies like The Godfather or Casino or any of the mafia movies then you will surely love this serial. James Gandolfini, as a mafia boss in New Jersey, did an amazing job as an actor. Also, the soundtrack of this serial is amazing. Even the side characters did an amazing job. Edie Falco and Michael Imperioli brought life to the serial. I would say "The Sopranos" is the best drama ever aired on the TV (even better than The Wire and Breaking Bad)3. Breaking Bad - This is all about Bryan Cranston. The character development of Cranston from a high school chemistry teacher to a drug lord is amazingly portrayed in this serial. While watching this serial you will feel like you are experiencing all that drama in real time.4. Sherlock - It is difficult to not like this show. So much nerdiness and such great acting by Benedict Cumberbatch. 5. Modern Family - And just to add a pinch of humor in all this drama. This is one original show with genuine jokes. And the best thing about this show is that it let the audience decide whether they want to laugh at a certain joke or not. There are no irritating background laughing sounds that play with each and every stupid punch line. Especially the characters of Luke and Phil are extremely funny.
