 I think Bob was a type of guy who never wanted trouble. He was a very calm person and during the entire movie he never lost his cool. Even while putting a bullet in Deed's head, he showed just a little signs of anxiety. During the robbery, he didn't try to stop the robbers, didn't panic or provide any kind of hindrance (Marv's reasons of not showing any resistance were understandable as he was in on it).I believe he would have given Deeds the money, had he came to his house earlier that morning. Even at the bar he would have handed him the money if he didn't bring Nadia into all this. He kept the gun just in case something goes south. I think he never intended to use the gun.Another thing, he was not going to hand the money to Deeds just like that. He expected Deeds to give him the registration papers of Rocco so that Bob can get the ownership of the dog. I think Bob believed in non violence until the point it is acceptable and tolerable.
