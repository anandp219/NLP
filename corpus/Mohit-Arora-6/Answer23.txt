 I am not sure. I would say it's a 50-50 chance. There are a few things that do not resonate with the fact that the North Korean government could have been involved in this hack - 1. The only thing that links North Korea with this cyberattack is the movie "The Interview". But if you look at the original hack then there was no mention of the movie. The hackers didn't say anything about it in the statement they issued to Sony pictures. Nor was it mentioned in the message that appeared on the employees' hacked computer screens. The threats to not release the movie started almost a week after the hack.2. This was a well planned attack and would have taken at least few weeks of planning, if not months. I don't think at that time North Korea would have the knowledge that a movie like The Interview, which is based on a plan to assassinate their supremo, was under production. So, the attack was not made just to stop this movie from airing.3. Almost everything points to the fact that this is an inside job. It was like the hackers knew the entire structure of Sony's network. They even had hard coded paths and passwords in their code. 4. There is no solid evidence that points towards the involvement of North Korea in the attacks. The attack was initiated from Bangkok and it was routed from China. Also, with the advancement of Internet, it is possible to mask the attack from anywhere in the world. Unless an attacker openly takes the responsibility of the attack and declares their affiliations, I doubt that FBI and NSA would be able to prove North Korea's involvement.All these points do not rule out the involvement of North Korea in the attacks but certainly bring down the likelihood of their involvement.
