 Thanks for the A2A, but this question is not significant anymore. Earlier this year (2015), Quora had pulled off the role of Moderators on their website.Now there are "trusted reporters" on Quora instead of moderators. All the people who were moderators are by default trusted reporters and they have most of the powers that they used to have when they were moderators. One plus to this arrangement is that now anyone can become a trusted reporter. If a normal user constantly report bad stuff and most of their reports are genuine then they might also become a trusted reporter and will have the power to collapse answers right away.Even though the answers reported by trusted reporters get collapsed right away, they are still sent to the reviewing queue of admins, and admins have to power to revert the operation of a trusted reporter.One difference is that moderators used to have the power to lock and delete questions but trusted reporters do not have this power. Trusted reporters' power is pretty much confined to just the answers written on Quora. But yes, their reports carry significant weight and given higher priority than a normal user's reports.Moderators used to have a separate dashboard which showed the number of answers and topics that need to be reviewed. It also showed the statistics of other moderators, i.e, how many topics and answers top 5 moderators have reviewed in a particular month.
