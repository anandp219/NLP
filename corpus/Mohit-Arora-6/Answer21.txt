 I think it came from the Chechen mobsters as a reminder of what happens to people who screw with them. Bob gave the crucial piece of information to the police that one of the robbers was wearing a broken watch which was stopped at 6:15. I think Chovka (Chechen mobster) had connections in the police department and he got to know about this broken watch thing from them. When Chovka came to see Bob and Marv the next day, he already had that one robber in his car bleeding to death. Even though they didn't show his face (or the watch), he was probably the same robber who robbed Marv's bar.May be Chovka had his doubts about Marv or Bob because the robbers knew that Marv's bar was going to be the "drop" bar. So, it has to be an insider's job. But Chovka couldn't take the risk of prosecuting Marv because he was his trusted companion for 10 years. So, Chovka played a little and decided to set Marv's bar as a drop bar for super bowl night when the cash was supposed to flow like water. And Marv was stupid enough to try to rob it once again.That's the reason why no questions were asked when Bob and Marv returned the money to Chovka.Could Marv have planted the bag himself? Possibly, but I think the chances of Marv doing this are slim.First, why would he cut the arm of the robber and plant it in his own bar? I mean, it does not send any message to anyone. If he wanted to convey that nobody can screw with him then he should have sent that hand to Chechen mobsters to let them know that he took care of the people who robbed him.Also, why spoil the money with all the blood when he knew that he will have to deliver the money to Chovka anyway and will have to clean it up?Another thing, his reactions when Bob asked him to look into the bag was of disgust and fear. It looks like he didn't know what was in the bag and he didn't even want to know.
