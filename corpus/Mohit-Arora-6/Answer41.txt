 I am pretty sure Saul is missing all the CIA action. There has been a lot of hints in the show that point to this fact.1. When Dar Adal and Saul had a conversation in the restaurant in season 3 finale, Dar was pretty convinced that Saul will come back to CIA in a heartbeat if Lockhart comes begging to him. And Dar knows Saul better than most of the people in the show (I think even better than Carrie).2. When Carrie asked for Saul's services to strengthen the security in American embassy in Pakistan, he didn't even think twice before making a decision. He just wanted an excuse to be a part of all this CIA adventure.Another explanation can be that he wants to protect Carrie. He is the one who recruited Carrie and she has always been under his umbrella. The fact that she is out there chasing the bad guys and Saul cannot put tabs on her anymore must be making him uncomfortable.I am pretty sure Saul will find a way to remain in Islamabad (or may be the circumstances in the next episode will make him). Even if he goes back to the states he is definitely gonna be a part of CIA in one way or another. He might even replace Lockhart according to the conversation between him and Dar in the second episode.
