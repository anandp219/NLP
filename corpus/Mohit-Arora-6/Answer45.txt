 There can be two possible explanations for this - 1. The most important one, according to me, is that Carrie needs Saul back. She needs his support and intelligence. It is tough times for her and it is going to be tougher when her enmity with Lockhart will probably grow in next few episodes. I think we might see Saul in Islamabad (on behalf of his agency, of course) in the next episode. I don't know if it comes in the jurisdiction of a station chief to make such decisions but from the looks of it, it seems so.2. She probably thinks that it was the security team's responsibility to keep a tab on what the CIA personnel do. Apparently, no one had any idea about Sandy's informant(s). There had to be a pretty strong connection between the two parties. They must have talked several times on phone and in person. Yet, no one knows a thing about this unknown informant. I understand that this is a secret information but I also think that Sandy was way out of line (by CIA standards) in getting this information for the CIA (or for his boss?)I don't think the makers of the show paid much attention to provide any details here. It was pretty casual conversation and it seemed to me that Saul was actually expecting this conversation. A person like Saul, agreeing to something like that in a blink of an eye is not a small deal.
