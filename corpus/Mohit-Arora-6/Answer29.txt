 I would say it is optional and its presence should depend on the years of experience you have working in the industry. If you are a recent college graduate then it is always a good thing to have an "objective" in your resume. Not that a lot of people would read it while interviewing you but it at least show, to some extent, your ambitions and the reason you want to do a job and not go for higher studies.Once you have some experience working in the field then, IMO, there is absolutely no need of putting "objective" in your resume. The recruiters know what your objectives must be and they would be more interested in the projects you had done/is doing in your previous firm then knowing that you want to join their firm for "career growth".
