 I cannot speak for myself because, according to me, I have a lot more followers than I deserve. But I agree to your general point, there are many good writers on Quora who are just unnoticed and there are a lot of reasons to account for this behavior. Off the top of my head I can think of three major reasons that, according to me, explain this phenomenon.1. Quora's machine learning algorithms - Whenever a new person joins Quora, they are asked to follow some people who Quora thinks would bring quality content to the user's feed. Most of these suggestions are established writers who already have a lot of followers and have written hundreds of answers. Rarely, a new budding writer makes the cut. So the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer.2. Popularity bias - No matter how much you deny it, in your heart you have to agree that when there are two answers written for a question, one of them from a Quora celebrity and another one from someone unknown, you will probably just read the first answer and even if you don't like it wholeheartedly you will still upvote it because you know that the person, overall, is a good writer. Even if the second person has written a good answer, you will probably not give it as much attention as you gave to the first answer. This limits the circulation of new writers' answers.3. Indian population on Quora - Indian population on Quora is sky high. So if someone writes something that shows "Indian-ness" they are likely to get a lot of views on their content and if the quality of the content is good, a lot of followers. Even if you are a good writer, but you only write on topics like US politics or baseball, or rugby or anything that is not popular in India, you are probably not gonna get all those Indian followers.There are a lot more other factors that decide one's popularity on Quora. But again, as Xu said, after one point of time, it all just feels useless.
