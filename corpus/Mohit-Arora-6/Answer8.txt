 It's one of the worst shows I have ever seen. If you have not started it yet then please don't watch it.I just finished episode 5 of season 3 and I am cursing myself that I decided to start watching this TV series. I have a thing for closures and it is really very hard for me to stop watching now. But every episode of "The Following" I watch, I feel like I am just wasting my time. Yes, it is that bad.As some people pointed out, season 1 was at least decent. They had an average plot and the acting was not all that bad. Season 2 was BAD. And season 3 is turning out to be pathetic. I don't know, it might be a very good serial for some people but I just don't get it.For me, a great show has an amazing plot and great acting. I do not want any special effects, any action scenes or other stunts. But this show lags both these things. There are so many loopholes in the story that sometimes I feel like the makers of the show think that their audience is a 5 years old kids who do not know what FBI does, or who are just so simple minded that they have no idea what happens in the real life. Kevin Bacon's acting is decent but Shawn Ashmore and Jessica Stroup just ruins everything.I am really frustrated with this show. Please read the opening paragraph of this answer again.
