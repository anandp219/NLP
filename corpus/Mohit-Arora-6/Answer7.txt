 It might be. There are a lot of chances of this being the trigger for Mike to dwell into the life of crime. But only the future episodes will tell.His family is everything to him. He blames himself for the death of his son and will do anything to suppress that guilt. He knows that Stacey is just trying to use him when she says "of course, this is just a drop in the ocean." Mike is no fool. He can see through people. Despite all these things, I am pretty sure Mike will do anything to provide for his family. Of course, a parking ticket booth collector can't provide that can't kind of money. So, he will do what he does best.I am pretty sure that from next episode onward, we are gonna see the bond between Saul and Mike strengthening. Mike doing all of Saul's dirty work for the money.
