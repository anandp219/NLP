 I don't think so. Whatever Brody did for CIA (for Carrie), he was still a criminal in the eyes of American law. One right do not amend multiple wrongs (except in movies). Also, the whole mission was top secret and was actually planned to bring Javadi in power in Iran. Telling the world that Brody killed Akbari to help CIA would have probably blown up Javadi's cover. And then this whole operation would have gone down the drain.This is just one thing, the most important thing is that Lockhart was CIA chief when Brody was hanged. In fact, he (and Dar) was the one who sold Brody to Javadi and that was definitely a logical step to do. Lockhart never liked Brody and would have never publicized him, no matter what he had done.
