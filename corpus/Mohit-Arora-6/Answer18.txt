 It's definitely weird, and to some extent, desperate of Marv to seek help of Deeds to rob the bar. It was like the director was short of people to cast so they used a recurring character.But there can still be an explanation. Deeds was a kind of person who was not afraid of anyone or anything. He was a kind of person who doesn't think twice before doing anything. And Marv needed such a person to stand against the Chechen mob.He might have thought that no other goon will help him as they were all probably afraid of Chovka. Also, Deeds was supposed to have an excellent street cred as he killed the "Glory Days". He was supposed to be the tough guy who kills someone and talks about it as if he is having a conversation about Cricket with someone.It might be possible that Marv already had plans for Deeds. May be Marv had planned to kill Deeds after he robs the bar.
