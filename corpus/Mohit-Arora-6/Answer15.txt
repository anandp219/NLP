 Mike was always going to be the second lead on the show. I am not sure if there will be any more "breaking bad" characters in the show and whether they will take the lead roles or not but Mike had a pretty strong character in breaking bad so it was only fair that he would have gotten an equally important role in "Better Call Saul".I think Chuck's story was limited to letting people know the past of Saul aka Jimmy. There might be a tad bit more of it but I don't think he is gonna play a major role in the coming episodes and seasons.
