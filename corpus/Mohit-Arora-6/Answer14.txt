 To answer the question, she called them "after" finding the money. But finding the money was not the reason to call the cops.She told Mike that she found the money in the suitcase while unpacking. She obviously shifted to ABQ after Matty's death and while unpacking she found the money. She might not have given much thought to it then, as she was grieving. Or even though she might have found this suspicious she might have decided not to think about it that much as her husband was already gone.The reason she called the cops was the death of Hoffman and Fensky. Remember, Mike left Philadelphia the next day after he killed those cops. And now he is working in Albuquerque for at least some time. The daughter-in-law didn't get to know about the deaths right away (Mike didn't tell her when she took him home when he arrived in ABQ). She might have got to know about this through some old neighbors or acquaintance in ABQ. As soon as she got to know about this she called the PD inquiring about the case.May be they were already looking for Mike to take his statement about the cold blooded murder of the two cops, and didn't know that he was in Albuquerque (which is very strange considering that he is working in a government office). While talking to the PD she might have mentioned that Mike is also here. So they came by. She also might have thought that mentioning the money and her thoughts about her husband's character might also help the PD to look for the murderers.While talking to Mike she said "Yeah, I called them to help catch Matty's killers. What if the same person who got Matty, got them too?". This indicates that she called them when she heard about the shooting of the two cops and knowing about the money was not the main reason to call the PD.
