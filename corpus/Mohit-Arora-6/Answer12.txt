 In our college project we used the HMM (Hidden Markov Model) algorithm to train a model to detect credit card frauds.The model is first trained with a certain number of past transactions by the customer and the probability of that observation sequence is calculated by using HMM. When the user makes a new transaction, that transaction is added to the previous observation sequence and the probability of the new observation sequence is calculated. If the difference between the two probabilities is less than the threshold value then that transaction is accepted as a genuine transaction else it is tagged as fraudulent transaction and the customer is notified about it.But there were a lot of loopholes in this approach and we had to make a lot of assumptions. Even though they were calculated assumptions and we did some research and also gathered data from other research papers but in the end they were just assumptions and they highly increases the risk to use such a model in real life scenarios.For example, the biggest problem we faced was to set the "threshold value" below which the transaction can be accepted as a genuine one. In real life scenarios, you will need the data of thousands of customers in order to guess such a threshold value and even after that you cannot be completely sure that your model will work.
