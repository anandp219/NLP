 No. Neutron stars are not considered exotic matter, since they are made up of (mostly) neutrons, which are pretty ordinary matter, and anything but exotic.Exotic particles (which form exotic matter) are theorized particles which are predicted by different theories in Physics, but have not been observed, neither in Labs nor in the Universe, yet.The neutrons in the neutron stars are normal ordinary neutrons that are everywhere around (and inside every one of) us. There is nothing exotic about them.
