 I hope you are talking about the specific topic in which you want to do your PhD in, and not a general subject like Physics or Literature.In the case of topic, the best way to know about the topics is to attend several seminars by people, see what they are working on, read through the corresponding research papers, and see if that interests you. Alternatively, you can go through profiles of researchers on their websites and read through their work, their papers etc. to find the topics of your interests.But if you are talking about a general subject, then you're really on your own, and have to make up your mind. The choice would be easier if the two subjects you are interested in are similar to each other, as you can chose either without much thought and shift at any point. The further apart from each other the subjects are, the more difficult the decision will be, and you will have to select one, to go ahead. There are no guidelines for this, as this will be completely your personal decision.
