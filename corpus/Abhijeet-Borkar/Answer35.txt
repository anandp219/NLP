 The naming convention of the active galactic nuclei was developed by observational astronomers from empirical evidence. Thus their definition completely depend upon their observational properties.In case of the radio loud AGNs, they were defined by their "loudness", i.e. the ratio between the radio (5 GHz) to optical (B-band) flux. If this ratio is greater than 10, the AGN is considered as radio-loud. Otherwise it is considered as radio quiet AGN. There are several properties that differ between radio loud and radio quiet galaxies, but the main, defining characteristic is the ratio of radio to optical flux.Of course, studies of the AGNs over the years have resulted in a unification of the phenomenology of the AGNs. We have now understood how the different types of AGNs are manifestation of similar AGNs seen from different observational perspectives. But the taxonomy, developed from the first observation days has stuck.The detailed schematics of AGNs can be found easily, for example here: http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/leve...
