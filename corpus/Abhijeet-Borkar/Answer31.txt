 I have not read the mentioned novel, but as I have been asked to answer, I will give my two cents.It is true that the insterstellar medium is very rare (less dense) and diffuse. But if the solar system is to pass through a nebula, certain sections of that nebula can be very dense, as these sections eventually collapse under gravitation to form very dense stars and planets. So it is possible that if the solar system is moving through a nebula, then it is theoretically possible to encounter such a dense cloud.
