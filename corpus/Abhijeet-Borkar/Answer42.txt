 I'd recommend one book which gives a very good overview of Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A) for everyone, and especially to young children who are interested. A Cosmic Adventure  by J. V. Narlikar (original Marathi titled   ).The book gives a great overview of Astronomy from scratch up to cosmology, with great explanation of different phenomena, several amazing illustrations and images, very friendly writing, and yet does not shy away from technicalities and gives full account of the scientific background. I think it is the best book for any one to get acquainted with A&A.Other interesting (non-fiction) books I have read as a teenager were:A view from a height - Isaav Asimov (recommended)A brief history of time - Stephen Hawkings (not recommended, for various reasons, especially to a teenager).Great Physicists - William H. Cropper (highly recommended)Mad about Physics, and Mad about Modern Physics - Christopher Jargodzki and Franklin Potter (a set of quirky problems in physics with detailed solutions at the back)Yes, some of the books I mentioned are about Physics, rather than A&A, but a knowledge of physics is necessary for anyone to have good grasp of A&A
