 Apart from what has been written, one thing I can suggest is to invite more people to follow the blog. That is the best way to make the blog visible to people.Even though there is the option of promote, it doesn't really reach people. Earlier there used to be a separate feed for posts but I think Quora has removed it, so there's no easy way for people to reach blogs. Upvotes of people to blog posts don't show up in the feeds the same way answers do. So reaching a wider audience is really difficult for blogs. The best way I can think of is simply inviting users to follow the blog. That way, at least people will be aware of the existence of the blog, whether they follow it or not. (Even though I have been fairly active on Quora for more than a year, I only came across this blog only recently.)I don't know much about the workings of the blog yet to provide any input for improving the selection procedure.
