 Statement 1: The Universe is expanding.Statement 2: Bodies are attracted by gravity.I don't see any logical argument that would make someone believe that Statement 1 + Statement 2 lead to the result that the Universe is revolving around something.There are two ways one can interpret the Result statement: 'The Universe is revolving around something'. One is that the Universe is revolving around something external to the Universe, but that itself is an illogical statement, as by Universe we mean the whole of space-time, and there is nothing outside of it for it to revolve around.The other way to interpret is that all objects in the Universe are revolving around something. There is no observational evidence, nor any theoretical reason at all for all the matter to be going around certain point.What we observe is that clusters and superclusters of galaxies are moving away from each other irrespective of the point of observation, while small objects such as stars & galaxies are bound to each other by gravity. These two phenomena are of different scales. The former is a large scale phenomenon dominant at the scale of hundreds of millions to billions of light years, while the latter is a smaller scale phenomenon.
