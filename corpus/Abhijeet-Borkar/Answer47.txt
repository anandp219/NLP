 Shark Week is an annual, week-long, program on Discovery channel, dedicated to Sharks. The program showcases many aspects of sharks but mainly involve fictional or scaremongering stories demonising sharks. Providing realistic information is not something that they indulge in, as it doesn't help TRP, nor does it go well with the image of sharks in the minds of the public as man-eating machines. As Logan Forbes said in her blog-post Shark Week & Jaws and Their Tragic Flaws:These films and television shows appeal to our baser fears, making a spectacle of the unpredictability and ferociousness of a shark encounter.This negative image of sharks in the public mind has lead to mass killing of millions of sharks. 100 million sharks are slaughtered every year thanks to deliberate culls, bycatch, and the shark fin trade.The best way to save the sharks is to educate people about the misconceptions that have been put forth by the TV/film media. For this reason the blogs Quorans Against Shark Finning and QASF Shark Week were started so as to inform people on Quora about the sharks, the misconceptions surrounding them, and what can be done to help save the sharks from extinction.The QASF Shark Week features daily informative videos and blog-posts to spread the right word about sharks during the same week as Discovery channel's Shark Week.
