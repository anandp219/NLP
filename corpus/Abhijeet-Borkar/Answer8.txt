 If your main interest is to remain in academia, and especially want to go for theoretical physics/theoretical Astrophysics, then taking pure mathematics as a minor would help out a lot. That way, learning the maths required for studying Quantum Field Theory, General Relativity, Cosmology and (if you intend to go down that route) theories for quantum gravity, would be much easier.If you plan to work in predominantly local astronomy/observational astronomy/simulations, then doing a computational course would be helpful.An under-appreciated, but much more important minor that will help you both inside and outside academia would be a minor in statistical methods. (also see the answers and comments to them here What math should a physics major learn?)Keeping in mind that you also want to keep the option of jobs outside academia, a minor related to computational physics, or computer science would also be good, as it will help you get a job in software/data science industry.
