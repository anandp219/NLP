 Gandalf did not actually have any plan in his mind at all, for the whole story of the Hobbit, neither in books, nor in the movies.In the whole story, Gandalf did not make any concrete plans whatsoever, he did not have any idea as to how to take out the infamous dragon, Smaug. He did not have any plan on reclaiming the Lonely Mountain. His only plan was to nudge the Dwarf-Lord Thorin to move his butt, rekindle the fire that had been idle, to take back Erebor, and accompany him with enough companions (including himself) to help him get this job done.The only reason I can think of as to why Gandalf told Thorin to wait outside and not enter the mountain without Gandalf is that he wanted to be there as a sensible head. Gandalf knew that Thorin was a hothead, and the gang of Dwarves can be at times, lets say unwise. And hence he wanted to be there to handle the delicate operations.But as to any concrete plans, I'm afraid he didn't have any.
