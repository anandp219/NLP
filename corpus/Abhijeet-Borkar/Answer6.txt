 Apart from what Gene Spafford and J. Lee Anthony have suggested, one of the best ways to gain research experience as undergrad is to apply for summer projects (short term projects) at other Universities apart from your home Uni. This is mostly feasible between the 3rd and 4th year of bachelor's degree in the American system and between bachelor's and master's as well as after 1st year of master's in 3 year BSc system. At this point, you have enough knowledge of basics of physics/astronomy that you can contribute to research, and learn at the same time.
