 One of my favourite Astronomy experiments, that got me completely hooked up to Astronomy, is the experiment to observe the Fraunhofer lines in the Solar Spectrum.For the experiment, you will need a standard prism table: Replace the prism in the middle with a diffraction grating (the grating resolves the spectrum significantly better than a prism does). Use a mirror to reflect the light from the sun to the collimator. The grating will diffract the light to give the whole visible spectrum of the Sun which can then be seen from the scope.If done correctly, you will be able to see the full spectrum of the Sun with all the absorption lines. With some calculations you can then identify which absorption line belongs to which element. Sodium, Gold, Magnesium etc are pretty easy to see.
