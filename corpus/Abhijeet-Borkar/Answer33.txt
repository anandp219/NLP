 This is a question a bit difficult answer, since black hole "discovery" isn't the same as detecting particles. Unlike detection of new particles, the detection of black holes was mostly a process of elimination of other alternative scenarios, thus the "discovery" only came with consensus from several studies & supporting theoretical papers.But to answer the question, the first BH "candidates" were discovered in late 60's and early 70's thanks to the new satellite technologies that allowed X-ray satellites in orbit, which observed several bright X-ray sources in the Milky Way, most prominently Cygnus-X.These observations led to the possibility of stellar mass black holes, on which there was a significant debate in the 80's as several other theories were proposed to explain away the BHs, such are Quark-stars or multiple star systems. The main reason for this was that the mass of these BH candidates was quite small and it could be explained by other models, and it was proposed that a detection of a system with more than [math] 5 M_{\odot} [/math] mass function would confirm the BH candidate.Eventually in 1989, V404 Cygni was detected whose mass was [math] > 6 M_{\odot} [/math], and that was the first confirmation of existence of stellar mass BHs. Since then several other candidates have been confirmed as stellar mass BHs.[reference: Page on cambridge.org]Similarly, supermassive BHs were detected at the centers of galaxies. They had been predicted for long (since the discoveries of active galactic nuclei & Quasars), but robust confirmations came only in the 90's (with e.g. Andromeda's central SMBH observed with the Hubble first estimates showed a BH with mass [math] 3 - 5 \times 10^7 M_{\odot} [/math], which was eventually corrected to be [math] 1 - 2.5 \times 10^8 M_{\odot} [/math]). The Milky Way's SMBH was also speculated for several years and was eventually confirmed in 2002, as I discuss it in my answer to Is it possible for there to be no significant mass inside of the super-massive black hole in the center of The Milky Way? As for the neutrinos, the direct detection happened in 1956 by Clyde Cowan, Frederick Reines, F. B. Harrison, H. W. Kruse, and A. D. McGuire.
