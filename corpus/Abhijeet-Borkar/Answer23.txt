 There are two types of Globular Clusters (GCs), the ones that orbit in the Galactic Halo, and the ones that orbit the center of the galaxy.Page on physics.mcmaster.ca gives a complete catalog of the globular clusters of the Milky Way. In that catalog, you can find several which are within 10 kpc from the center of the galaxy and are also within the 10 latitude (which would be considered as the disc of the galaxy).For example, at -8 galactic latitude and a distance of 6.6 kpc from the Sun, NGC 4833 sits well within the galactic plane that it is obscured by the dust in the galactic plane that lies between us and the cluster. So no, not all GCs are outside the Galaxy, though majority do lie outside the Galactic Plane.
