 The application procedure for PhD to European institutes is significantly different from applications to American institutes (or Indian for that matter). For US institutes, applications are done for the graduate school after completing a 4 yrs bachelor's degree, after which you've to take courses and qualifiers for 1-2 years. The process is similar in India as well, with the exception that you have to have a masters degree and be in the top 1-3% of the PhD entrance examinations. In comparison, most PhDs in Europe don't require you to take courses, and you start working on the PhD topic soon after joining. Thus the requirements for statement of purpose, and research interest need to be much more focused.I have written about the detailed application procedure for Ph.D. position in Europe on my blog here: Adventures of a Curious Mind.The most basic requirement you should have is that you must possess a master's degree in a relevant field related to the field you are applying to. So for example, if you are applying to a PhD in Astrophysics, you should have a master's degree in Astrophysics/Physics/Maths or closely related engineering degree (with good grasp of physics).The second requirement (usually) is that you should have completed a masters level (or equivalent) thesis/project in a relevant field. A previous research experience at the masters level is considered crucial.These are the real basics that you need, without which, it's really difficult to get PhD position.Other things you need for the application are:Your brief CV.2-3 recommendation letters from people you've worked with and who know you well.Research Interest, as in, what do you work on during your PhD.Statement of Purpose.After the submission, there will be a review of documents by the selection committee and the top candidates will be asked for an interview, of which, the promising ones will be selected for the PhD positions.
