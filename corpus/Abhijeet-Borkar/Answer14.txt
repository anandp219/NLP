 >> What are some things astronomers won't tell you?There is nothing that Astronomers have discovered but haven't made public. >> Like research results that would make you worry99% of the astronomers don't work on topics where the results might have immediate impact on daily life that they need to hide sensitive information. If astronomers find something, they publish it in scientific papers. Most of these papers (around 95%) are freely available for anyone to read on arXiv.org e-Print archive.>> or how uncertain they are about something?The uncertainties about their calculations, measurements and observations are available to be read in the papers. Calculating uncertainties are one of the most important aspects of performing scientific experiment. There are paragraphs after paragraphs written about the accuracy, and uncertainty of the data.And these all have to go through peer review from the magazine where the paper is published, as well as public review from the people who read the papers on arXiv. If there are any problems with the data, people would point it out.And given that careers of astronomers depend more and more on publishing results, people are more likely to bring out the papers as quickly as possible than sit on the data that might be challenging paradigm.
