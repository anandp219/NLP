 The Milky Way Galaxy (also called as the Galaxy) is a barred spiral galaxy which is host to 300 billion stars, including our own Sun, and the Solar system, which is located in its outskirts at a distance of 27,000 light years ([math]\sim 8 kpc [/math]) from the center in the Orion-Cygnus Arm. The Milky Way gets its name from its appearence in the night sky as a dim fuzzy glowing band stretching across the night sky.The Milky Way across the night sky, as seen from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, in Narrabri, Australia. (Image credit: Alex Cherney)It is made up of a disk of stars which is 100,000 light years in diameter, and only 1000 light years thick near the position of the Sun, decreasing away from the center. The disk contains most of the Milky Way's stars and all of its gas and dust, with the total mass of [math] 10^{11} M_{\odot} [/math]. The spiral arms are located in this disk and are traced by the molecular clouds. These arms are thought to have formed because of the density waves from the interaction between the stars and the gas in the disk orbiting the Galaxy. As the molecular clouds are home to massive star formation, the star clusters near the spiral arms have relatively young massive stars. The HII regions, illuminated by the massive young stars also run across the spiral arms. Periodic supernova explosions from the dying OB stars create expanding shells of material and fill the interstellar medium with hot ([math] \sim 10^6 K [/math]) X-ray emitting gas. The stars eventually disperse from their birth enviroment, and thus the disk contains a mix of young and old stars.Sketch of the structure of the Milky WayThe disk of the Galaxy is surrounded by a spherical halo of stars. This halo is sparsely populated and contains stars worth total mass of [math] \sim 10^9 M_{\odot} [/math] and virtually no gas and dust, and thus no star formation. Due to this, the halo stars are quite old and appear reddish in color. The small, spherical, densely packed globular clusters of about [math]10^5-10^6 [/math] stars contain about 1% of the halo stars. Some of the oldest stars in the Galaxy can be found in these 150 globular clusters. This halo of the stars and the Galaxy are embedded in the spherical dark matter halo extending for hundreds of kiloparsecs, which has a mass of [math] \sim 10^{12} M_{\odot} [/math]. Towards the center of the Galaxy is the flattened, elongated collection of stars known as the Galactic Bulge. The bulge stars away from the center are older. They have highly elliptical orbits, with largely random inclinations, although their average stellar motion is net rotation around the Galactic center. The center also contains a faint bar of the length of 1 - 5 kpc. The nature of the bar is highly debated, with suggestions of a single bar, triaxial bulge, or two distinct nested bars. At the very center of the Galaxy lies a supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) with a mass of 4 million solar masses.
