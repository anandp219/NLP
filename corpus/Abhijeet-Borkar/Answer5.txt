 The discovery of briny water on Mars tells exactly what it says: there is briny moisture on the Martian surface.It was known that there was flowing water on the Mars few billion years ago and there's solid ice at the poles, but the new discovery means that there is some liquid water in very small quantities on its surface.This is not helpful in any significant way for the human missions to Mars, nor does it mean you can grow vegetables there.What it does mean is that there can be a possibility of indigenous microbial life along the region where the moisture is found, whether ancient or currently thriving.
