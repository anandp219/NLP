 There is no official translation of the Hobbit or the Lord of the Rings in Hindi.The only Indian language which has the translation of both is Marathi (where both the books have been translated, by different translators). The Hobbit is also translated in Bengali. Unfortunately, I have not read the Marathi translations yet (and I cannot read/speak Bengali). I do not know how good or bad the translations are but my fear is that they would be very juvenile or simplistic and won't be able to give justice to the complexity of the themes that Tolkien wanted to convey. I have seen few short excerpts of the books and I am deeply dissatisfied at the style of translation, and since they currently cost almost 2-3 times more than the original English books in India, I have no interest in spending that much money on them just to find out how good or bad they are, so I am waiting to go back home so I can go through the books from a library or borrow it from someone to have a better perspective.
