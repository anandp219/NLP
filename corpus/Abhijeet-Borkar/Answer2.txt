 The supermassive black holes are found only at the centers of the galaxies. There is significant proof that there is a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way (Is it possible for there to be no significant mass inside of the super-massive black hole in the center of The Milky Way?). It is also thought that most galaxies contain SMBH at their centers (Is there a black hole at the center of every galaxy?). Of course there are some galaxies which do not contain SMBH at their centers (Which galaxies are known not to possess a supermassive black hole near their center?). The important question is Why should the center of a galaxy contain a supermassive blackhole? Unfortunately, we don't know the answer that question.
