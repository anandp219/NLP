 This answer is based on my memory of watching the directors' commentary in the extebded edition of the LotR movies,which I have seen a long time ago. The details might be sketchy or incorrect so correct me if I am wrong.Before getting the job, Peter Jackson (PJ) had not read the book. He tried to read it in his youth, but got bored and left it. Only after he got the job that he read the books completely.But he also had assistance, as they also had in-house "experts" such as Philippa Boyence and Fran Walsh, who wrote the screenplay for the movies. Both of these were LotR fans from childhood.Since getting the job, PJ has read the books multiple times and has enough grasp of the significance of the material.
