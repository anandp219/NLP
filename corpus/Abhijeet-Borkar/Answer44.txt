 Given your requirements I suggest following:1. If you are enrolled in the University of Cologne, then you should be able to apply for university hostel (Studentenwerk). The costs vary but are of the order of 200 euro for the rent (inclusive).2. If you cannot get into hostel, then you will have to look for apartments in the city. Since you need studio apartment, it will be more difficult. The (exclusive) rent for studio apartments is about 11  per sq. m. so depending on the size of your room, the (inclusive) rent may vary from 350 to 600.On top of it, your expenses would be around 150 per month, if you cook at home. The expenses would rise significantly if you do these:Eating in restaurants regularly (5-10 per meal for cheap places, 15-30 for proper restaurants)Drinking SmokingRecreational activities (movies, outing etc)If you are student of the public University, you can travel in the whole NRW state for free with all modes of transport (buses, trains, trams etc) except superfast trains (IC, ICE, EuroRail). If not, then the transport gets very expensive (~ 100 for Cologne city ticket for 1 month).So depending upon your background, and luck, your monthly expenses would be ~ 400-700 per month minimum.
