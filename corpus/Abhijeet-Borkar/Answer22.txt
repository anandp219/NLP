 There are several galaxies known to not host supermassive black holes (SMBH) in their centers. These are mainly the dwarf galaxies, which are too small to host any SMBH. Some of these may contain intermediate mass black holes, but there haven't been robust detection of such.Others are galaxies whose SMBHs have been kicked out of the galaxy during a merger/collision event. There are several such galaxies that are known to have either a displaced SMBH or completely ejected. It is one of the hot topics of research to study the effects of such SMBH kicks on the galaxy evolution, star formation rate etc.
