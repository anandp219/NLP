 For the risk of attracting undue attention, Gandalf provided just too much in terms of wisdom, knowledge and guidance for the Ringbearer and the Fellowship that he was indispensable.An Elf-Lord provided something similar to what Legolas, a strong, skilled warrior and a team player, with leadership skills similar to Aragorn. But there were very few Elf-Lords left who could even try to match Gandalf in knowledge, lore and wisdom. May be Elrond, Galadriel and Cirdan could, but they would never travel with the Fellowship.Gandalf, on the other hand, was the most experienced traveller East of the Great Sea, having travelled North and South and West and East, visited many lands and made many friends that would come to his help, knew the lands and the peoples well enough to broker deals, leverage the advantage for the Fellowship. And yet he remained a humble old man. That made him look less threatening and less alien than an Elf-lord to the humans around the continent.What Gandalf brought to the table was much more than any living Elf-Lord, even Galadriel herself, could bring.
