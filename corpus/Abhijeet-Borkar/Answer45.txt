 Thanks for A2A Thomas. Ernest W. Adams has answered it completely, and I will mostly reiterate him.There is really no reason to assume that Sauron would have betrayed Morgoth.After the second defeat of Morgoth, and destruction of Utumno, when Morgoth was captured and chained in the Halls of Mandos, Sauron remained loyal to him, and remained hidden in Angband even though he could have repented then and gone back in the service of Aule. He didn't.During the War of the Jewels, Sauron was probably responsible for a lot of destruction under Melkor, including death of Finrod Felagund. He commanded armies against the Noldor in battles, which all turned out pretty well in favour of the Dark Lord. If he wanted to betray, I'd imagine a different result of Nirtnaeth Arnoediad would have been the best place for him to do so. But he didn't.Even in Second and Third Age, when he declared himself the Dark Lord, he was acting as a deputy in-charge in the absence of Melkor. He knew who the ultimate Dark Lord was, and this is clear from his building of Temple for Melkor.Under Melkor, Sauron was given enough freedom to pursue his own style, experiments and lead the armies as a commander, as Melkor no longer came out for open war. Thus Sauron was Melkor's right hand, as well as de facto leader of the armies. I'm pretty sure he was very content with his position.There is no reason to assume he would undercut or betray his boss, under whom he had all the freedom in the world, and ultimate job satisfaction.
