 Off the top of my head these are the ones that are "serious open problems":What is Dark Matter made up of? What are its effects apart from gravity? Given how well the Lambda-CDM model works, these questions become prominent.What is dark energy? We know little about this.Formation of first black holes. This is my favourite topic. There are few theoretical explanations but observational evidence is not available. Hopefully with the next gen telescopes we should be able to answer this.I will keep adding more as I remember them
