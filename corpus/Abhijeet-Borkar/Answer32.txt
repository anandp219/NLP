 It was one of the best evening I had! It was amazing to finally meet some of the people I have interacted with here on Quora for a long time, and get introduced to several more people with whom I had not come across before!It was a very exciting day. I caught up with Lorenzo Peroni and Joachim Pense earlier during the day near Kreuzberg (where just moments before meeting the two, my wallet was almost stolen. I caught the thief in action :D). We walked around the city center, had lunch together, and then walked some more through the parks. There Clarissa found us wandering on the streets, after which we had some drinks together and we discussed (well I listened with my inadequate German) linguistics, not realising that the meetup was at 1830, so we arrived 'fashionably late' (as Lorenzo liked to call it).At the Vietnamese restaurant, it was amazing to finally meet all the people whom I had known only as thumbnails attached to answers on Quora. we had a great time together, and we talked about so many different things, from linguistics to black holes to human rights to Indian Upvote Lottery to banking softwares! It was great to meet all the wonderful people Nadeesha, Yves, Louis, Tilman, Jerzy, Ralph, Eivind and his wife. Unfortunately, since we were divided on two separate tables (and I was too engrossed in eating my delicious Vietnamese food and drinking beer to hop over to other table) that I didn't get time to talk to all the people and I could only say hello to John Grantham, Stefania Delprete, and Judith Meyer.After the dinner, when almost everyone had left, Ralph, Tilman and I went for another round of beers at a quite pub near Volksbhne, and had great discussion about physics, Higgs boson and Medieval warfare! But as the pub close and a few drops of rain started falling we had to call it a night!Edit: I don't have any photos from the meetup so here's a photo of Potsdamer Platz that I took on the evening before.
