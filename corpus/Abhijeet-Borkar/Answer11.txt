 There are different types of radiation coming from Jupiter:>> Any object, which has a temperature above the absolute zero (which means each and every material object in the Universe) will radiate energy that is proportional to the fourth power of their absolute temperature ([math]\propto T^4[/math], Stefan-Boltzmann Law). This radiation is known as the blackbody radiation. The power emitted per unit area per unit frequency is given by the Plancks law:[math]
B(\nu,T) = \frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_{B}T} - 1}
[/math]The blackbody radiation curve look like this:[Image: http://astronomy.swin.edu.au]This is one of origins of the intrinsic radiation from planets, including Jupiter. For Jupiter, since it is very cold, at -145 C, it will radiate mostly in microwave and radio wavelengths.>> Jupiter also reflects the light coming from the Sun, which is another source of Jupiter's radiation.>> The other forms of radiation comes from what is known as "line emission", which is the emission arising from the transition of electrons from atomic and molecular levels by absorbing/emitting photons. Several different lines have been found from the atmosphere of Jupiter, for example Discovery of 3-micron line emission from south polar CH4, C2H2, and C2H6.
