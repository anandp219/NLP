 A flash of light for a short moment, and then obliteration.Supernova is not a star, but an event a star goes through at the end of its life. By the time a star reaches a stage of supernova, it probably will have engulfed all the planets around it. Even if there are any remaining planets, they will all be obliterated, shred into pieces and flung across the galaxy by the supernova explosion. A supernova at a distance of 1 AU (distance between Sun & Earth) is 9 orders of magnitude brighter than a hydrogen bomb that detonates in your face. It is that energetic.So unless your sentient immortal being has forsaken any material form and become transcendental being made up of pure energy, it has no chance of surviving that, as the supernova releases enough energy in 1 second that it outshines the whole of galaxy, with its material flung across in the space at speed close to the speed of light.You can read more details about the procedure here on the blogpost The nature of the Supernova by Mark Savchuk on Elements of Life
