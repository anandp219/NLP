 Firstly it seems like the OP has a misconception that the black holes (BHs) at the centers of the galaxies are stellar mass black holes (re: question details about white dwarfs). The BHs at the centers of the galaxies are all super massive black holes (SMBHs), with the mass between [math]10^6 - 10^{10} M_{\odot}[/math], while the stellar mass BHs have a mass of [math] 1 - 2 M_{\odot}[/math]. White dwarfs are too tiny to be of any significance in the galaxy structure formation & evolution.There are evidences of galaxies without SMBHs. Most of such galaxies are smaller galaxies and dwarf galaxies. Among the large galaxies, there are evidences of galaxies without central SMBHs. These are the galaxies where the central BHs have been kicked out of the galaxy during a merger recoil with another galaxy.There have been several observations of recoiling BHs in the merging galaxies, where SMBHs which have been kicked from their host galaxies have been detected. (Some of these can be found with a simple ADS Query).
