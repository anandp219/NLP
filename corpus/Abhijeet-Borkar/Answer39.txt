 No. A super massive black hole has a mass of [math]\sim 10^6 - 10^{10} M_{\odot}[/math] which is less than the mass of a normal galaxy. This is not enough to attract galactic clusters towards it.As I have mentioned it in my answer to Could the Milky Way be heading towards an ultra-massive black hole without us knowing it? the main reason for the apparent "mystery" of the Great Attractor is that it lies in the Zone of Avoidance, which is directly behind the Milky Way as seen from Earth. If we had a clear line of sight, there would not be any mystery at all.Another problem with the "Ultra-Massive Black Hole" as the explanation for the Great Attractor is that there is no evidence for an Ultra Massive BH ([math]\sim 10^{13} M_{\odot}[/math] anywhere in the Universe. So there is no reason to think that there would be one in our neighbourhood. A massive super-cluster of galaxies, with contribution from both the baryonic & dark matter to the mass of the cluster can easily account for the required gravitation for the Great Attractor, and hence is a better candidate than an Ultra-massive BH.
