 Yes the galaxies are randomly oriented and there is no prevalence of any sorts. The orientation of galaxies purely dependent on our position in the space (Earth/solar system). We do not find any specific direction to be favoured. (if we did, that would be a massive massive discovery, and a blow to many major theories).We can see this from the orientation of AGNs that we have observed for decades. During first several years, we observed several different types of AGNs. The Blazars, the Narrow line AGNs, Broad line AGNs, Seyferts, Quasars etc. [Image: Page on cta-observatory.ac.uk]Now we have understood that we see these various types mainly because of how we see the AGN as it is oriented towards us. This diagram illustrates this perfectly, how different AGNs are observed as different orientation of the AGN as seen from Earth.Since in the last few decades we have observed several thousands of the AGNs (more? I don't know. I haven't counted them), and we see no particular bias towards any of the type of AGN. So it is safe to conclude that they are all oriented randomly.
