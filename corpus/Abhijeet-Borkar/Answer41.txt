 I get asked about this regularly and I have written a detailed post about application for a PhD program to Germany (and Europe in general) on my personal blog (Applying for PhD in Europe). I will give a shorter version of it here, and you can read details in the blog-post.Selecting the topic: The first step is to decide which topic you want to work on. You should have a clear idea about which subject, as well as the sub-topic you want to work on. Not having any clue about what you want to work on does not make a positive impact in your application.In the application following things are required:A brief, concise curriculum vitae, which should contain objective information about your academic career.Statement of Purpose where you are expected to describe your broad aims during your Ph.D.Research interest: Specific details about the topics you want to work on.Letters of recommendationThese are the basics that are expected from you for the admission process. Any other details would depend on the specific place you are applying to.
