 Wow.. This is an interesting question! What really can we do as Quollaboration?As Tara has mentioned, most of the low hanging fruits have already been picked, and I wouldn't want to add into already large number of wikis and fanpages available.One of the things that can be done easily (that doesn't require too much effort/time investment) is to create & curate an ebook, with all the great Questions & Answers from Quora.The Q&A here go further beyond than the usual "wiki" format. They delve deep into literature, philosophy, ethics and theology. There is equal opportunity for creativity and academic rigor, that makes reading an Answer on Quora much more fun than reading dry-third person account of wikis.So I would love to have all the great Q&As on Quora to be collected together, curated regularly, and made available to readers.
