 The name of the newly discovered object is given by the person/team who has discovered it, and it is done along with the publication of the discovery of the object. Thus whoever discovered the new planet gets to name it. They might name it something different & interesting, or they might name it something generic. If the planet is of extreme significance, the International Astronomical Union might step in to give it a fitting name, or the public may adopt some name of their liking.But the person who is selected to land there would probably be the last person in the list to get the honour to name the planet.And to answer the other part of the question, I would not be selected for this, as I am not USofA citizen.
