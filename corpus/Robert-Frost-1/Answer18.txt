 The story doesn't explicitly say. Dickens wrote the story in 1842-1843 and it was published for the 1843 Christmas season. The only mention of time in the story is when Scrooge asks the Ghost of Christmas Present "Have you had many brothers, Spirit? and the Ghost responds More than eighteen hundred." Since we know there is a new Ghost of Christmas Present each year, we know the story takes place more than 1800 years after the birth of Christ.The easiest assumption is to assume the story takes place on Christmas Eve 1843. But, the epilogue narration tells us:"Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world."That leaves us to either assume the omniscient narrator is referring to the future or the story takes place far enough in the past that Ebenezer could become a better man before the story was told.
