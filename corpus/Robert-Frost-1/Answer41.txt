 I used to give tours of NASA to groups such as the kids from the Kansas Cosmosphere. I would tell them that the one thing the movie Armageddon got correct was the chairs. The flight controllers sit in the same kind of chairs in the movie as in real life.That's pretty much it.To be fair, they did film a scene in our pool, the NBL (Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory). In that scene, Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis are wearing real multimillion dollar spacesuits. They also filmed scenes at our vacuum chamber, on the launchpad, and in our hangar. So, there are some accurate locales.But, cosmonauts do not beat on equipment with lead pipes, there are no titanium Space Shuttles, the Orbiter cannot land on or launch from an asteroid, Mir was not spin stabilized, and the MCC is over 900 miles from the launchpad, so Billy Bob Thornton cannot, especially wearing a leg brace, walk from one to the other in minutes. There are no asteroids in the solar system that are that big.I cannot confirm or deny whether Liv Tyler actually keeps Animal Crackers in her panties.
