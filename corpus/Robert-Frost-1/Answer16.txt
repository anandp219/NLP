 They aren't painted white. There are a variety of colored surfaces, each functional.Most of the module surfaces are metallic. In the below picture we can see many metal panels. Those are meteor shields. Below those shields are thermal blankets and below the blankets is an aluminum hull.Most of the areas that appear white are not paint, but exposed thermal blanket (AKA beta cloth). Look closely at this picture and you can see the fabric. The beta cloth is white because white reflects heat.There are some surfaces and boxes with a white coating. That coating is white, again for thermal reasons. There are also some boxes with a black coating, also for thermal reasons. Those are boxes that we don't want to get cold.
