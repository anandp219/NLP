 More than two dozen. From the 1901 silent film called Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost to the 2009 full CGI 3D Jim Carrey version, A Christmas Carol is adapted for film, television, and stage perennially.I believe that the best version is the 1984 version, starring George C. Scott, David Warner, Susannah York, Roger Rees, and Edward Woodward. In addition to the strong performances from such a stellar cast, it is the version that I believe is most true both to the spirit and the setting of the film. Every year, I read the book, see the play, and watch this version. I can almost recite it from memory.An Incomplete List of Film Adaptations of A Christmas Carol1901 Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost1910 A Christmas Carol1935 Scrooge1938 A Christmas Carol1949 The Christmas Carol1951 Scrooge1953 It's Never Too Late1954 A Christmas Carol1956 The Stingiest Man in Town1969 A Christmas Carol1970 Scrooge1971 A Christmas Carol Animated1978 A Christmas Carol1979 An American Christmas Carol1983 Mickey's Christmas Carol1984 A Christmas Carol1986 A Christmas Carol1988 Scrooged1992 The Muppet Christmas Carol1998 Ebenezer1999 A Christmas Carol2000 A Christmas Carol2001 Christmas Carol: The Movie2005 Chasing Christmas2009 A Christmas Carol2012 A Christmas CarolIf that looks like a lot of films, that list would be absolutely dwarfed by the number of episodes of television series that adapt A Christmas Carol. Everything from The Twilight Zone to Blackadder to Beavis & Butthead has put their spin on the classic story. It is such a perfect story that everyone wants to tell it.
