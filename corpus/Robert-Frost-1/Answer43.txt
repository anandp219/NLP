 Yes. An object floating in the vacuum of space may not have air to convect its heat away, it may not be touching an object through which it can conduct its heat away, but it can still utilize the third heat transfer mechanism - it can radiate its heat.The temperature of an object in space can vary greatly depending on whether it is in sunlight or darkness. In sunlight, radiation can not outpace the influx of energy from the Sun, but in darkness radiation will leak heat away.Let's use the Moon, as an example. The Moon is simply a rock, floating in space. On the day side, it can heat up to 253 F (123 C). On the night side it radiates that heat and gets down to -387 F (-233 C).
