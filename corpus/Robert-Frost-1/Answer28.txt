 I can't imagine any other actor portraying Steve Rogers and Captain America with such verisimilitude.From the his first scene, we can see the determination, goodness, and spirit in the scrawny kid from Brooklyn. When Dr. Erskine says to Steve, "The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.""Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you must stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man."We buy it, because Evans has so convinced us that this kid is the right person to become Captain America.And then we see Steve step out of the chamber, transformed and bare chested. Evans has the physicality that looks like he stepped out of the comic book page.Evans brings Cap's earnestness, sadness, integrity, and bravery to life without a hint of irony or cheese.
