 If an actor starves themselves for months and becomes emaciated, for a single scene, they sure as hell aren't going to have a towel over their head for that scene. They are going to make sure you know it is them.The Martian was filmed on a very short schedule. There wasn't time for a hiatus while the lead actor starved himself.Matt may have been willing to lose weight for the role, but he's in his forties now. It would be a lot harder than it was when he did it for Courage Under Fire. Doing it for that film seriously affected his health. He was on medication for 18 months because of the damage caused to his adrenal system.
