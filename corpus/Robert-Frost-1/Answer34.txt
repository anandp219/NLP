 Because the Marvel Cinematic Universe is inspired by the Marvel Comics Universe, and in the comics, more money can be made by going with choice (A) than choice (B).Choice A: sell the following comics each month:Iron ManCaptain AmericaThorBlack WidowHawkeyeIncredible HulkThe AvengersChoice B: sell the following comics each month:The AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersI believe the same would apply to the films.This is a very common question from people that aren't more than casual comic book fans. They often ask things like"Why didn't Iron Man help Captain America when SHIELD was after him in Captain America: The Winter Soldier?" or "Why didn't the Avengers help Spider-man save New York in Spider-Island?" The answer is "Because it's not their &@$*ing movie/comic!"If every time Batman got into trouble, he called Superman, Wonder Woman, or the Flash to bail him out, Batman would cease to be an interesting hero. The title character needs to be the hero of their title.It's not about reality, it's about telling good stories.
