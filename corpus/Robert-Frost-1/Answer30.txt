 There are two wolves who are always fighting.One is darkness and despair.The other is light and hope.The question is: which wolf wins?The one you feed.Casey learned that old Indian legend from her father. She repeats it throughout the film. It is the central idea of the story. She and Athena are driven by that idea. Young Frank was, but adult Frank has started to feed the wrong wolf and Casey has to bring him back. Nix has been corrupted by his obsession with the wrong wolf.If we want a bright future, we have to see a bright future. We have to feed that future. The film has a couple of small jokes about movies with apocalyptic titles. The film isn't saying that such movies are bad, but it is saying that if all of our visions of the future are dystopian, how can we expect a future that isn't dystopian? We need to see the future we want - we need to see Tomorrowland.The film is about optimism and the wonderful things we can do, if we believe we can do them. There's a common refrain about the present in which people say "Where are the jetpacks and flying cars we were promised?" In the film, young Frank says "I got tired of waiting for my jetpack, so I built one."Walt Disney believed in projecting the future he wanted to see. He built Tomorrowland, at Disneyland, to be an exciting, positive view of what can be. Walt's dream, was to actually build the city of the future. He bought all of that land in Florida not just to build Disneyworld but to build a city called EPCOT (Experimental Protoype City of Tomorrow). At the center of that city would be research facilities for all of the major companies in America. It would be a city dedicated to the future. Unfortunately Walt died before ground was broken and the project faded away.
