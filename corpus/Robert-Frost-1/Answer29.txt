 In the book, Mark takes up about half a page explaining what happened to his suit. That would be pure gobbledygook on the screen. Everyone in the audience saw Mark get hit by the antenna. Everyone in the audience saw that he was impaled by part of the antenna. Everyone in the audience can figure out that an impaled spacesuit leaks. No explanation was needed by going with the simplest explanation. It didn't change the story at all. It would have been silly to go with the same explanation as used in the novel.As for accuracy in the book, spacesuits with oxygenators like the one in the book don't exist. Yet.
