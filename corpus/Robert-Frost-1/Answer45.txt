 Because that is the only way to remain above one spot on the Earth.A geostationary orbit is one in which the period of the satellite is one day. A geosynchronous orbit is one in which the period of the satellite is one day.The difference between the two is inclination. A geostationary satellite has an inclination of zero degrees. That means it is over the equator. The satellite is always over the equator and has a period equal to the rotation rate of the Earth, so the satellite appears to float over one spot. But, now imagine that the satellite orbit is incline about 30 degrees, like in the picture, above. After 6 hours, the satellite will not be over a spot on the equator, it will be one a spot 30 degrees north of the equator. It will return to that spot on the equator, once per day, but it won't stay there.That means it is synchronous - which means occurring at the same time, and not stationary - which means staying in the same place.
