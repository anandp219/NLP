 Not sure where you got the idea that 17 km/s is the escape velocity of the solar system. The escape velocity decreased with distance as depicted in the above graph.The above graph also illustrates the gravity assists that Voyager 2 did at each gas planet. Voyager's mission was to visit each of those planets. In order to do so, it had to be be at the same location as each planet as Voyager moved outwards. That means very precise velocities were required. If Voyager had been significantly faster at Jupiter, it would never have approached Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune.
