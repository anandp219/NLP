 I listen to:Doctor Who: Radio Free SkaroDoctor Who: PodshockDoctor Who: The Impossible GirlsWhos Talking: A Doctor Who PodcastMy preference for them is in that order. Radio Free Skaro is run by three Canadian guys. They are long-time Whovians and participate in Who conventions. It's the most professional of the four podcasts. Podshock is an American guy and a British guy. The Impossible Girls is interesting because it is all female. They often see the episodes from a very different perspective than I do. The downside is that a few of them have very annoying speech patterns, including chronic use of "like".
