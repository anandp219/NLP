 The Apollo vehicles all crossed the Van Allen radiation belts in order to get to the Moon. The trajectory was designed to bypass the most hazardous parts of the belts and to spend as little time as possible in the belts, but they certainly did get past them. The Moon is more than six times as far way as the outer border of the Van Allen belts.Apollo 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 all crossed the Van Allen belts, twice.If the question is in response to the snarky video on Youtube, ignore the snarky text balloons put there by the reposter and just listen to the narrator. At no time during the video does he say NASA can't get past the Van Allen Belts.
