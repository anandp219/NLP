 Why can't you play Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 on a Casio keyboard while driving a Maybach Exelero on the Autobahn?It's &$%^*ing hard and $%^$%*ing expensive.Building an underground base, anywhere, even on Earth is hard and expensive. It requires large specialized equipment and skilled workers. To build one on Mars, we'd have to transport that equipment to Mars. We would have to transport the skilled workers to Mars. We would have to adapt the equipment to work in the Martian environment. In order to do all of that, we would first have to establish an above ground base on Mars to provide the infrastructure needed for the project. Such a thing would be a massive undertaking.We aren't even ready to send a human to Mars. It was a major technological challenge just to put the Mars Curiosity Rover safely on the surface.Imagine if we wanted to use something like the drill that was used to dig the Chunnel between England and France.Today, there is not a rocket available that could transport such a thing to Mars. We would need a fleet of rockets to transport the fuel for such a thing.To do such a thing, we would have to cancel at least one war in the Middle East.
