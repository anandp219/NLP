 The first recorded mention of geostationary orbit was in a letter written by science fiction author, Arthur C. Clarke, to Wireless World magazine, in February, 1945. Clarke wrote:"An "artificial satellite" at the correct distance from the Earth would make one revolution every 24 hours; i.e., it would remain stationary above the same spot and would be within optical range of nearly half the Earth's surface. Three repeater stations, 120 degrees apart in the correct orbit, could give television and microwave coverage to the entire planet."Clarke also said such a thing was probably half a century away. In fact, the first geostationary satellite was launched 19 years after Clarke wrote the letter. Today, some people call a geostationary orbit a Clarke orbit, in his honour.I don't know how necessary Clarke's letter was to the team that launched that satellite. Clarke's idea wasn't revolutionary or unintuitive - it comes right out of Newton's interpretation of Kepler's Third law. It is pretty natural that someone looking at that question and wanting to optimize the usable amount of time for their satellite would solve the equation for a 24 hour period and determine the magic altitude.Rearrange that equation to solve for the radius of the orbit...We know the values of G,M, and T. Put those in and we get a radius of 42,164 km. Subtract the radius of the Earth (6378 km) and we get a height of 35,786 km.Put a satellite 35,786 km above the Earth's surface, at the equator, and its orbital period will be exactly one day - meaning it will appear fixed in the sky.
