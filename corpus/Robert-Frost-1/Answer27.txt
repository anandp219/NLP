 The special, titled The Day of the Doctor, was simulcast in 94 countries across six continents, in 15 languages. While that has been done for realtime events like the World Cup, it had never been done for a television drama.The special was also shown live in 1500 cinemas. I had the pleasure of being at the largest single gathering of fans to watch it. 2200 of us congregated in one room to watch it live at Austin Comic Con.That's not the only Guinness World Record that Doctor Who holds. It was also recently recorded as the longest running sci-fi series.
