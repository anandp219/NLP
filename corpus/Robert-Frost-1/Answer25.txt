 The last twenty minutes of the film were all about trying to match the velocity and position of the Hermes with the velocity and position of the MAV. The crew of the Hermes had to go to extreme lengths to try to get themselves closer to the MAV.The MAV was designed to transport the crew from the Martian surface to Mars orbit where it would rendezvous with the Hermes. The problem during the last twenty minutes of the film is that the trajectory that returned the Hermes to Mars was not low or slow enough for the MAV to reach. The Hermes was not entering a parking orbit, it was doing a high speed loop around Mars and then back to Earth.Therefore, the objective on the ground was for Watney to reduce the mass of the MAV so that it could reach a greater altitude and higher speed.
