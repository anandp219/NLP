 It's a great show. I've seen him in concert, twice - once in Napa and once in Houston. The first concert was after his album Let Them Talk and the second after his album Didn't It Rain.Hugh Laurie is a talented singer and musician and he's supported by the excellent Copper Bottom Band. He cycles back and forth between the guitar, piano, and just standing at the mic.Hugh is extremely knowledgeable about early American blues, jazz, and bluegrass. The concert is mostly those types of music and he accompanies the songs with interesting stories about the originators. His love for the art is evident and enthusiastic. He's not a stage hog. Everyone in his band gets their solo.There are quite a few videos from his concerts, on Youtube. I'm not sure if any of them are authorized, so I'm not embedding one, here.
