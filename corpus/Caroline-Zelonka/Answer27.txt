 By hook or by crook, yes indeedy. I had such an awesome time at the past few Mountain View meetups that this one is on my can't miss list, especially since it looks like many new people (aka "friends I haven't met in person yet") will be there.However, I am not an East Coast gal. I know next to nothing about Manhattan and its environs, so I would appreciate any advice on places to stay that would be convenient and cheap, as well as airport recommendations. Due to temporary destitution, I will not be able to make my arrangements right away. Hopefully by the end of September there will be room on my credit card and a little positive cash flow coming my way. If not, though, there's this extra limb I can sell. And sell it I will, because I really want to hang out with the Quorans again.11/4 edit: Due to more-than-temporary destitution, my situation looks bleak as far as traveling to NY goes. As much as I'd like to attend, unfortunately have some serious cash flow issues that will be affecting my personal budget well into ... um ... OK, fine! Plain English version: I am broke and don't even know if I'll make it home for Christmas. Wait, I'm already home. I guess I will have to stay there. Have fun, peeps.
