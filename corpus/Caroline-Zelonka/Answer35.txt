 My go-to, everyday workout is my commute, which I perform on foot, walking for about an hour up a non-minor hill (374 feet total elevation gain). My pace is fairly brisk; trying to keep the heart rate up while avoiding heavy sweating, and so my choice of tunes ideally matches this pace.I like to listen to Pandora radio, which chooses tracks based on what you like. One of the things I like are drummy tunes, because they go well with marching. Adam and the Ants is great in this department, for example, "Kings of the Wild Frontier" Check out the drumline!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M2gtZPvzWgOr Depeche Mode's "Personal Jesus" (DM isn't always great for workouts, but this tune is.)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Hip hop also has a lot of tunes that have a beat, which you can walk to. (Yeah, I'm making a Dick Clark reference because I'm old.) Lil' Mama's "Shawty Get Loose" always gets me moving:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...There should be no discussion about workout tunes without mentioning Pitbull. "International Love" is just one of the tunes that will power you up that hill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=... If I'm really dragging, I'll bring out the Knife Party ("Centipede").This tune will also rock the car if you have the right subwoofers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...And then there is Daft Punk, which I like because the music is really colorful (I have a bit of musical synesthesia, and the extended guitar solo is, to me, these wonderful explosions of blue and teal). This one goes well toward the end of the commute, when the endorphins are really kicking in. ("One More Time/Aerodynamic")https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
