 This is not necessarily a problem underestimated by the healthcare industry, but care needs in the U.S. are expected to skyrocket and remain high for quite a while, as the Baby Boomer population ages.Currently, Baby Boomers are aging in to the Medicare system at a rate of about 11,000 people a day. Boomers constitute about 28% of the U.S. population, and by 2029, all living Baby Boomers will be eligible for Medicare. (Eligibility for most starts at age 65.)Medicare was originally implemented when the average life expectancy was about age 70, now it's 78. The current Boomer population is considered by many as the Unhealthiest Generation -- as a group, they have greater medical needs than their parents did at their same age. And with advances in cardiovascular and cancer treatment (two of the biggest killers of older people), Boomers are living longer lives despite their often-serious, chronic, and expensive medical conditions.National health care should be a priority for us, in part because Boomers will likely not be able to afford the care they will need. Many Americans do not realize the huge impact of the Boomer population on healthcare cost, access and availability, which will affect us all.
