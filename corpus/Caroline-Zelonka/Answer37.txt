 A2A. This started out as one of those charming, Pinterest-friendly ideas, but as a person who walks pretty much everywhere, I am starting to get tired of seeing these Little Free Libraries everywhere.Endemic to the kind of affluent urban enclaves neighborhoods which also loves to plaster around Neighborhood Watch signs and cutesy euphemistic placards telling folks to pick up their dog feces, these Little Free Libraries are like fucking weeds.Granted, they are very cute -- and a great place to dump your outdated software manuals, Scientology literature, crappy fad diet books and all other kinds of literary detritus. Every once in awhile you might find an especially-dog-eared bodice ripper to provide some erotic entertainment (if you don't mind it's well-used appearance) or a trashed copy of a favorite trashy novel, but most of these LFL books are just shit.And there are just too many of them. And, funny enough, many of them are full of broken glass. Perhaps LFL-smashing is this generation's Mailbox Baseball.* So they could be dangerous, especially if the glass comes into contact with the erotica and then cuts you as you are reaching for that copy of "Netscape Navigator for Dummies."http://www.urbandictionary.com/d...
