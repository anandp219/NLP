 Marijuana is worse for you, hands down. Even though its negative effects have been blown out of proportion in the media, it can also impair driving, make it dangerous to operate heavy machinery, lead to overeating and, if smoked, damage the lungs.In most parts of the world -- thank heaven, not mine -- it's also illegal. Which means it carry punitive risk, and illegally-grown marijuana is often exposed to harsh pesticides and other chemicals that could carry separate health risks.Rubbing your sexy parts is not associated with health problems of any kind. There was a rumor that male masturbation lowered prostate cancer risk, but no clear association was found. I suppose that it's also illegal if performed in certain settings, like a children's park, but the same is true for marijuana, even in places where it's legal.The truth is: neither one is very bad, and doing one can enhance the pleasure of the other.
