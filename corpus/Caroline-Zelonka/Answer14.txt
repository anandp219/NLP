 Before yoga pants, I used to wear loose shorts, regular leggings or capris to yoga class. Yoga happened. Eventually, some smart designers figured out these garments could be improved for yoga practice through artful tailoring and use of certain fabrics. These garments got to be popular in general for all sorts of exercise, as well as lounging, because there's always a place in fashion for comfortable, flattering attire.If they didn't exist, people would wear what they always have for exercising: loose-fitting or stretchable clothing suited to the activity they were pursuing.
