 I am not as lean as I used to be, but I am still very muscular, especially for someone who doesn't lift weights or do any follow any formal strength training routine.In a word: low carb. My core diet consist of lean meat, low-carb vegetables, lots of eggs, low-fat dairy (milk and cottage cheese), coffee and red wine when I want to drink. (Other than wine and coffee, I drink water almost exclusively.)I avoid most types of sugars, including both refined sugars and high-sugar fruits. I also try to avoid bread, pasta, potatoes, rice and grains -- even whole grains. I use oil and butter in small amounts, I snack on cheese, nuts and beef jerky when I want to treat myself.I still end up eating grains about 3 times a week, mostly due to circumstance -- when my BF makes me dinner. Note that I also made a New Year's resolution to stop dieting this year, so I don't really restrict myself -- though after 30+ years of dietary restriction, my healthy eating habits are somewhat ingrained (no pun intended).As long as I stick to my core diet, and exercise a lot, I can maintain my physique pretty well. If I was more concerned about it, I would eliminate the red wine and be more stringent about avoiding bread. (I do not have much of a sweet tooth, thank god, and I am lucky in that I naturally have a fairly muscular physique.)
