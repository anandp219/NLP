 A2A. I am old enough to remember the era of the comb-over, and believe me, there were a lot worse looks than Donald's Trump's. A large percentage of my male teachers -- in their 30s and 40s -- sported these awful hairstyles where the hair on the side of the head would be grown long, then placed over the top like a strip of bacon. Combovers could look semi-presentable in a controlled environment, and by controlled, I mean an indoor situation where the head doesn't need to move around much. The moment a man bent over, turned his neck, or heck, subject his hair to outdoor conditions, it would fall apart.My generation was the first to embrace the shaved head look, and man, what a difference. Finally, a style that actually looked youthful (combovers are horribly aging) that guys with thinning hair could embrace! Besides the way it looked, it also gave the man an air of confidence. He wouldn't have to worry about the pasted-over bacon strip falling over while walking outside, speaking in front of a crowd, playing soccer or whatever. I do think some guys look better with hair, sure. But the thing is, there are tons and tons and tons of guys who lose it and so far, there is no better aesthetic alternative than shaving or cropping the hair short. (Although I realize that hair transplantation can look natural, but I hear it's expensive and probably uncomfortable.)Back in the 1990s, when the shaved head came into its own, the first impression I got was one of boldness and confidence. Now that the style has gone mainstream, I don't get that impression as much. But again, baldness speaks to confidence, regardless of gender.Full disclosure: The man I'm dating had a full and bushy head of hair in his youth, but once it started to thin significantly. He tells me he decided to "take hair out of the equation" and now he either shaves it or crops it really short. (His hair is now mostly grey as well).
