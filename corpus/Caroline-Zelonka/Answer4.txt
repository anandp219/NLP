 If you want less shiny hair, you need to roughen up the cuticle by damaging it. You can bleach it, then dye it back to its original color, or maybe try washing it with dishwashing liquid or some industrial-strength soap.Alternately, there are hair creams that will give it a matte appearance, as will clays or powders. If you want to go that route, I would experiment with putting different things in your hair until you achieve the desired look. As far as making it grow in wavy, that's impossible. In women, I've seen hair change texture during puberty, pregnancy or menopause, but you don't want to experiment with your body's hormones just because you don't like the way your hair lays on your head. You can always curl it or get a perm if it matters that much to you.
