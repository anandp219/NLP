 So many cynical answers! I think it's more a case of temporarily suspending disbelief, like people do when watching a fantasy or science fiction movie. Haunted locales, houses especially, generally have some beautiful but eccentric features which kind of give you the willies -- just like the setting of the science fiction movie.If the movie goes on to explain things using junk science, you could immediately dismiss the rest of the plot. Or you could imagine what it would be like to be in that scenario. When the hero is scared, you're scared. When they finally triumph over the enemy, you feel a bit proud.The fact that there are enough people who sincerely believe, enough for it to gain a reputation as haunted gives it a little edge, some excitement. There are often mentally ill people involved (the Winchester widow was under a delusion that the ghosts of those killed by Winchester rifles were out for her), maybe a prominent citizen or celebrity. It stirs the imagination.And anyone who would visit an attraction for the sole purpose at laughing at the stupid people who seem to enjoy it, is an ass.
