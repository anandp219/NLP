 To add to Archie D'Cruz' excellent answer, the internet also has something to do with it. Advertisers used to put a lot of information into their ads because the consumer couldn't easily find it anywhere else.Today, it's easy enough to include a URL (or a QR code, though those things have not caught on, thank god) where anyone can easily delve deeper into the product features, benefits, specifications, pricing, shipping information, even consumer reviews and third-party endorsements.Traditional advertising used to be an important engine of consumer education, but at a price. It costs a lot more -- in terms of ad space -- for the advertiser to run long copy. And long copy does not capture attention like a stunning visual or punchy headline.Long-copy advertising is a dying art, and largely being replaced by what they call native advertising, which presents content of general interest or use to the reader, positioning the sponsoring advertiser as an expert or thought leader. So when you read something like, "Top 10 Travel Hacks for Students" (sponsored by American Express) on Buzzfeed, you're seeing the modern version of long-copy advertising.
