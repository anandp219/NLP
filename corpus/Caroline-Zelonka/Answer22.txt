 Maybe he has extra food and he doesn't want it to go to waste? I randomly share food with people all the time because I'm served more than I can eat.I would think this is the simplest, and most obvious answer.Certainly, he could have chosen another person to share his food with, but maybe you're the most convenient target, seeing as you are already a friendly acquaintance and not a complete stranger. But first and foremost, I'd say the most likely answer is that he didn't want all the food he had, and rather than throw it away, offered the extra up to someone whom he thought might want it.
