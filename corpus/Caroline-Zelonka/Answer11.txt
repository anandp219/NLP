 Up until fairly recently, ad agencies were typically named after their founders or principals. McCann-Erickson. Goodby Silverstein. Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.My guess is that the show did not require a McMann (whose title is listed as Chairman of the Board); he also may have been a partner in name only, or retired. Larry Tate was pretty old, as I recall, so it could have been a case of an older guy with clients and contacts partnering up with a younger man with energy and drive.My thought is that McMann was probably retired.
