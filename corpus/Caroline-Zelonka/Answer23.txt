 I felt like killing the Crown Prince. Upending an apple cart. Taking a nosedive from my broker's high-rise office into the streets of Manhattan, littered with worthless Quora credit certificates soaked in Top Writer tears. I went home and hugged my children. Ok, so they were just houseplants but they are the closest thing I have. I called in sick to work and binge-watched nine seasons of Friends while drinking cheap wine straight from the box. I checked and rechecked my Credits balance, hoping that the millions would magically reappear. I laughed. I cried. I called up random people and told bad bee pun jokes. And then I awoke. It was all just a dream. A really fucked up dream, where I lived in a world where I actually cared about Quora credits.In all seriousness, I knew it was coming. As a Top Writer who's also a bit of a Facebook fiend, I was informed of this well in advance. At the time -- early June, right after the big Mountain View shindig -- Quora announced it on the ultraprivate Top Writers Facebook page. (One of them; there are actually several pages in existence because after awhile, TW Facebook pages tend to implode into fights and general nastiness, after which time everyone migrates to a different Facebook page and the cycle starts anew.)Full disclosure: I only had 24,000 credits or so when it was announced, having given my entire wad to a brand-new user to thank her for a brilliant answer. (It was worth it, she was dancing on air.) But I think, at several points in my Quora history, that I hit the one million credit mark once or twice.But it was never about the credits. Millionairehood is a side effect of Quora addiction. If you spent as much time and energy on the site as I have over the same time frame (close to four years), I daresay you might have been seeing a lot of zeroes in your account, too.
