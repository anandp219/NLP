 Nuts and dried fruits, for someone on a diet??! (I assume it's a weight-loss diet rather than a weight-gain one). Utter foolishness! These are some of the most calorie-dense foods on earth.This infographic will show exactly what you get when you throw a few nuts into your mouth. Eight walnuts, for example, will net you 200 calories. Snack Smart: What 200 Calories of Nuts Looks Like [INFOGRAPHIC]. Dried fruit is almost as bad, calorie-wise, except it's also delivering a sugar dump into your system, which is the last thing you need while you are resting.I would recommend snacks that are heavy on water and fiber content (fresh vegetables or low-sugar fruits, like apples and strawberries), possibly adding a small amount of high-quality protein/fat. For example:2 cups raw cabbage with 1 tbsp. low-fat dressing (under 100 calories)One raw apple with 1 oz. low fat cheese (about 150 calories)Two cups popcorn with 1 tbsp. melted butter (about 15o calories)One hard-boiled egg (about 80 calories)8 oz. 1% milk (110 calories)I am also going to be a contrarian on this "don't get so hungry you can't sleep" thing. In my experience, if you're not hungry when you're asleep, your weight loss is likely to go a lot slower than if you get up to satisfy your hunger. It can be hard, but you can sleep with hunger pangs. The plus side is that you'll have a lot of food dreams, where you can gorge to your heart's delight and not ever get full. You will also have less trouble waking up, because you'll be eager to get breakfast. (Breakfast is very important, so don't skip that.) If you feel like incorporating nuts or dried fruits into your diet, breakfast is the best time to do so, because you'll be fueling your body for the activity ahead. But please, for the love of God, save the trail mix for the trail.
