 Stair climbing is an excellent exercise. Not only is it good for the heart, it has the benefit of being low impact (as compared to say, running or aerobic dancing0. If your knees are in danger of getting worn out, they will start complaining years -- if not decades -- before it happens. I am 48 and have been walking up hills and stairs as a primary form of exercise for a good 20 years now. Occasionally, I might have knee pain if I overdo it, but it takes a lot to overdo it (a very long, steep hike lasting eight hours or so is my knees' idea of overdoing it). Five flights of stairs is nothing. You'll also benefit from strengthening your legs and muscles supporting your knees, which can help ease pressure on the joints. Plus, you are incorporating exercise into your everyday life, which is one of the keys to maintaining physical health as you age. Keep trucking up those stairs.
