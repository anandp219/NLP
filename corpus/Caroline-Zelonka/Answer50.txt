 Have you considered the fact that you are transitioning from a child's body to a woman's body, and that women generally develop a fat layer, along with wider hips and breasts? I have no way to tell from your question if you are indeed gaining excessive weight, or if you are simply putting on the normal (and healthy) amount of fat that any pubescent girl could expect.I wish I had known this at age 11. It would have saved me a lot of grief, and unnecessary self-torture that came with extreme food restriction.This is what I would do if I was concerned about weight gain. Bring up the issue with your doctor. If you can't see a doctor right away, your school nurse might have some advice for you. At the very least, they may be able to reassure you that some fatness during puberty is normal.Look at your eating habits. If you can, add more fresh vegetables and fruit to your diet, avoid sweetened beverages (and this includes diet sodas) and sugary desserts. This is an area where your school nurse or doctor may be able to help you. Try to find some sort of exercise you can incorporate into your daily life. The kind that has you sweating and your heart pounding, though simple walking and housework/yard work will do. Exercise is a wonderful thing for both mental and physical health, and it will serve you in good stead as you get older (especially after menopause, when you really have to worry about slowing metabolism).If you indeed have a metabolic disorder, your doctor should be able to perform tests to identify the problem. (Sorry, but I am not an expert in this, but I have a hunch that metabolism may not be that much of an issue if you are a teen). But I would start with the lifestyle changes, and especially, the realization that you are growing out of your kid body into a woman's body.
