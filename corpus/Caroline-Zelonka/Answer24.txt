 There's a dehydrated human on display in Seattle's Ye Old Curiousity Shop. His name is Sylvester, and this is what he looks like.His real name has been lost to history. The body was found in 1865, by some cowboys in Arizona's Gila Bend Desert, and brought to the Shop in the 1950s. It was thought to be a case of natural dehydration, but in 2005, the body underwent CAT scans that revealed that Sylvester had also been pumped full of arsenic -- an early embalming fluid -- shortly after his death.How does he feel? You don't get to touch him, but I've seen him up close a million times. His skin is dark and leathery, and appears hard to the touch. Just what you might expect from dried-out skin on a pig or other hairless animal. But the fact that his teeth and soft tissue are more or less intact suggests that there is still some moisture left in his body; something the CAT scan also revealed.He still has a tongue and eyeballs, amazingly enough. In June, 2015, The History Channel Canada featured Sylvester on the premier episode of its show: Mummies Alive. I cannot view the clip from my location, but maybe you can.
