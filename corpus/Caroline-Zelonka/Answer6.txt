 College, for many students, is a highly social time. Students find themselves surrounded by new friends, and want to spend time enjoying one another's company. At the same time, many of them are discovering the pleasures of drinking. Alcohol is something enjoyed by people of all ages at parties, so it makes sense that college students will enjoy it, too.Sure, it's illegal. But it's not like the cops are running around throwing college students in jail for drinking. The likelihood of getting caught are very minor, especially if you are drinking at a private residence. And even when cops do show up, it's unlikely that any individual person will suffer significant penalties. (Of course, alcoh0l is also involved in more serious crimes, such as drinking and driving, but that's a separate issue.)There is not a lot of peer or societal pressure to abstain from drinking, just because it's illegal. In college, it's also easier to hide it from parents, who may have imposed certain additional sanctions that would discourage young people from drinking.I guess the simple answer would be: why would they want to wait? I would venture to guess that hardly anybody lives a 100% law-abiding life all the time.
