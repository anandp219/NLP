 Dentists will schedule their days around different kinds of appointments, which can include general exams, cleanings and restorative work such as fillings, which may be what you mean when you say "drilling."At the exam, they'll take a look at your teeth and the progression of any problems, hence the "teeth to watch" list. If a tooth does require attention, they will typically schedule that type of appointment separately. Even if it's something major -- like a cracked or abcessed tooth -- it can usually wait awhile. (In some cases, they will give you antibiotics and/or pain pills to tide you over.)Dentists will leave slots in their day to deal with emergencies, like broken teeth, but dental problems do not generally progress that fast. If they're scheduling you for 6 months out, you're doing pretty well -- my own dentist has me come in once every four months -- some patients are on an even shorter schedule.If you have a more complex issue, they may refer your case to a periodontist or oral surgeon. But typically, unless your teeth are severely neglected, or damaged because of trauma as I mentioned earlier, it's not like a regular, healthy patient is suddenly going to go from "tooth watch list" to "dire dental emergency" in 6 months.
