 In my case, marriage is probably the lowest priority when it comes to dating, though I am considering marrying my boyfriend on or around my 50th birthday, which will happen in 2017. (Holy shit!)Why? Mainly because I have given up on the idea of having or adopting kids. In fact, after I became infertile in my late 30s, I resisted dating (with an endgoal of marriage) because I cynically thought "What's the point?" (I've always wanted to have children, but I was less keen on having some that were not mine.)I would say now that companionship and intimacy are pretty much the only things I want. I am also interested in keeping my assets intact; that is another reason why an older educated woman might be hesitant to tie the knot. But I think maybe I want to try marriage, and it definitely would be fun to incorporate it into the big 5-0 celebration. Or not. I honestly don't really care either way, and if I die an unmarried woman, so be it.
