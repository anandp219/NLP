 I did, post 9-11. It was on a small local airline (Horizon Air, a subsidiary of Alaska Airlines) on a Seattle-to-Portland flight, which takes about a half hour.It was one of those small-plane flights that boarded from the tarmac, so passengers were directed down these fenced paths. Well, at this particular gate, two Horizon flights were boarding. And me with my terrible sense of direction took a wrong turn at one point.I get on the plane, find my seat and start to settle in. Captain gets on and does his usual speech, and I am barely listening, but my ears perk up when he said, "...and I'll be your pilot on this flight to Medford..."Medford?! Shit!! I flagged down a flight attendant and asked if I was on the wrong plane, and indeed I was. Good thing the Portland flight hadn't taken off yet. The crew called the other plane, and someone was sent to board the Medford-bound plane, check my boarding pass and I.D., then escort me to the Portland-bound plane. It felt a lot like getting on the wrong bus. I didn't have bags, just a briefcase (it was a day trip for work), so it wasn't a big hassle, and Alaska as a company is always very gracious about these things. I've probably experienced more than my share of airplane snafus, and getting on the wrong flight was indeed one of them.
