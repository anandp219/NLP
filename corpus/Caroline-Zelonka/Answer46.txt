 The first time I was taken out for ice cream, I was with my friend (and her father. I think I was six. We went to Baskin Robbins, and the dad asked me "What flavor do you want?"Previous to this, my experience with ice cream flavors had been limited to chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and ... that's it. This place had 31 flavors and I certainly didn't want to waste this unprecedented opportunity to try something completely different. But at the same time, I did not quite have the presence of mind to communicate this.Seeing my deer-in-the-headlights expression, my friend said, "Get Mocha Almond Fudge. It's the best."Damn if she wasn't right. Later on, Lucerne (the standard grocery-store brand my mom would usually get) came out with their own Mocha Almond Fudge flavor, which still is my favorite ice cream ever. (Sorry, but I can't really get into fancy desserts, I prefer my ice cream pumped full of air and stabilizers). I actually like Lucerne brand better than Baskin Robbins, Breyer's, Coldstone Creamery or even, as I said, the gourmet stuff like Molly Moon's.A distant second would be the 'Young Coconut' (not currently on the menu) at MItchell's Ice Cream San Francisco, which is located about a mile from my old apartment in Noe Valley. There is a traditional coconut as well, but the Young version, with its fresh, meaty coconut chunks, is pretty good. Third on the list would be pumpkin ice cream, Breyer's. (Not the Pumpkin Pie flavor, just plain pumpkin, slightly melted). But yeah, six-year-old Toni was right. Mocha Almond Fudge, by a mudslide.
