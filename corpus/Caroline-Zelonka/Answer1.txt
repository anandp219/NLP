 Facebook excels as a platform for announcing news. They don't call it a "news feed" for nothing. As such, it's ideal for announcing a death. I will vehemently disagree with anyone who says it's tacky or inappropriate. (It might be tacky to announce an acquaintance's death before an obituary is published, or the news is otherwise announced by the family, however.)It's up to you to post what you find appropriate. I would advise you to make it clear that the person actually died. We tend to use euphemisms to talk about illness, death etc., but sometimes they're hard to interpret.I'd also think about phrasing the announcement so that a "like" is appropriate. A lot of people will be tempted to press the "like" button to show support, but it's set up to backfire if the news is bad. (I am never one to judge someone for "liking" a bad-news post, but there are a lot of judgy people out there who may be quick to label the likers as insensitive or whatever.) But you can always say, "Celebrating the life of my brother, who passed away unexpectedly today ...." A picture with dates is good, as are stories or anecdotes. If you want to express your grief, that's totally fine, too. Expect a lot of nice comments; your FB friends will want to support you, even the ones you don't know very well. At the end of the day, remember that this is the kind of thing Facebook is for: to share your news and to foster connections. My best to you.
