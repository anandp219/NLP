 Camping etiquette dictates that you pack toilet paper out after its use, and dispose of it in the trash once you return to civilzation. I typically will bring a Ziploc plastic bag for these purposes, though I am also inclined to use a nice, wide leaf in lieu of toilet paper.If you can't pack it out, the best idea is to bury it in the ground; spreading it around a bit so it degrades more quickly.Yes, people care about trash in the wilderness. On popular trails and camping spots, it's not uncommon to find a popular peeing area (behind a large tree, on a decline) littered with with wads of toilet paper, which is gross and not very respectful of others -- or the environment for that matter.Often, signs will be placed asking (or telling) campers to "leave nothing but footprints, take nothing but photographs." Or just simple "no littering" signs. These are signs that people indeed care, and that leaving TP in the woods could leave you with a fine.
