 On the contrary, many intelligent people will keenly understand the impact their physical presentation can have on their lives. From an early age, you realize that people who look a certain way (cute, strong, intelligent, intimidating, meek, slovenly, confident -- pick your adjective) tend to get treated differently in certain situations.As one gets older, it becomes more apparent that, say, a boy whose body is large and strong will be less likely to be physically intimidated by bullies. A girl with nice skin, straight teeth and a slender body is more likely to be chosen for the Homecoming court. A teen with dyed black hair and nose piercings may not be taken seriously by the coach of the debate team. Anyone who thinks the surface is an illusion is wrong. It's true that we should strive to pay less attention to surface presentation, but we also cannot ignore its effects.I'm not the most brilliant person in the world, but yes, I would consider myself an intelligent person. And I fight the tyranny of body image every day. Even in my 40s, when some folks may think it's high time to give up the fight. But I realize that if I presented myself without concern to the way I appeared to others, I might not have such an easy time getting a job, or a date, or my grievances heard in court.It's not just my body, it's the way it appears when it is out in the world (because unless they live in a nudist colony, nobody is going to make a first impression as a naked being). And it's not like I worry -- as in have undue anxiety -- about it. But it's something I consider, with good reason, and I imagine many intelligent people do so as well.
