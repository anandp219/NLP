 The Lives of Others (2007) [1]  This is a powerful and quiet film, that follows the story of a member of East Germany's infamous Stasi; while he himself, in the course of his secret service duties, voyeurs into the lives of a playwright and his mistress. As he watches their lives unfold, every single little secret laid bare in front of him, he starts to internalize their happiness, and pain and suffering, providing a delightful juxtaposition with his own empty life. This movie is dark and intense, and relentlessly fascinating.Gattaca (1997)  A movie that does everything right, which is as much entertaining as is a great representation of what some call the "human spirit". A man disadvantaged in the worst possible way (genetically), in a way that is well beyond his control, manages to overcome that and achieve his dreams. Princess Bride (1987)  In my opinion, one of the best comedies ever made  endlessly entertaining, great cast of characters and (again, in my opinion) perhaps the most quotable movie  this is a thorough entertainer.Wall-E (2008)  I wanted an animated movie in my list, and I settled on this one  a delightfully heart-warming film about two robots, who find love on a dark and desolate, abandoned Earth. I am genuinely in awe of this movie, that it manages to portray a beautiful love story ... with (almost) no dialogues. Barry Lyndon (1975)  I think of this less as a movie, and more as a continuous masterpiece painting  almost every single frame of this movie is visually stunning.
