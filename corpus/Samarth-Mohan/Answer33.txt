 Because the community incentivizes these content creators  you'll often see poorly argued answers, throwaway answers, really-should-have-been-comments etc. being upvoted highly. On Quora, you're not supposed to upvote something you "like" or downvote something you don't. Upvotes and downvotes have a very very specific purpose on this site [1], and there are guidelines that ideally ought to be followed.It's up to us to make new users conform to the existing quality of answers on the site. And we can do that by voting responsibly. The community should realize that each of their votes contributes to the overall quality on the site, and that every time they upvote something unworthy, they're polluting someone's feed with it, and are contributing, even a little bit, towards Quora's demise.[1] Please see: What does an upvote represent on Quora?What are good and bad reasons to downvote answers on Quora?What does a good answer on Quora look like?
