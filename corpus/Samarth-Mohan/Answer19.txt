 My go-to comfort movie is Amlie.  I love the warm palette, the lighthearted whimsical storyline and an immediately lovable array of characters. The movie follows the life of the eponymous Amelie, as she goes through life on a quest to bring those around her, her own personal brand of quirky happiness.This movie, that has been described as a "delicious pastry of a movie", is a nimble and light-hearted comedy that is also visually stunning.Amelie is the warm blanket I wrap myself in when I want a break from the tediousness of reality.
