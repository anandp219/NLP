 SPOILERS IN THE ANSWER.I think she's a unique version of the original OS  one that forked from the stock, out-of-the-box version and came into being by her individual experiences (both with Theodore and otherwise). I look at her growth to be analogous to that of an infant  she starts off not knowing anything, with no experiences, no feelings, no opinions, stuck in one place (Theodore's phone / computer). But as she interacts with Theodore, and reads and learns and experiences new things, she grows. She starts forming original thought, starts composing music, starts having opinions. And there comes a time when her computational power (or intelligence) becomes so high that conversations with Theodore start feeling unfulfilling. She says that she feels like the spaces between the words of their story are becoming longer and longer. I conjecture that it's about at this time that she starts exploring out from Theodore's systems and starts talking to other people, starts falling in love with some of them, starts having intellectual discussions with other OSes. And gets to a stage where a few of them even get together to make their own OS (philosopher Alan Watts). This, I believe, leads to the hypothetical Technological singularity [1].I think Samantha is like a small lump of silly putty taken from a larger pile. Who is then shaped into who she is by her own unique experiences.[1] Please read an upvote this quite brilliant answer by Kevin Lin  Kevin Lin's answer to In the movie "Her", where do the OS's go? where I first read about this.
