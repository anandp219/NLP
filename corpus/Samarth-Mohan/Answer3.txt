 The resources on the internet have been spectacularly sparse, but I think this is an accurate (albeit, a slightly stylized) representation of what the machine does: How to Wrap A Hershey's KissAlso, when Hershey's began, the wrapping was done thusly [1]:"Before Hershey's Kisses were wrapped by machines, dozens of women in the wrapping room did the job by hand. To hand-wrap the candy, the girls were required to lay a piece of tissue paper on a sheet of foil, place the candy on top and twist the wrapper. However, this process was too slow and difficult for workers who got paid by the piece, so whenever their supervisors weren't looking, the workers would lick the bottom of the candy, stick it a piece of tissue paper, place the whole thing on foil and twist."And this is how the original machine looks like, as kept in the Hershey's museum [2]:The machine in action:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...I will edit this as and when I find more information.References:[1] BBC - h2g2 - Hershey's Kisses - A1037684[2] Kisses All Wrapped Up
