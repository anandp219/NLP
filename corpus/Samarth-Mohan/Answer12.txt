 The first thing I did post the announcement was lay my hands on "The Thick of It" and "In the Loop" and watch Capaldi in action. After a couple of episodes of the first, and a sleepy (sleep-deprived) viewing of the second, I can safely say that I am looking forward to Capaldi as the Doctor very much. He is a great, great actor and has a terrific screen presence.Capaldi will bring to this role, a kind of gravitas and fierceness that was not seen in Smith's or Tennant's Doctors. This will also involve a different (non-romantic) relationship between The Doctor and his companion. Which is great!
