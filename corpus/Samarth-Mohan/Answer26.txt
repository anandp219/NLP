 I'm a feminist because it's a no-brainer. I can't wrap my head around the concept that the two genders are anything but equal. I have lived and grown-up in a strongly patriarchal society  I've seen my mother, my sisters and my friends being treated differently, almost as second class citizens. And it incenses me. I've seen great human potential go to waste, only because this potential did not come blessed with a Y chromosome. To me feminism is a very simple concept  the two genders are equal and should, thus, be treated equally.I'm not out to do anyone a favour. I'm not doing this for "women everywhere". I'm doing this for myself and the people I love and care about. I'd hate for my (future) spouse or daughter to have to live through what I've seen.
