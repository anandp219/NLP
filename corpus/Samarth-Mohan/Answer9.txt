So, I know of at least one person who had 80p on Germany being 5-0 ahead at half-time at 300/1 odds.

According to http://fivethirtyeight.com this was statistically the MOST shocking result in World Cup history: The Most Shocking Result in World Cup HistoryEdited (10th July): Reportedly only 8 people in the world had Germany winning 7-1, with the most outrageous bet being "Germany to win 7-1 and Sami Khedira to score at any time", a punter put $20 at 2319 odds, winning $46,380.
