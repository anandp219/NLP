 I think the touted similarities are tedious and trivial; at best, superficial:Calvin and The Narrator both have "imaginary friends" who they often blame for their own actions, Hobbes and Tyler both have a very dim view of human beings, Both of them often get into fights with their friends etc.... and err, that's about it.I did come across a bunch of sites [1] [2] waxing lyrical about the "OMG" similarities between the two, but the "hard evidence" presented in these cases was flimsy at best, and straw-grabby at worst. If you look hard enough, and are flexible enough, you will begin to see "patterns" and "similarities" and "irrefutable proof" for anything.I think CnH and Fight Club are among the most influential pieces of popular culture of the last thirty years, but they're nothing alike, except, you know, superficially.[1] Calvin & Hobbes vs. Fight Club[2] Fight Club-Calvin & Hobbes Mashup -- A mashup trailer of Calvin & Hobbes strips with dialogues from Fight Club.
