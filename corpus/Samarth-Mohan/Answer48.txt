 Very honestly, I can't think of any positive outcomes that would outweigh the potential negative ones. When I joined the site, about a year and a half ago, users did have the ability to add comments to any question and answer anonymously. This feature was roundly abused, especially on question pages related to sensitive topics like religion, politics etc. It was just too easy for any random Joe to go anonymous on a page, leave a nasty comment, and move on.I think the current system finds the perfect balance between encouraging anonymous contributions while limiting the potential to abuse.
