 "Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, "This is an interesting world I find myself in  an interesting hole I find myself in  fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!" This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for."-- Douglas Adams' Speech at Digital Biota 2"Let us think the unthinkable, let us do the undoable, let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all."-- Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (1987)
