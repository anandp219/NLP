 Your A2A price depends only on the volume of paid A2A requests you receive and the prices at which these requests are made. Higher the number of requests and / or higher the price at which they're made, you A2A price will be driven up. On the other hand, if you don't get a lot of requests, slowly over time, your price will go down till you start getting requests again.Quora also allows you to set your own A2A price which is capped at a maximum value (as determined by Quora, and described in the previous paragraph). So, when you did not receive paid requests for a long time, your A2A price was reduced to 25, and like always there was an option of setting it to "Free".Also, see: How does Quora determine Ask to Answer prices?
