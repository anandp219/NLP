 I'm a big fan of Amelie. This film is entirely about the human imagination and it's effect on our perceptions of reality. The movie follows the eponymous Amelie as she uses her imagination in her quest to affect changes in the lives of characters around her.Amelie helps her landlady, mourning the death of her lover and stuck with the memory of his indiscretions, move on by writing a fake letter of apology. The landlady's outlook was confined by her knowledge of the affair, making it difficult for her to move on and in helping her, Amelie uses her own imagination to stretch the boundary of her's.In a similar vein, she sends her father's garden gnome on a trip around the world, when he is obsessed completely by the idea to finish the memorial to his dead wife, even at the expense of his own dreams. The father finds it difficult to understand and interpret the photographs with his limited imagination. However, Amelies eventually makes headway in changing her father's limited imaginations though her repeated attempts. And by the end of the film, he manages to leave the house on a journey to discover other ways to make his life fulfilling. Again, the film conveys how imagination can set boundaries on an individuals sense of the possible.Amelie also helps the jealous ex-boyfriend Joseph and hypochondriac Georgette get back together simply by helping them open their imaginations up by a misdirected reinterpretation of each other's actions, thereby attaching value to their otherwise mundane activities (sitting in the corner of the cafe everyday and hypochondria respectively). It's funny how their very real relationship between the two is born solely out of Amelie's imagination.In all these cases, we can see that Amelie uses her imagination and creative ideas to help affect very real changes in people's lives. Imagination is the tool that blurs the between possible and the impossible, pushing at the boundary.
