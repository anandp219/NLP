 Hi Anon,Please stop, relax and take a deep breath. First off, congratulations for knowing what you want to do, and being so motivated to achieve it. Most other people at your age have other (let's say, less intellectual) pursuits.Keep breathing.If you're talking about biological advantages that a boy might have, please don't worry too much  because there are so many other factors and variables at play (rich vs poor kids, kids from abusive families vs supportive families, kids from villages with little or no access to preparatory material etc) that being a woman does not pose a grave systemic disadvantage for you.Still breathing, yes?Now, to get to how you can do well in the exams  practice, practice and MORE practice. Nothing beats that. That coupled with a regular studying regimen and keeping a regular schedule, should get you through. YOU STOPPED BREATHING DEEPLY!As someone who prepared and got through JEE, let me tell you that the exam is about 50% confidence, and the ability to keep calm under pressure. About 20% of the kids who give the exam any year deserve to get through, but only 2% do  and it is that 2% that manage to keep calm under pressure. Use your nervous energy to good use  keep a tab on your studying schedule and what subjects you need to improve on etc., rather than focussing on how you can beat all the "boys".As always  Keep breathing.Hugs,Your (formerly) Anon Friend.
