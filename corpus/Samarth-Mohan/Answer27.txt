 The movie was Sadak, a romantic thriller featuring eunuchs, brothels, murders, suicides, disturbing visions, and other assorted violence. I was four. [*] This was in a small run-down theater in the town of Begusarai in Bihar, India in 1991. The movie poster. Yep, that's blood ... and a crucifiction. To make matters worse, I also managed to walk out of the theater on my own, got separated from my parents and made acquaintance with a rickshaw puller. On being asked who I was and where I wanted to go, I gave the only address I remembered  my grandparents' about 150 miles away. Meanwhile, my parents realized that the knee-high annoyingly high-pitched voice had been silent for too long and went into a oh-god-we-lost-our-child panic that only first-time parents are affected by. Thankfully the rickshaw puller was a nice guy and my parents caught up with me before I could embark on my adventure. Sigh.[*] People who know me are going, "Ahhhh, that explains so much" right about now.
