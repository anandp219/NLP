 It was extremely difficult to prune my list down to three. I managed to bring it down to five (okay okay, six) and then chose quasi-randomly.Gattaca (1997)This is easily my most favourite sci-fi movie. A man's struggle to beat his genetically coded inferiority in his quest to fulfill his dream of space travel makes for a compelling watch. I just love how Ethan Hawke works with single-minded determination, leaving no stone unturned to overcome his genetic "disability".Donnie Darko (2001)I recommend people to watch this movie with reading up as little about it as possible. The story of a brilliant and disturbed (in equal measures) high school student, Donnie Darko, who hallucinates a man in a bunny suit, who convinces him that the world is about to end and drives him to commit a series of crimes is best experienced with a fresh and open mind.Moon (2009)One week before the end of his three-year stint on the Moon, astronaut Sam Bell has a curious encounter that changes his life. With limited dialogues and a phenomenal soundtrack, this movie explores ideas surrounding identity and loneliness.Almost made the list  12 Monkeys, Dark City and Wall-E.
