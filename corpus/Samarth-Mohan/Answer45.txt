 I always read the book first.Most people who have watched the movie version of their favourite book will claim that they liked the book better. This is because, inside their heads, they have already created the perfect version of the movie for themselves. And no matter how good / stunning / visually appealing the final product is, it can never live up to the perfect rendering inside their heads; the readers have internalized and visualized every word of the book to create a version tailor-made just for them.Also, films as a medium are inherently more restricting than books; they end up being a subset of the books in terms of plot and character development, richness of imagery, scope of visualization etc. Films have cinematic and time restrictions; cinematic in that they have to make sure the 2 hr 30 min version of the story lives up to the expectations of the nitpicky reader as well as someone who hasn't been exposed to the books. This often creates a situation where no group of viewers goes home satisfied.When you read a book, you are only restricted by your own imagination while when you see a movie, you are experiencing it filtered through someone else's.
