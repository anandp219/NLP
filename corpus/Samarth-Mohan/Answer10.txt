 I see that Shinichir Watanabe's Cowboy Bebop has been mentioned already, but it'd be remiss to not mention his other lesser known animes  all of which have phenomenal soundtracks.Kids On The Slope [1]The show, based around the Japanese jazz scene in the 1960s, follows the lives of three young, high-school students, all "outsiders" who find themselves and each other through jazz. With a strong musical theme and background, the soundtrack needed to be spectacular, and KotS does not disappoint.You can catch a smattering of the soundtrack here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...[1] Sakamichi no Apollon (TV Series 2012 )
