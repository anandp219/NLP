 "Gorapan"orFairness of skinAs crazy as it sounds, fairness is considered beautiful, sweet, cleanin India! A typical matrimonial advertisement here would read  looking for fair, slim and tall professional for fair, slim and homely girl (age: 24). When a baby is born in India, the first question from the inquisitive aunt is Is she/he fair?. Not, Is the baby healthy and doing fine?. Sad but true.The fairness cream market in India alone is bumping up to $500 million, with healthy growth rates of 12-15% per year. This means every brand from the local to international ones such as Nivea, Loreal,P&G, J&J and others are players. Hindustan Unilever is the market leader with a 70% market share, promoting the popular Fair & Lovely cream. Note that if you are fair, by association, you are lovely. A clever product naming strategy that has obviously worked for them.While there is a definite inclination towards the female Indian, more recently, mens fairness has also opened up  with Bollywood stars like Shah Rukh Khan (for Fair and Handsome!), Shahid Kapoor and John Abraham endorsing mens skin whitening products. Whats good for the goose is good for the gander, I guess.Here is an infographic that I found on the website of Emami (makers of Fair & Handsome promoted by Shah Rukh Khan) that explained why men need fair skin (dont miss the Womens). This is so tacky and wacky, its hard to figure out whether to laugh or cry! Just in case you think this has to be a joke, heres the link to that page. The latest odd product extension for this already nauseating market is what I heard on TV the other day. It was a commercial for, get this, a fairness deodorant! In other words, dont just smell nice under your arms, get fair and lovely there too. I call this taking things a bit too far. Even for India.To read more about such stuffs have a look at Cogito Ergo Sum
