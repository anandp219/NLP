 Lal BihariThis guy became ghost when he had no official documents to prove that he is alive and hence was considered dead by the Indian state.Lal Bihari from Uttar Pradesh, India.In 1976, when a teen aged Bihari approached a bank to approve a loan, he was informed that he was actually dead. Death was a strange experience for Bihari. His friend, a "lekhpal", (low-level buereaucrat) insisted, "Take a look at this, you are dead". Lal Bihari was quite irritated with his friend as he recently had tea with him a few weeks before. It took Lal Bihari 18 years to get his life and his land back. During that time, he added the word Mritak, or Dead, to his name and to prove that he was living sought arrest, tried to run for parliament, kidnapped the son of the uncle who had stolen his property, threatened murder, insulted judges, threw leaflets listing his complaints at legislators in the state assembly and demanded a widow's pension for his wife. Each time he was either beaten up by police or rebuked for wasting officials' time. Unable to make headway, Lal Bihari The Dead sought the company of other ghosts in Uttar Pradesh and found an entire underworld of the deceased and dispossessed.It was only in 1994, 18 years after being declared dead, that the Azamgarh district magistrate, a Hausla Prasad Verma, declared Lal Bihari finally alive once again and also returned his land to him.Source:http://www.time.com/time/world/a...
