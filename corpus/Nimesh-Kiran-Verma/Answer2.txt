 Most things in the world can't be classified into Black or White..They fall in various shades of grey!And for the left over stuff over which a hard margin of Right and Wrong could be drawn, I think that the moral values which you(as an individual) have inculcated by yourself (since birth) or have been passed onto you by your relatives and the society as a whole is a basis to decide whether a thing is right or wrong.These moral values are the reasons we get a gut-feeling about a somethings or some situations.Interestingly each of the moral values which we have is based on one or the other thoughts or principle we have, and boils down to Existentialism.For example:-I believe that wise usage of water and not wasting it is Right.This is based on my belief that water is necessary for human existence.Which in turn is based on the belief that humans exists.And I can't prove that humans other than me exists!In fact I can't prove that I exists in the form as we all perceive !Read : cogito, ergo sum (philosophy).We all could be in Brain in a vat situation!P.S : I haven't actually answered your question but instead showed how it id related to the bigger question :  What is real and what is not? Cogito Ergo Sum
