 Short answerLong answerThere are very few characters in literature,who instill pride and inspiration in common folks. Abhimanyu is surely one such character.The Chakravyuha or Padmavyuha was a special formation and knowledge of how to penetrate it was limited to only a handful of Pandava warriors, namely Abhimanyu, Arjuna, Krishna and Pradyumna.However, to the Pandavas' disappointment, Pradyumna, son of Krishna, chose not to participate in the Kurukshetra war. Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna, knew how to penetrate the Padmavyuha but not how to exit it, leading to tragic consequencesThe thirteenth day of Mahabharat war is remembered for the construction of Chakravyuha by Dronacharya.By the inspiration of Duryodhan, Drona chalked out a plan to trap Yudhisthira the main lead of the Pandavas and hence win the war at one sweep.Dronacharya knew that Arjun and Sri Krishna had the skill of penetration and exit through Chakravyuh so both of them were purposefully drawn in to a separate battle with the Samsaptakas.Now the challenge of the Chakravyuh was sent over to the Pandavas' side.As planned Yudhisthir had no other option of himself accepting the challenge as the Krishna and Arjun were busy in a battle far away from head quarters, hence inaccessible.To his aid came young Abhimanyu.He knew, he has only the partial knowledge of Padmavyuh, but to a brave kshatriya like him, fulfilling his Dharma of protecting his King is must.He also had confidence (may be over confidence) and hope of winning the vyuh with the help of his mighty uncles.But Kauravas with the help of Jayadratha were successful in hindering four of the five pandavas from entering the chakravyuha (by making use of a boon granted to him by Lord Shiva) and thus brutally killing Abhimanyu in the end,by violating the norms of wars.Abhimanyu though sacrificed his life, was very effective in holding all the Kaurava maharathis (Great Charioteers, colloquially Great Warriors) at bay and thereby preventing the advancement of Kaurava forces towards the Pandavas.Hence avoiding, a certain defeat of his side.Also(as suggested by User)" Abhimanyu was actually the soul of a daitya named Kalyavana. Krishna after burning Kalyavana to death had captured his soul (tied him in a knot of his upper cloth) and taken him to Dwaraka only to stuff him into a cupboard. Ghatotkacha(who had been sent by Hidimba to take care of Subhadra in Dwarka as Pandavas were in the forest.) saw Krishna and got a scolding from him. He went and reported the matter to Subhadra who went downstairs to check. She opened the cupboard and a light entered her womb which caused her to fall unconscious. This was the main reason why Krishna divulged only half the secret of Chakravyuha to Abhimanyu when he was in the womb." Cogito Ergo Sum
