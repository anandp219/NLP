 Integers are represented in the following wayswhere b>0, all the a's can take value 0,1,2,...(b-1)and is the number we want to represent.We in normal day to day life use decimal representationwhich has b=10 and all a's can take value 0,1,2.....9.eg. Now about the number (say z) which you are asking about has12 as ones places and4 at tens placethis not possible as the value at ones place can't be greater than 10 (as your question says "TENS PLACE") and 12 being obviously greater than 10.Now if we assume that question is trying to ask a number of different base (which should be 13 or greater) assuming that base to be 'b'then the answer isz = (12 + 4*b) in decimal representationeg if b=15z = 72 in decimal representation.
