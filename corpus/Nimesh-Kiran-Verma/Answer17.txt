 I have been on the both sides of the game and the dynamics to be considered for an IDEAL answer are complicated.A plain, harsh and emotionally torturing 'NO' is the worst you could do to a person who has offered himself along with a precious and loving heart to you as a gift.There is nothing wrong with the Negative answer, after all you didn't ask for it, but the rejection should be coated with warm words, much like a Rose with beautiful red petals of appreciation to make up for the thorns of rejection.The person who has asked you out is, in his most vulnerable state, when anticipating for an answer and a plain harsh NO will surely kill a part of his soul and a part of his life (which may range from a day to eternity).If you are a heartless person (which I guess you aren't) go for the Kill and prepare another doomed soul who would now 'dare not to get smitten' in an emotionally doomed world of ours.On the other hand if your reply is over-coated with gratitude / kindness / affection then it will turn out to be a very feeble indication of 'Not available' and more of 'try again' hope booster for the proposer.You might have guessed it so far, I ain't actually answering your question but simply analyzing the results of the replies composed of various proportions for rejection and warm words.Above proportion depends a lot on the variables like:Your acquaintance with the person concerned (Can be close(in emotions), short(time duration), etc)How Matured the person is emotionally and intellectually.Do you want to have him/her as your friend.How will he/she react to your negative reply.etc.So my friend the proportion is up to you to decided but always try not to puncture a heart too wide that it cant be repaired.P.S : You are one lucky person to be loved by so many, do treasure them!
