 As quoted by Salman himself once"I can get caught in many things but there is one thing I will never get caught in, and that is acting - because I don't act. On screen I am like I am in real life."His Fans are fanatic about him being LARGER THAN LIFE person on screen and off screen..Other like you may be in search of something more than LARGER THAN LIFE- attitude from the lead actor on screen.By the way this have nothing to do with your question..Salman once gave a very profound and deep quote"In life go straight and turn right."Just felt like sharing.Source.
