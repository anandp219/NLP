 It is thanks to the Refractory period (sex).An increased infusion of the hormone oxytocin during ejaculation is believed to be chiefly responsible for the male refractory period.[5] Another chemical which is considered to be responsible for the male refractory period is prolactin,[1][6] which represses dopamine, which is responsible for sexual arousal.[6] It is additionally proposed that the gonadotropin inhibitory hormone (GnIH), which is considered to inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and sexual functions causes refractoriness of the post-ejaculatory refractory period.[8] This hypothesis also supports the increase of oxytocin and prolactin after orgasm in accordance with the previous studies.[8]In short, your body produces a lot of chemical signals to say, slow down.
