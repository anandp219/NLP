 Iggy Azalea is a very recent example.Iggy went the racist tweets route, along with bad press about her feuds, treating her fans poorly, and so forth. Before then, very few minded her relative lack of lyrical content or talent, making her the breakout star of 2014. However, she squandered whatever goodwill she had in the span of a year:Iggy Azalea's History of Controversy: A Timeline -- Vulture So today in 2015, we've now come to: In Memoriam: Iggy Azalea's Career - Huffington PostInside Iggy Azalea's Rapid Fall From Fame | CelebuzzHow Did Iggy Azalea Fall From Grace So Quickly?How the Internet killed Iggy Azalea - The Daily DotWhile sexism was speculated as part of the reason, I do think she would've rode out her stardom for a lot longer if she'd only refrained from these very public, inflammatory comments. A few others to come to mind would be Mel Gibson, Ariana Grande, Katherine Heigl, Megan Fox (not so much jerkiness, but calling Michael Bay Hitler). Yet others get off scot-free: Woody Allen, Alfred Hitchcock, Christian Bale (not a continuous jerk, but he had a famous outburst on the set of Terminator), J Lo, Julia Roberts (if anyone remembers her A Low, Vera shirt), Claire Danes, Demi Lovato (punching out her dancer), Naomi Campbell, Terry Richardson, Alec Baldwin, Sean Penn, Halle Berry, Russell Crowe, Russell Brand, the Real Housewives of Wherever, reality stars in general, and many, many more. It's always interesting to see who gets a pass and who gets crucified by the media.
