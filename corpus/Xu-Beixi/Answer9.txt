 It seems to me the teacher could've just removed the class if it were that bad. A lesson doesn't necessarily need to be conducted in one location, or even a classroom. Reading the story above, it sounds incredibly odd that all these people had to be called up. The student probably doesn't fear authority, and after four escalations it should be clear (you know that saying about trying the same thing over and over expecting different results). She likely fears being left out, or not being accepted by her social group. We move people by their psychological levers, not their physical ones.If one was to quiet a Disruptive student, the thing to do is the exact opposite. To give them as little notice as possible (especially if you suspect they are disruptive precisely for the attention), use positive rather than negative sanctions, and level with them if all that did not work. It would also be for the benefit for the rest of the class, which suffer the consequences of this squabble.As the Korean proverb goes, if you kick a stone in anger, you'll hurt your own foot.
