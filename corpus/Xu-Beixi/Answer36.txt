 Please don't do it.The problem with these 'pranks' is that they can always go horribly wrong. In the best case scenario, the owner laughs along with you, everything's forgiven. In the worst case scenario, you're savaged by their dogs, beaten with your own sign, and slapped with litigation (to add to trespassing on private property, there's emotional distress, harassment, etc.)- and the other problem is that nearly no passersby will take your side when they realize what you're doing.Ultimately, it's up to you. But I'd say nearly anything else is a better use of your time. Well, not shooting puppies in the face or injecting coffee into your veins, but you know what I mean.Thanks for the A2A, Nicholas!
