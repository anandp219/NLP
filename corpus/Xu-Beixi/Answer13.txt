 I think the key here is the fact that you clearly don't trust him.Without trust, there can be no loving, healthy relationship. It's immaterial if said mistrust is misplaced; it's simply a fact. The argument is only the symptom, the cause is primarily the lack of trust- and possibly a lack of respect, as evidenced by the caustic words exchanged.For many, the dating/wooing period before deeper commitment is the most polite behavior you'll ever see (be it men or women, especially the ceremonial Holding Back of The Farts). If his best behavior is to use those ugly -and fairly misogynistic terms- it seems another nail in the coffin to me.How would have you handled it?Personally, I try to avoid arguments whenever possible to go for a peaceful resolution (also see: Courage the Cowardly Dog). I would've told him when I first started noticing our emotional distancing and having my doubts or being suspicious of his activities. Then we'd have to talk it out. If the relationship is important and worth saving, the necessary work would have to be put in. If not, parting ways without enmity would be for the best. As Winkler warned, "assumptions are the termites of relationships"- by the time the structural damage reveals itself, the base is already gone. Best not to let them start at all.Thanks for another A2A, Candice.
