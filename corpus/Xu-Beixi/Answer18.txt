 There are a wonderful many markers that can be detected in your blood. You can find a simple breakdown here: What Do Blood Tests Show?A regular blood test () would look like this:WBC tells you of possible infections, RBC can indicate anemia, hemoglobin the amount of oxygen your blood can carry, platelets your ability to clot, and so forth. It's marvelously efficient, and the results are nearly instantaneous. For more complex tests, you can try for LDL and HDL (or basically, fats) which will tell you your risk of heart disease. You can test for a whole lot of antigens in blood as well- are you HIV-positive? Are you a hepatitis carrier? Tumour markers can tell you if you may have cancer. And so forth. I'm sure more are being discovered as we speak. However, worthy of note are false positives and false negatives. Mistakes can and do occur. Mark Twain mentioned dying of a misprint due to a typo in a health book; in our digital era, it may just be a bad test result.And the final part of the equation is the healthcare practitioner. You may have this set of results, but you probably require someone to interpret them as well; the limiting factor then becomes the doctor. In a world where everyone else comes to you, or transactions occur online- the medical profession is nonetheless one where you have to go to the doctor, rather than the other way around. Perhaps that will change someday, and House calls will make a comeback, possibly through more accessible concierge telemedicine.. Here's hoping!Thanks, James. :)
