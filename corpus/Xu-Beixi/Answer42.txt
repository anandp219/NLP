 American Beauty, whose movie won an Oscar too.It takes the symbol of a common suburban rose (although not its namesake*) and turns it into something very sexual and evocative. As it should- the theme of sexuality and repression in the suburbs is the driving force of the film.The placement of the rose is also a spoiler understood in hindsight- Angela and the roses, the centre of Lester's fervent fantasies, is still a virgin. The poster puts you in the perspective of Lester, choosing whether to deflower Angela quite literally.
