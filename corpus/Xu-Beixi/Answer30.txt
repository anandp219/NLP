 A lifetime ago (i.e. 3 years back), I attended the Singapore Airlines interview in hopes of landing a job as an air stewardess. The main reason being, my father had wanted me to see the world- just not on his dime. It was held in the lobby of the Sheraton, and took up nearly the entire second floor of it. Hundreds of young men and women lining up, snaking queues, and endless anxious faces. It was almost like a really hip club- you had to wait in line to do everything, everyone was dressed their best, and nobody looked like they were enjoying themselves to any degree. Still, I made it through the first few interview rounds.Then came the document checks. The moment the old lady (who looked like she hadn't smiled in years) manning the booth found out I'd been born in China, the large, bold words "CHINA BORN" was written on the top of my application. And unsurprisingly, failed me the very next round. Failing me wasn't the bizarre part. Failing me at the skin check round was the truly farcical bit, given the lack of tattoos, scars, or blemishes. Then again, it may have been that at the age of 23, I was simply too old for them. According to Bigfoot, I would've quit "in 4 days" either way, unable to keep up with the constant smiling and endless requests. :D Since then, I have never been weighed and measured at any other job interview.
