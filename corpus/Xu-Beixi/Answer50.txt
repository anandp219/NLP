 You're right, they're not a substitute [1].The most obvious difference is that you're missing out on a whole lot of nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals that vegetables provide. The next is if you're suffering from diarrhoea and haemorrhoids; then it depends on the type of fibre you take- supplements tend to be useful here as they can contain a lot of soluble fibre. A lot of high-fibre vegetables contain insoluble fibre, and that bulks up the stools [2]. It can also cause bloating, cramping, and gas [3], which vegetables tend not to (unless, you know, we're talking the musical food, beans).Finally, your fibre supplements tend to be more expensive [4] than your average vegetables.The truth, of course, is more complicated, nutritionists say. While fiber supplements such as Metamucil, Benefiber, Fiber Choice and Citrucel can give a healthy boost to diets a little low in this indigestible, plant-based nutrient  especially helpful for people with sluggish digestion  they're no substitute for the real thing.[1] Are Fiber Supplements as Good as the Real Thing? | Fiber ...[2] Fiber Powder Vs.
