 No.The rule is clear: those able-bodied should offer a seat to those who are less so. In all the major Asian cities I've been to (and this happens in many other places, I imagine), train seats closest to the doors are marked out as 'priority seats', with clear indication that this was meant for pregnant women, the elderly, those with small children, the handicapped, and those otherwise in ill health.This works both ways, I've had a seat given up to me by a gentleman when I felt faint one morning on the way to work, and have conversely given them up. A few days ago, I gave my seat to an elderly woman. As she got off several stops later, she thanked me with a warm, crinkly smile. But to my surprise, she turned around and chastised the 30-something man sitting right next to me for not giving up his instead. I do think there is a somewhat sexist expectation there; we were both able-bodied young people, but there is a heavier expectation placed upon him.That said, I've personally never seen "perfectly able women rudely unseat male passengers". There have been incidents of quarrels over train seats, but the only local one that I know of has fondly been titled "Auntie vs Ah Lian*", and gone viral many times over thanks to the lack of exciting incidents that happen to Singaporeans on a yearly basis:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...* Ah Lian () is a Singlish term for an unsophisticated young woman of Chinese descent with loud tastes in fashion.
