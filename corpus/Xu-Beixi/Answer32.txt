 Surprise, surprise. Princess Leia's bikini has its own Wikipedia page! :DThe slave Leia costume has been elevated to pop culture icon status, spawning various spoofs and parodies and even a dedicated fansite.[11] Outfit has become one of the popular for Halloween.[12][13][14][15] One Wired magazine editor stated the only reason for the outfit's fame is "no doubt that the sight of Carrie Fisher in the gold sci-fi swimsuit was burned into the sweaty subconscious of a generation of fanboys hitting puberty in the spring of 1983."[1]So yes, it is adolescent male fantasy that sprung this metal bikini into our pop culture. Princess Leia herself is that fantasy- smart, strong, a Jedi master, and Chief of State, adding a sensual, revealing costume to the mix is basically adding gunpowder. Taking into account all the imitators, conventions, and even costume contests* specifically dedicated to her, it's easy to see why we remember it decades on.*Princess Leia Bikini Contest - YouTubePrincess Leia Look-A-Like ContestNot to mention the occasional parody:www.dumpaday.comWhee!
