 Bhuvi's excellent answer made me think of a recent incident.Bigfoot and I were with a housing agent a few months back. It was the first time I'd met this man; we were basically strangers.At some point, I noticed his fly was undone.So I told him quietly, and averted my eyes as he went off to a corner to zip up. Out of earshot, Bigfoot asked me not to do it again. The rationale being "he would've noticed eventually. Your intentions may have been right but you didn't have to tell him." I think both sentiments are valid, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. In a separate incident, I told a complete stranger her work dress was unzipped in the back; she smiled an embarrassed little smile and genuinely thanked me for it."Hi, I'm really sorry, but... " in a soft tone tends to work very well- you're putting yourself in a position of relative weakness and therefore non-threatening to the receiver. I don't think the only factor at play is the gender(s) of the people involved, or even the degree of familiarity. I would say it's also your tone and body language, the mode of delivery, and context. Whenever I've approached strangers in public for no apparent reason (to them)- they would look quite lost for a second, and their features would transform into one of gratitude when they understood what was going on.However, you're asking two different things here- correcting an objective wardrobe malfunction (fly down, dress unzipped, tp stuck on shoes) is one thing, correcting a subjective one (unbuttoned top button, off-the-shoulder top) is quite different. In the latter, it is typically assumed the wearer intended it as such, and should be left alone. There is a cliche that we ought to err on the side of caution, and I believe it is applicable here.
