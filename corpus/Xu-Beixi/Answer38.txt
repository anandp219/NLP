 Research shows there's a good chance these are ambitious, high-achieving men themselves.Anyway, someone has already written an entire book about the subject of high-performing partners matching up: Why Smart Men Marry Smart Women - Amazon.comAnd more- we do tend to choose people similar to us:The academics report, published in the European Journal of Operational Research, did say that men and women choose partners on the basis of love, physical attraction, similarity of taste, beliefs and attitudes, and shared values. In the US, it's also been found that more women are increasingly marrying men of similar education levels (please ignore clickbait title):But now, for the first time since Pew Research has tracked this trend over the past 50 years, the share of couples in which the wife is the one marrying down educationally is higher than those in which the husband has more education.Record share of wives are more educated than their husbandsAnd this:On both sides of the pond, research is revealing a substantial rise in what sociologists term positive assortative mating. Translation: getting hitched to someone of similar education, status, and those all-important box-set requirements. Why high-achievers are no longer marrying beneath themThanks for the A2A.PS. Bigfoot and I had a text conversation today that went:Bigfoot: "Intelligence without ambition is like a bird without wings."Me: "Well, many birds have wings but can't fly anyway. Emus, ostriches, penguins, kiwis, rheas, cassowaries."Bigfoot: "Yes, they're the ones that usually get chased down and clubbed..."Me: "Touche."
