 I'm afraid I don't know until we have a look at you in person. It could be anything ranging from entirely normal to serious, without answering a few questions.Can you describe these projections? How do they feel? What colour are they? How many?How high?Is there pain/aching/soreness in the spot?Are they bleeding?How long have you had them?Are there any other symptoms?Say, abnormalities in bodily functions- your appetite, your urine, your bowel movement, your sleeping patterns, temperature, and so forth. Or any strange smell or taste, etc.We cannot diagnose you over the internet either way, but please take stock of these questions when you visit your physician, or dentist.Thank you for the A2A, Anon.
