 Absolutely!Even after we establish relationships, we still go out on dates. Here we are, on a Sunday morning date.(Not pictured, as usual, Bigfoot.)There are an infinite number of wonderful and healthy ways to conduct a romantic relationship, none of which are inherently more correct (or indeed, less wrong). I see some mild confusion over the definition of date- allow me to offer Judith Martin's old school version:There are three possible parts to a date, of which at least two must be offered: entertainment, food, and affection. It is customary to begin a series of dates with a great deal of entertainment, a moderate amount of food, and the merest suggestion of affection. As the amount of affection increases, the entertainment can be reduced proportionately. When the affection IS the entertainment, we no longer call it dating. Under no circumstances can the food be omitted.  Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct BehaviorIf you've offered or accepted an invitation to an event wherein there was food, entertainment and affection present, you've probably been on a date. I would add the potential for romantic interaction to that definition, since it technically covers childhood trips to the zoo and the occasional golf tournament as well.
