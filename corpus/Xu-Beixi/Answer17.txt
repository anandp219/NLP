 I don't know. There aren't a great many studies done on the happiness of psychopaths, but there is some speculation. Firstly:Empathy is key to our normal moral development. Each time you hurt someone, that persons distress becomes your pain, and you start to associate your vicarious pain with harming others. Violence then starts to feel intrinsically bad. Helping others, on the other hand, makes you feel their happiness, and will start to feel good.If you were to lack empathy, this would never happen. Inside the Mind of a Psychopath It is likely that psychopaths may not feel happiness as we know it, in all its nuanced forms- the full spectrum from contentment to ecstasy. But rather, they receive elation or feelings of glee from getting their way or getting one over someone else.That said, I believe there are degrees of psychopathy and some psychopaths who are more capable of smaller forms of empathy than others. There has also been suggestion that empathy is like a muscle that can be worked out and improved with time and repeated usage. This points to a possible method of mitigating the influence of psychopathy, and it is plausible that one without empathy can learn to develop said function. (Thus leading to a greater range of possible emotions.)Finally, if you're interested, fMRI studies have been done on psychopathic individuals- indeed, their feelings are much fewer, much more shallow, and less frequent. The things that induce emotional reactions from 'normals' don't do it for psychopaths:An fMRI study of affective perspective taking in individuals with psychopathy: imagining another in pain does not evoke empathyThanks for your question!
