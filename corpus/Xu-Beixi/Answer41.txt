 I realize a point is being made here about weight, but I hope to point out that both pictures being posted are of women who are:of Caucasian descentblonde (as a side note, both Marilyn* and Candice* were originally brunettes- surveys have found that UK men tend to prefer blonde women, women brunette [1])in their 20sposing in a manner that's sexually provocativestyled, lighted, posed, and in the latter case, photoshopped*It's a very heterosexual, male, caucasian, and western-centric ideal. This takes the relevance out of the question, unfortunately. There is an underlying assumption of what all cultures and all nations find uniformly ideal that is mistaken to begin with.But to answer the main question: There certainly exists a biological and sociological basis for a culture's preferred ideal form of beauty of the time- biological points to a woman's fertility, her WHR (both Marilyn and Candice have an ideal WHR of close to 0.7), the smoothness and clarity of her skin, her facial and body symmetry, her age, her hair, her nails, and so forth. Sociological would be height, skin colour, neck length, foot size, body hair, and plenty of extraneous decorations involving piercings, plates, tattoos, keloid scars, velvet moles, cork cheeks, blackened teeth, sharpened teeth, and mouse-skin eyebrows. And so forth.And then there are some which are in between- weight, I think, is one of them. There have also been studies to show that the preference for weight fluctuates according to men's states, or even that of the economy:Why Stressed-Out Men Prefer Heavier Women | TIME.comPlayboy Playmate Curves and the State of the EconomyDemand Curves: Playmate Economics - The New York TimesSo if you go by those studies, as men grow wealthier, they prefer thinner women. On the other hand, the Tang dynasty of China famously favoured buxom, heavier ladies. It was also "the most glistening historic period in China's history", so who knows for certain?[1] How men and women have totally opposing views of perfect faceBody ideals from around the world revealed in new photoshop experiment(Yes, I realize they're from the Dailyfail, but it's interesting nonetheless.)
