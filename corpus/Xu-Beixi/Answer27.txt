 No. The man I'm with is 5'7 on a good day, and he never comes up short. And you're not objectively short:the median or typical adult height in these developed populations (as the widely abundant statistics from these countries clearly state) is about 170.5 centimetres (5 ft 7.1 in) for men and 160 centimetres (5 ft 3 in) for women.Short statureHowever, it is true that short men are shortchanged in many aspects of life, not just the dating arena:[1] Short People: It's a Tough Life[2] Short Men: Why Women Aren't Attracted Enough to Date ThemI would put forth that there are many other characteristics far more important in a mate than the superficial, and we recognize their importance as we mature. I read a thoughtful comment on dlisted that was lovely food for thought:As I've gotten older I've found that I'm no longer fixed on a "type." It's more or less an affinity for a set of traits, or a combination of habits, values, and behaviors. There's no formula, no equation, no requirement, even. The range of who and what I enjoy watching and interacting with has broadened, while at the same time I find myself looking at the "hot" guys and going... "ew." Don't get me wrong, looks can, and do, factor in. But even with looks I've found a lot more latitude.As a gay guy, it's weird to recognize there's a developing lack of attraction for that which is marketed as "attractive." Maybe I'm growing up, growing older, or getting tired of trying too hard. Whatever. I'm grateful it's happening.Traxley Launderette, Comments OFF TodayThanks for the A2A, Abir!
