 Since you've already apologized, I'll address the latter part;But I feel it's too late for us... I guess I'll keep my feelings to myself and see it as it is, we've had an opportunity and missed it. :(I respectfully disagree. Chris Rock, despite his penchant for yelling, speaks the truth when he says we're never going to meet the perfect person at the right time:Even if you meet the perfect person,it aint gonna be at the perfect time.Youre married, theyre single. Thats right.Youre Jewish, theyre Palestinian.Youre a Mexican, theyre a raccoon.- Chris Rock, Never ScaredFurthermore, it sounds like he may have feelings for you too- how many men do you know of who have heart-to-heart conversations for hours and hours with women they previously dated whom they have no feelings for?In short; there's never a perfect time. The time to do right by yourself and others is always now. If I were you, I'd make it clear. At its worst, the relationship takes on a new dimension that's slightly awkward. At best, you eventually work your way towards each other and start a new life. After all, you both appear to be mobile to some degree, and there is no telling if those moves reverse in the future. It seems to me there is little to lose, but the world to gain should you tell him how you truly feel.Thanks for the A2A, and I wish you all the very best. :)
