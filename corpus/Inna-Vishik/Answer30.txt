 Like all piercings, it hurts in the moment you are getting stabbed, but not too much afterwards, unless it gets jostled during the months long healing process. A conch piercing is subject to jostling if you have long hair, if you sleep on your side, if someone grabs your ear, or if you wear certain types of headphones. Some of these activities are hard to avoid, so expect a bit of pain, though not excruciating, in the first few months. Ear cartilage piercings nominally take 9 months or so to heal, but in my experience, the conch took a year or two to fully settle such that it was not easily perturbed by headphones, hair tangles, and side-sleeping.
