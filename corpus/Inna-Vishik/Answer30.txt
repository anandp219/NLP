 As a woman who will not tolerate a partner who does not have a Green's function for every situation, I fully understand your specific intellectual needs. Unfortunately, most professors move in social circles where it is common to have a spouse/serious girlfriend by age 30, so your pickings will be slimmer than you might assume from the stereotypically non-panty-dropping nature of the profession. Still, with the following advice, you might increase your chances for success.Narrow your search. There is a wide array of institutions of higher learning in the Boston area. Honestly assess what you are bringing to the table. Is it most compatible with a professor in a world-renowned research university or a commuter school? Narrow your search even more. One must be driven and focused in their chosen specialty to become a professor, so if you date one, you will hear about their work. Pick a department which does not bore you to tears.Carefully select your victim. Academic departments have one or more weekly colloquia where professors, students, and postdocs congregate to listen to research presentations. The professors sit in the front and they tend to ask more questions than junior people. Stalk these eager beavers and make a mental note of the ones who do not have wedding bands. Go to the department website and research the names and offices of your potential mates.Find out if your chosen prince is single (not all men without a wedding band are). A single professor will be in his office late in the evening and on weekends, and a married professor typically won't. You must gain access into their building and present yourself during these key hours.After these four steps, you can just do whatever the girly magazines suggest for catching a man's attention. I have no idea what this is, but presumably it involves dropping a writing implement on the floor or flipping your hair. Good luck!
