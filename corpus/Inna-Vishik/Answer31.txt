 In my field, I wouldn't characterize most papers as being badly written, though minor mistakes like typos are more common than in a typical newsstand magazine. Part of the explanation for decent writing is that there is a uniform structure for journal articles, so people do not attempt unique exposition techniques which they do not have the rhetorical agility to handle. Additionally, it is common for papers to be read carefully by several sets of eyes: the co-authors, a friend/colleague not on the paper, the referees, and sometimes the editor.For the papers where the two factors above do not produce a readable manuscript these are some reasons why:The paper was rushed, because of pressure from competing research groups or to meet a deadline. As a journal referee, I read A LOT of papers in this stage of the revision process, and no referee who actually reads/cares lets a paper get published in an incomprehensible form. I suspect this factor is what plagues the CS papers in the answer details.Whoever wrote the paper is not a native speaker of English (assuming an English language journal obvi). This is where another set of eyes would be useful, but research groups based in other countries might not have access to native speakers, other than professional translation services. I'm not sure how well professional translation services are equipped to implement some of the subtle exposition tricks used in scientific writing (e.g. "These data are not inconsistent with the following possible explanation...")Some papers are just so esoteric (even by the standards of basic research) that they probably won't be read/cited by many people. Why spend time perfecting these sorts of papers?
