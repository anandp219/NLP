 Helium is a relatively scarce and non-renewable resource on earth. In addition, it has many uses in industry and in research, some of which cannot substitute something else for helium, so there is a large (inelastic) demand for this scarce resource. These three factors conspire to make it expensive (~$15/Liter (125 grams) for liquid helium in the US).Scarce:Terrestrial helium is almost solely a biproduct of uranium and thorium fission. These elements are not very abundant on earth (see: Abundance of the chemical elements) Helium is extracted from the earth through natural gas mining, where it typically constitutes only a small percentage (<5%) of the gas in the mine. There are costs associated with distilling this small constituent from the rest of the gas, and the effort is only worthwhile if prices are high enough.Non-renewable:The earth is not producing new uranium and thorium, so that which exists on earth is pretty much the only source of heliumOnce helium is released into the atmosphere, it becomes uneconomical to recover it because it is so diffuse--only 0.000524% (see: Atmosphere of Earth)Demand:As the smallest non-reactive atom, helium is the only element that can be used to detect small cracks in vessels that need to be able to withstand extreme pressures (both low and high)As the cryogen with the lowest boiling temperature, helium is extensively used in research applications, such as the Large Hadron Collider as well as low temperature physics labs at your local university. While there are theoretically other ways to cool something to very low temperatures, these alternate methods are not an appropriate substitute for every situation because of space, vibration, durability, magnetic field, and other concerns.Hospital MRI machines and the semiconductor industry also make extensive use of helium.The only factor that diminishes the cost of helium is that it is non-reactive so it can be recycled indefinitely.
