 Buy a laser of your desired wavelengthBuy a quarter waveplate manufactured for your specific wavelengthMake sure your laser outputs linearly polarized light of known polarization using a half waveplate (to rotate polarization angle of linearly polarized light) and/or a polarizer (to cut out polarizations other than the one you want)After the optics in step 3, orient the quarter wave plate to make circularly polarized light (polarization of incident beam 45 degrees from easy axis)If you are talking about a laser pointer instead of a tabletop laser, there might be an off-the-shelf solution like the one described above that you can screw on to the output. If not, you can manufacture a fairly compact attachment by the procedure above.
