 Among some sectors of the experimental physics community, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is perceived as being more capital intensive than other small-lab-based experimental techniques. This characterization isn't necessarily accurate, because most small-lab-based physics experiments are 'expensive'* these days since most experiments are quite specialized and don't enjoy any economies of scale.The main factor potentially driving up the cost of STM is vibration isolation. If you want to study atoms on sub-atomic length scales and maintain position registry 1000 atoms away, you need to make sure that the STM tip does not vibrate relative to the sample too much. It should be noted that vibration isolation is not always a money sink. For some types of experiments, it is sufficient to just build the STM on a floating table in a lab space which is situated on the buildings' foundation (basement if there is one, first floor if there isn't). For more extreme vibration isolation, one needs to float the entire lab floor on which the STM sits (plus one or two more vibration isolation systems on top of that), which quickly escalates costs. In addition, an STM experiment which requires that much vibration isolation is likely to be operated at very low temperatures, so throw a dilution refrigerator on top of that.*the word 'expensive' needs to be qualified here: I mean several hundred thousand up to several million dollars. This is expensive by most civilian price scales, but is much cheaper than large facilities like the LHC, and much cheaper than most types of federal expenditure. Thus, it actually represents a good bang-for-the-buck as far as science funding is concerned.
