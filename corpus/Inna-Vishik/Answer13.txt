 The main "disadvantage" of graphene is that it is not the mythical wonder material that some people believe it is. Reading the questions on Quora, one might conclude that graphene (which is a one-atom-thick sheet of carbon) can be fashioned into bullet-proof vests, skyscrapers, and every last component in your smart phone. This, and especially the applications harnessing a severe misunderstanding of graphene's mechanical properties, is far from true. Graphene is a wonderful material for studying basic physics (though certainly not the only interesting material out there) and it might one day be used in select technologies (e.g. transparent conductors for touch screens), but it will not revolutionize every sector it touches by any stretch.
