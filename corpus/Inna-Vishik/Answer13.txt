 The time lag is ~5-20 femtoseconds, depending on the energy of the photons and materials parameters of the metal. One femtosecond is [math]10^{-15}[/math] seconds or one quadrillionth of a second. This is super fast, but there are emerging experiments which can perform measurements on this time scale and faster (see: Attophysics). Below are details about where this time lag comes from.The photoemission process can be divided into three steps, each of which can be assigned a timescale.Electron receives energy kick from photonExcited electron travels to the surface of the materialElectron exits the material, losing energy equal to the material's work functionHow long does each of these steps take?Step 1: Like the well known momentum-position Heisenberg uncertainty relation, there is a similar one for energy and time. Thus, when one knows the energy of a process, they can assign a timescale to it which is inversely proportional, based on this uncertainty. The relevant energy in the first step is the energy of the photon, which can vary by many orders of magnitude. For the sake of argument, lets pick something on the low end, say 10 electron volts (eV). This corresponds to a timescale ([math]t=h/E[/math], using planck's constant, h, in appropriate units) of 0.4 femtoseconds (fs). Step 3: I am going out of order here because this step is similar to 1. Here, the relevant energy is the work function of the metal, which varies a bit among materials, but 4.5 eV is a good guess. This corresponds to a time uncertainty of 0.9 fs.Step 2: This step is given by [math]\frac{\text{how far the electron travels}}{\text{how fast it is going}}[/math]. Lets only consider primary electrons, which make it outside the sample without scattering with other electrons first. Thus, 'how far the electron travels' is given by the electron's mean free path in the material. This is not a strong function of which material you consider, but it is a strong function of the electron's kinetic energy after it received a kick from the photon (see image below). Using the 10eV kinetic energy, we get a distance around 1 nm. For a measure of how fast the electron is going, we can use the fermi velocity, which varies a lot among different materials. A typical value (give or take a factor of 10) is [math]10^5[/math] m/s. Thus, we get [math]10^{-14}[/math]s, or 10 fs, as the time it takes the electron to travel to the surface.Thus, we get 11.3 fs altogether for the time lag between arrival of photon and emission of photoelectron, for the particular experiment and materials parameters considered here.Inelastic mean free path of electrons in a solid (many different materials are compiled in this graph) in nanometers, as a function of the electrons' kinetic energy.
