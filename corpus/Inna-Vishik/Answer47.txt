 This may be field or journal dependent, but every review paper I have written has undergone peer review (occasionally the brutal months long variety). The majority of these papers have appeared in journals which usually contain primary research, but occasionally have a special issue or a group of invited articles reviewing a specific topic. Note that there are journals which specifically only publish review papers; many of them have 'reviews' in their title.Edit: I can't vouch for medical research journals specifically, but that's what you get for A2Aing without checking the profile.
