 A LinkedIn profile for someone in an academic career is different in that it is almost never the primary way in which they showcase their skills, accomplishments, and qualification.For academics who are not looking to transition into a different career, a LinkedIn profile does not serve the same utilities as it does for people in other professions.A means for someone to contact them in a professional capacity: contact information for academics is usually available on their institution's websiteVisibility to recruiters: the 'recruiters' for academic positions are professional academics themselves, and they either contact people by the means above or because they personally know them alreadyJob postings: very few academic jobs are posted on LinkedIn. Because LinkedIn is not particularly useful for academic careers, the LinkedIn profiles of academics tend to be less thoughtfully curated, and they are often just a copy/paste of their CV (which can stretch on for well over 10 pages for senior people). In academic CVs, words like 'investigated', 'studied', and 'searched' count as action verbs, and the really brave among us will manually enter all their publications into an interface which was not meant to handle tens or hundreds of papers with multiple authors. What LinkedIn is useful for is cultivating or maintaining ties with people in industry. This can be useful if one wants to leave academia, if one's student wants to leave academia, or if one wants to start a company based on their research. However, these purposes are explicitly not for an academic career. See also: How important is LinkedIn for PhD students?
