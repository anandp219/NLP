 Yes, it is possible to get admitted to a PhD program without a physics major, though it is perhaps more difficult. The biggest stumbling block is convincing the committee that you have the same knowledge base, because graduate core classes are not of introductory nature: they assume a prerequisite undergraduate course. The question details indicate that you are a ChemE major. If your ChemE curriculum was like my undergrad friends', it included courses in quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and electromagnetism. Thus, you are in a better position than most people with your same question. Still, taking a MOOC (or even better, a course at your university) in these three subjects may be helpful in demonstrating that you have taken the courses in the form that physicists like to teach them. Research experience is a must for anyone applying to a PhD program in the US, because research is the 'job' you are being 'hired' to do.If your research interests overlap with ChemE, EE, or materials science at all, you might consider also applying to those PhD programs (as a parallel, not alternate strategy) in a school which is liberal about allowing cross-departmental PhD advising. I know of a number of physics research groups that have a student from EE.
