 As someone who works in condensed matter physics, but not specifically on graphene, I am a bit cynical about what is fascinating about graphene because I have heard every spiel 50 times before. A Dirac-like band dispersion? Okay, other materials do this too and have more fun with it. Potential applications in touch screens? Right, everything is transparent if it is one atom thick. An optoelectronic super-material? Call me when you scale the peak of the Gertner hype curve.The one finding that really intrigued me is related to local strains in graphene: gigantic pseudomagnetic fields. When graphene is laid out on a substrate, it naturally exhibits bubbles, wrinkles, dimples, and other local distortions. A certain type of distortion--a triangular bubble--causes electron levels to be quantized in the same way that they would be if they were exposed to a magnetic field of hundreds of Tesla!* For comparison, the magnetic field in a MRI magnet is ~1 Tesla, the biggest DC field that can be produced in a lab is ~25 Tesla, and the biggest useful real magnetic field that can be produced in a lab is ~100 Tesla and this exists only for ~1 millisecond. source: Science MagazineReferences:Strain-Induced PseudoMagnetic Fields Greater Than 300 Tesla in Graphene NanobubblesPseudo magnetic field in strained graphene: Revisited*this is NOT a statement that graphene produces the highest magnetic field ever made. It is a pseudo-magnetic field--the electrons in the vicinity of the defect behave as if they were subjected to a large magnetic field, but no such field is felt outside the sample.
