 I am aware of the term 'optical pumping' being used in two contexts.Producing a laser (this is by far the most common usage)A prerequisite for lasing is population inversion, in which there are more electrons in an excited energy level than in the ground state. Shining light on the system (a.k.a. optical pumping) is a common way of producing population inversion.Producing a non-equilibrium configuration of electrons/atoms/molecules in a sample using a laserIn some experiments, one wants to create a situation which is not thermodynamically stable and watch how it comes back to equilibrium. One way to achieve the former is to shine laser light (often short laser pulses) on a material. This is sometimes called optical pumping (if it uses optical frequencies), especially in the context of a pump-probe experiment.
