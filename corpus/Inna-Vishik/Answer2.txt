 I hate to disappoint the person who asked this question, but my running wardrobe, unlike my real-life wardrobe, is 100% function over form. This means I will wear running shorts that make me looks 20 lbs heavier if they have a zip pocket, and I will wear any hideous color if that article of clothing keeps me at the appropriate temperature. The upshot of all this is I do not wear my workout clothes to the office or to the grocery store (after all, they are ugly, and oh yeah, I actually work out in them).The functional aspects of running outfits I am most serious about are zip pockets, thermal management, and sports bras.I do not like running shorts without zip pockets big enough to hold my phone, and I will not buy a phone which will not fit in my running shorts.

I did not actually pay for these lululemon shorts, as I am not that foolish. The shoes are Saucony Kinvara, and I still like the older models.

Proper support is 100% a solveable/solved problem which is not being presented to and/or being perused by consumers.
