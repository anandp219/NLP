 Condensed matter physics is concerned with 'condensed' phases of matter such as solids, liquids, and condensates. Overall, condensed matter physics veers more towards basic science--trying to understand the nature of many-body-interacting systems--while materials science is more of an applied field, concerned with engineering materials to accomplish a specific function. However, the two disciplines exist on a continuum, with some condensed matter physicists dabbling in applied problems and some materials scientists operating more like physicists.See also: Inna Vishik's answer to How are condensed matter physics and materials science related?Inna Vishik's answer to What are all the major subdisciplines of condensed-matter physics?
