 An experimental physicist is an electrician/plumber on the side, while a theoretical physicist is a mathematician/computer scientist on the side.Most of the domain specific knowledge for experimental physics comes from working in a research lab, not by taking a class about it. Yes, there are sometimes classes (or lab courses) about a specific experimental technique, but it is not a good use of one's time (unless it's required) if you never use that experimental technique. There are also many physics, math, and CS classes that are helpful for physicists, but this is not specific to experimental physics. It should be noted that the background knowledge you need will depend very much on the subfield in which you want to specialize, which is all the more reason to get your feet wet with real research as early as possible if you want to be a physicist when you grow up.
