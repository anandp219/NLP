 Many people succeed at one or more outside ventures while pursuing a PhD in physics, so the first step is to behave like it is a natural thing to do and not seek validation on the internet.How you divide up your time will depend very much on how your research operates (do you have to come in at a specific time? Do you need to produce something to show your adviser every week?), so I can't offer a daily schedule, only general guidance.PeriodizenWith creative endeavors like PhD research, novel writing, and programming (when it is used to produce something, which is probably the best way to learn a new language), it is often not a good idea to work on it just two or three hours at a time. If you are creating something novel (no pun intended), you don't know what your next step is, and you might accomplish exactly nothing in three hours, other than collecting your thoughts. Not to mention how interruptions can further fragment the creative process. Instead, it might work better to prioritize project A for a period of time, say until an impending deadline, and prioritize project B for a period of time after that. For example, if you have an important presentation related to your PhD coming up, you should focus most of your time on that, and maybe use an hour or two in the evening for more 'brainless' activities related to your novel and programming, such as checking for typos and commenting your code. After the deadline related to your PhD research passes, you can try to work shorter days and spend more time on your novel for a fixed period of time.DeadlinesPressure makes diamonds, and sometimes peoples can only be productive if they have a pressing date on which they need to have something to show for their work. PhD research naturally has deadlines (sometimes soft ones) in the form of presentations, papers, applications, referee reports, and the start/end of a semester. If you don't have enough of these to make you productive, you might consider making new ones, such as volunteering to give a presentation at a student journal club or setting up a meeting with someone important that you need to be prepared for. As for your outside interests, those would benefit from real deadlines too (not something soft that you can back out of). Perhaps you could ask someone to read over a chapter of your novel (assuming you are not working with a publisher/editor already), such that you need to actually finish a chapter for them to read. SleepSleep is essential for being productive at creative endeavors, and many young people are delusional about how much they need, thinking they are one of those rare specimens who do fine with 4 or 6. You probably are not one of those people, and if you don't get enough sleep, you will end up wasting those extra two hours sitting at your computer not producing anything.
