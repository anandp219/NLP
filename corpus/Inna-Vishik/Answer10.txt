 When I was an undergraduate in physics many of the exams were HARD (but usually open book, open notes), such that the average grade was well below 75%. No doubt there were some exams which were doable by a majority of the class, but these do not stick out in my mind. This approach has both good and bad points.Good:Real physics problems are challenging, and finding a solution within three hours of seeing the problem is an unnatural occurrenceBecause of the blessings bestowed upon us by the god of partial credit, we were encouraged to try very challenging problems which is helpful for future coursesIt is difficult for professors to come up with exams of the appropriate length and difficulty to be doable in 3 hours but sufficiently challenging to differentiate people who mastered the material better than others, and also not repeat textbook problems or problems from previous year's exams. It is understandable if professors prefer to spend time on other things (teaching is not their main duty in a research university), and as long as they rescale the scores as to not penalize students for this circumstance, no one is hurt.In many of my classes, there were people who were off-the-charts geniuses, but no people who were off-the-charts dunces. A very difficult exam can capture this side of the bell curve better.Bad:Some students will be discouraged, even if the grades are rescaled.The students who are not discouraged may internalize the notion that all difficult exams are meant to be unsolvable, which is a problem if a later course presents difficult looking problems which are meant to be solved completely.Not all difficult exams are created equally. If the 'difficult' problems are really just standard derivations in a later course, this unfairly advantages people who happened to read the more advanced textbook and/or bring it to an open book exam.Thus, arguments can be made favoring both 'impossible' exams and 'challenging but doable' exams. For service courses which are intended for people of all majors, it should probably lean towards the latter. For advanced courses for people in the major, it is probably better to leave this to the discretion of the professor.
