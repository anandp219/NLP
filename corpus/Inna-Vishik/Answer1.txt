 The human voice box (see: Larynx) is a resonant cavity of sorts, which amplifies sounds seeded by vibration of the vocal chords. An analogy of this is a guitar, where plucking the strings produces the initial sound, but this sound is amplified by bouncing around in the body. Helium has a higher speed of sound than air so it tends to amplify higher frequency sounds.The simplest way to think of the voice box (or any resonant cavity) is that sounds will be amplified if you can fit an integer number of wavelengths in the cavity. Lets call the dimension of the cavity L (units=meters). For the case of the voice box, this is presumably varied by the phonal muscles, but keep in mind that our brain has internalized that a certain configuration is required to produce a given pitch. The speed of sound is denoted by [math]v_s[/math] (units = meters/second). Frequency is given by [math]v_s/L[/math] (units = 1/s), so a higher sound velocity will favor higher frequencies for a given cavity size. The speed of sound is 349 m/s in nitrogen (our atmosphere is mostly nitrogen), 326 m/s in oxygen (good quantity of oxygen in there too), and 1007 m/s in helium (see: Speed of Sound in Various Gases). When our vocal chords vibrate during speech, they produce multiple frequencies, and our voice box instinctively conforms to the correct dimension to produce the pitch we are seeking. When the cavity is filled with helium instead of nitrogen and oxygen, the vocal chords and voice box operate as usual, but the higher frequency sounds are amplified more because the speed of sound is nearly 3 times bigger in helium.
