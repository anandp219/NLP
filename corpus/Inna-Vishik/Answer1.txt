 White light (a.k.a. continuum) generation is a nonlinear optical process which can happen when ultrafast pulses of laser light propagate through certain media (examples of such media can be seen/purchased here).The first ingredient of white light generation is the Kerr effect, which causes the index of refraction to be different depending on the intensity of light ([math]n=n_0+n_K I[/math]). A focused pulsed laser has intensity which is variable in space (as any beam would if it is focused to a small spot) and also in time. The second ingredient of white light generation is self-phase modulation, which is a consequence of an intensity-dependent index of refraction coupled with a beam intensity with a strong time-dependence. The rising edge of the pulse will see an increasing index of refraction leading to an increase phase lag, and the trailing edge of the pulse will see the opposite. This instantaneous phase shift will result in an instantaneous frequency shift such that a spectrum broader in frequency than the original is produced.source: Self-phase modulation
