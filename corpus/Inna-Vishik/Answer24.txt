 There are a couple of points in this questions and in the existing answers which need to be addressedCapacitive touchscreensTouchscreens operate like a bunch of parallel plate capacitors, where the capacitance C is given by [math]\epsilon A/d[/math], where [math]\epsilon[/math] is the permitivity of the dielectric material (how electrically polarizeable it is) between the two conducting plates (which are Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) films in the case of most smartphones), A is the surface area of the capacitive element, and d is the distance between the plates. The capacitance relates the amount of charge accumulated on the plates to the voltage between them: [math]C=Q/V[/math]. The position sensitivity comes from having a grid of parallel plate capacitors on the screen, and you can see this grid when you tilt your phone at certain angles in the correct light.Most modern touch screens work by modulating the charge on the plate, not by changing the distance between the plates. You can tell this is the case by trying to use your smartphone while wearing gloves: it simply won't work unless your gloves have conductive thread in the fingertips. Old school touch screens did/do operate by changing the distance between plates of a capacitor, which is why you had to press down hard 10-15 years ago. As such, modern touchscreens respond just fine to metal objects. I tried coins, keys, and bobbypins on my android, and the phone responded to all of them, though the gesture recognition algorithm seemed a bit confused at times.Touch screen mechanism is basically a parallel plate capacitor with (usually) ITO used in both plates. There is an additional external layer to protect the ITO from getting wiped off. image source: Capacitor Stylus pensThere are passive (the rubber tipped pens) and active styluses which operate by very different means. The passive ones can be substituted by a nail if you really want to risk scratching the screen. The active ones are little RF transmitters which give the phone/tablet information about the stylus's location and pressure. The active styluses, when they are operated in conjunction with certain programs or features, use software mechanisms to ignore gestures which do not originate from the pen.
