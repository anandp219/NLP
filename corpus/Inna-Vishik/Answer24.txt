 The NWM in SF is a clusterfuck for reasons that have nothing to do with the focus on women, namely, the lack of proper seeding with respect to projected finish time and the TNT people walking 10 abreast and blocking the entire roadway.Speaking more broadly to the idea of all women's road races, I am in no way against them, but the way they are usually implemented, they turn out to be a celebration of mediocrity. Some people take umbrage at all women's running events because of the girly flourishes--cheap jewelry, truffles, all pink everywhere. I admit this is corny, but so are those races where people are expected to dress in a costume, so women's races are hardly the only culprits. Some people argue that in this day and age, where women already participate heavily in road races and only compete against other women for placement and prizes, all-women's races are a bit superfluous. Perhaps, but many of these races (not NWM) are organized by women-focused athletics brands (which need to exist in the marketplace because women have distinct apparel needs), so it seems more like a natural branding exercise to me. What did piss me off about the women's races I have participated in outside of NWM (and all this was in the bay area, so it may be a regional problem) is that 1) there was an overemphasis on praising mediocre accomplishments, like participating in the first place (is the implication that women are like elementary school children and need to be patted on the head and encouraged at every step?) and 2) the field was not very competitive, even by recreational-runner standards (which is probably related to point 1).This is not to say that all women-focused races suffer from the ills described above. And even for the ones that do, it sure is nice to not have to worry about getting hit by spit and snot rockets during a race!
