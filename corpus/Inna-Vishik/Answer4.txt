 I would let it go, as long as the bad grammar doesn't creep into 'official' communications such as papers and grant proposals (and it almost certainly doesn't). Many professors mispronounce words or make grammar mistakes when they speak, and frankly, from the standpoint of a native speaker, it is not jarring and it does not make them sound less intelligent.My inclination to not correct English grammar mistakes comes from listening to other people (usually not native speakers) correct others' grammar in their presentations. I feel this is not a good use of people's time, and feedback on their content would almost certainly be more helpful. I understand that there are other languages which are much more rigid than English, in which people tend to judge others' intelligence based on their spoken execution of the language. However, English is a more flexible language and it also has a lot more non-native speakers than most other languages. Thus, in my opinion, people come off pedantic when they frequently correct spoken English grammar without solicitation in the context of academia where the speaker is known to be highly educated.
