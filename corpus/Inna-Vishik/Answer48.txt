 All electrons can potentially be ejected via the photoelectric effect (photoemitted), if they are hit with photons of sufficient energy. This includes core electrons in a metal and electrons in semiconductors and insulators too. If this were not the case, the very useful experimental techniques of XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) would not exist. The formula governing photoemission is:[math]E_{kin}=h\nu-|E_B|-\Phi[/math]where [math]E_{kin}[/math] is the kinetic energy of electrons after they have left the material (minimum value =zero), [math]h\nu[/math] is the energy of the light, [math]E_B[/math] is the binding energy of electrons in the solid (more on that below), and [math]\Phi[/math] is the work function of the material. This formula says that the threshold for photoemission in a metal ([math]E_{kin}=0[/math] because threshold, [math]E_B=0[/math] because metals have electrons with zero binding energy) is set by the work function: [math]h\nu=\Phi[/math]. This formula also says that if you want to photo-eject electrons with deeper binding energy ([math]|E_B|>0[/math]), you need to crank up the photon energy.Lets take the case of copper. Based on where it is in the periodic table, one might think it has 9 valence electrons, but actually, its electronic configuration is [math][Ar]3d^{10}4s^1[/math] because elements in the 3d group are weird. The photoelectric effect is something that is usually discussed in the context of a solid consisting of many atoms, not individual atoms, so we must consider the electronic band structure of the solid. A calculation is shown below. I cannot vouch for its accuracy, but I am only using it to illustrate a point. The point I am making is that in a solid, there are electronic bands (sometimes overlapping in energy) originating from the different single-atomic orbitals. In the photoelectric effect any of the occupied bands are fair game for photoemission provided [math]h\nu-\Phi[/math] exceeds their absolute binding energy (y axis of the graph below). The occupied bands correspond to negative [math]E-E_F[/math] in the graph below. Some of the occupied bands might originate from orbitals which one would call valence electrons in an atom, but others do not.In the context of semiconductors, the 'valence band' is the one closest to the Fermi level from below, and electrons from this band will constitute the lowest binding energy electrons which can be photoemitted. However, again, there are bands with deeper binding energy which can be photoemitted with higher energy photons.Band structure diagram of Cu. The right portion is the bands in momentum space, and the right portion is the density of states (DOS), which is more relevant here. The y axis is equivalent to [math]E_B[/math] in the formula above, but only the negative portion (corresponding to occupied states) can participate in single-photon photoemission. The spike in the DOS at -2eV gives copper its color. Image source: Bands diagram using VASP and pymatgen
