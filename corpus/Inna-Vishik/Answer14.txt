 Answering the question itself (not the details): yes, it is possible to change the color of a material gradually and permanently by applying a voltage, and the mechanism I am thinking of is ion conduction.There are materials called 'solid electrolytes' (see Fast ion conductor) which conduct ions, but not electricity, when a voltage is applied. Ions move by hopping from void to void in the crystal structure, and an applied voltage (and possibly an increased temperature) give a portion of the ions sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier for this process. One specific example of a solid electrolyte is Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)(Y2O3+ZrO2), the artist also known as cubic zirconia, where oxygen ions (or the vacancy thereof) can be conducted from one side of the crystal to another by applying a voltage (see images below). Normally, YSZ is transparent, but a different concentration of oxygen and/or oxygen vacancies can change the color by:changing the lattice parameters such that the band gap changesIntroducing 'color centers'--states inside the band gap which absorb light and give the material an increasingly brownish appearance as their concentration increasesReference: V.
