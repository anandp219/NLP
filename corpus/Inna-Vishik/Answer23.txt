 There is nothing shameful about dropping out of a marathon. Powering through legitimate illness or injury on race day just to make it to the finish line (and the ER immediately afterwards) is much more foolish, and in my opinion, an action people should actually be ashamed about. In the absence of such an extreme situation, there is a lot of merit in dropping out after it is clear that you will fall far short of your racing goals, in order to save your legs for another race and/or more training.Elite runners drop out of races all the time because the damage they would do to their body by running an ill-fated race to completion is far worse than the embarrassment they would feel from failing to complete the race. Recreational runners can also adopt this rational attitude and see dropping out as an opportunity to do more training (starting right away because your legs are not as thrashed as they would be if you finished the marathon) and kick ass (however you define it) next time.See also:When To Drop Out Of A RaceThe DropoutWhy did Paula Radcliffe drop out of the marathon?
