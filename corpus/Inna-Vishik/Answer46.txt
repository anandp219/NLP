 My advice is in the context of a race, intended for recreational runners who want to achieve good performance.TrainingIf you formally train for races, there are training plans available online, or you can hire a coach (in person or online). This is not necessarily a requirement for recreational runners. However, you should run to prepare for a running race (not bike, not elliptical, not swimming), and you should not run an entire 5K at race pace during training. If you want to have 5K-pace running in your program, this should be in the form of shorter intervals (400m-1 mile). Running every run in its entirety as fast as possible is a recipe for burnout and/or injury.Longer runs are important, even for a 5K. Professional 5K runners typically have 16-20 milers in their training program. A serious recreational runner might have 10-20 milers. If covering the full distance is not an issue for you and you want to improve your performance, run some 5-8 milers at least.Race daySeed yourself correctly at the starting line. If you have no estimate of your projected finish time, do not line up right at the front, and do not toe the start line unless you are likely to place in the top 10. This is a courtesy to other racers, but you will benefit if you surround yourself by people going at a similar pace. If you are not sure where to stand, ask the people around you their projected finish time and move up/back accordingly.Pace yourself correctly. Do not sprint the first 200m like an 8 year old. You will likely achieve your optimal finish time if you run close to an even pace, assuming consistent terrain.Dress for the occasion. If it is 60 degrees outside, dress like it is 85, because you will get hot as you run. If it is 85 outside (not unlikely since many 5Ks are during the summer), prepare to run slower than you might wish. If you usually run with a water bottle, don't be afraid to carry one during the race, even if people around you don't have them. At the same time, you don't need to pack your gear belt like you are a mule commuting across the desert; a 5K isn't that long.A warmup is helpful for a shorter distance race. This might involve jogging from your home instead of driving (if feasible), or it might involve jogging around the starting area for 5-20 minutes.
