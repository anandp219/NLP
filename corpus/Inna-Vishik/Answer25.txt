 Superconductivity in [math]CaC_6[/math] (graphene layers with calcium atoms arranged in an orderly way between them) is a persistent phenomenon. There is basically one research group in the world which has claimed transiently enhanced (in one case room temperature) superconductivity under certain light-excitation conditions in other materials, and these results are very controversial in the research community. On the other hand, time-persistent superconductivity is a fairly ubiquitous ground state that many materials (some exotic and some mundane) realize at low temperature (and sometimes not super low temperature).Researchers have been thinking about how to make graphene superconduct for a while. Part of this stems from the sexiness of graphene among certain corners of the condensed matter research/funding community. But on the scientific side, graphene (and other carbon-based materials like buckeyballs and diamond) have an attractive feature for superconductivity: high frequency phonons (because carbon is a light atom which tends to form very stiff bonds). Unfortunately, most carbon-based materials are insulators or semimetals, which don't have enough electron density for phonon-mediated superconductivity to happen. This is why carbon-based superconductors need some other source of electrons. Diamond can superconduct if it is doped with a lot of boron. Buckeyballs can form fullerene superconductors when they are arranged into a crystal lattice together with alkali metal atoms. And graphene can superconduct if it gets extra electrons from calcium atoms, and the paper linked in the details studied the electronic structure of these materials using ARPES (see Inna Vishik's answer to What kind of qualitative and quantitative information can be obtained from ARPES?) which were discovered by a different research group and synthesized by a third research group. Superconductivity has also been reported in other graphene intercalant compounds (see this and this)
