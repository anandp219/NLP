 I'm not sure there is a way to state Bloch's theorem simpler than it is already stated--that electrons in a periodic potential (like a crystalline solid) will be characterized by wavefunctions that have the same periodicity as the potential.In physics, you get out what you put in, and your solutions should have the same symmetries as the Hamiltonian and the boundary conditions. In fact, this is how one goes about making progress in quantum mechanical problems which often don't have a closed form solution--they eliminate all the possibilities that don't have the right symmetry.
