 High energy electrons in a TEM absolutely can dislodge atoms, especially if they are on the surface and/or have small atomic number. This usually defeats the purpose of TEM, so people try to avoid it and they tend to publish images where samples have been not damaged (unless the goal of the experiment was to dislodge atoms).This (free) paper gives a very nice overview of various types of radiation (and electrons are radiation in this context) damage which an electron microscope can inflict on a sample.
