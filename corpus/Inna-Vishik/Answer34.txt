 Floating tables are used to damp vibrations for precision optics and microscopy setups and have several levels of vibration isolation.First, the tabletop itself is very stiff and heavy. This limits small deformations and also produces a resonance frequency which is (hopefully) higher than vibrating components on the table.The second line of vibration isolation is 'floating' the table on four pneumatic legs (air pistons) which resist high frequency motion by producing an effective viscous impediment. A similar device which people are probably more familiar with is a damping dashpot which is sometimes installed on heavy doors to make them close more slowly (see image below)--when you try to close these doors faster than they are designed to go, they offer resistance.Image sourcecutout of pneumatic table leg.
