 The best route for making a high salary with a physics degree is to not work as a physicist--instead go into finance or a hot startup. This route is most natural for subfields which are very mathematical (fun fact: not all of physics is super mathematical) and also have a large computational component. If this is what you want to do, be a theoretical physicist of some sort (specific subfield not too important) but not the exclusively pencil/paper kind. Or better yet, don't major in physics if your primary goal is to make a lot of money.If your goal is to earn a good salary (or even a relatively high salary) while working as a physicist in academia (I can't comment on the options, if any, outside of academia), your subfield is not too important, provided it is a field which is expected to stay active in the near future (see: What are the most active fields of physics for graduate students to consider nowadays?). Your probability of earning a decent salary is higher if you end up being a professor (not some soft money position) at a top, private research institution (many public schools are fantastic for research, but the salaries are lower). Some fields have more positions than others, so your choice of subfield does have some impact on your liklihood of becoming a professor. Condensed matter and biophysics (especially experiment) seem to have comparatively good prospects, but other subfields probably do too (if you're really curious, go through all the listings here and see which subfields are most 'employable.') There are physics professors who make very high salaries (e.g. Steve Weinberg at UT austin), but this does not correlate with a specific subfield--it usually correlates with being a top talent in one's subfield and being willing to move for a higher paying position.If you are curious about specific numbers for physics professors' salaries, most public universities in the US publicly list all employees salaries as required by their state's law.
