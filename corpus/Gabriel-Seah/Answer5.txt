 Lance Armstrong get death threats for being unsporting and doping?Indeed, it seems to me that the only ones getting death threats in those instances were the ones who contributed to Armstrong's fall from grace (Is Lance Armstrongs Fate Really Worth Making Death Threats?). So people were upset at those seeking to maintain the purity of the sport (such as it is) more than Armstrong, who broke the rules.In other words, what upsets people isn't really that hunters are unsporting.Romanticisation of charismatic megafaunaRebecca Francis, who posed for a photo with a dead giraffe and got a barrage of death threats after Ricky Gervais condemned her (Huntress becomes 'the hunted' after barrage of death threats over kill selfies), noted thatthe animals I have taken with a bow include: a 10 1/2 ft. brown bear, black bear, shiras moose, alaskan moose, dall sheep, stone sheep, desert bighorn ram, rocky mountain bighorn ram, mule deer, whitetail deer, elk, mountain goat, antelope, arapawa ram, kudu, zebra, black wildebeest, giraffe, springbuck, blesbuck, lynx, badger, and squirrel(Rebecca Francis giraffe photo causes storm - CNN.com)Yet, it seems that what got the most attention was the giraffe, which is telling.Gervais's tweet is also revealing:What must've happened to you in your life to make you want to kill a beautiful animal & then lie next to it smiling?At least some of the hate, then, comes from the animal being "beautiful".Thinly-disguised bashing of rich peopleThe rich are one of the seemingly few groups that it is okay to hate nowadays, and it is clear from the subtext of many of the comments that this sentiment is present.One clear example is the journalist Piers Morgan who said that,I will sell tickets for $50,000 to anyone who wants to come with me and track down fat, greedy, selfish, murderous businessmen like Dr Palmer in their natural habit.(Piers:Id love to hunt with Walter Palmer so I can stuff and mount him)Nevermind that Palmer is not fat. Nor is he a businessman. And there doesn't seem to be any evidence that he is greedy, selfish or murderous (by definition you can't "murder" an animal).He is a hunter, so he must be a corporate fatcat!Similarly, the ban on fox hunting in England is at least as much about class as protecting foxes from cruelty (Fox hunts thrive in Britain, but class-tinged controversy won't go away).Generalised online misanthropyBy now if you're not living under a rock you must have heard about at least one Internet witch hunt.The glee expressed by many people as they fantasise about torturing Walter Palmer is really disturbing. For example:Truly. I'd put a cross bow bolt through Walter Palmer then track him from 40 hrs, shoot him, behead him, skin him and sleep peacefully.(People Are Flooding This Dentist's Facebook After He Was Named As The Hunter Who Killed Cecil The Lion)Even if they don't want to kill him, they certainly want him ruined.Sharon Osbourne tweeted of her hope that he loses his home, his practice & his money (before noting: He has already lost his soul).(Who's Really Killing the Lions of Zimbabwe?)As a New York Times article observed,Perhaps she had now come to understand that her shaming wasnt really about her at all. Social media is so perfectly designed to manipulate our desire for approval, and that is what led to her undoing. Her tormentors were instantly congratulated as they took Sacco down, bit by bit, and so they continued to do so. Their motivation was much the same as Saccos own  a bid for the attention of strangers  as she milled about Heathrow, hoping to amuse people she couldnt see(How One Stupid Tweet Blew Up Justine Saccos Life)Basically, people are just looking for targets to bash and hate, especially in the Internet age where hating on people is something of a performance art.PostscriptTo some constituencies, Walter Palmer is a hero.By shooting Cecil the Lion he saved the lives of about 250 antelope Cecil would've eaten over his life.Cecilia the Lion killing an antelopeAs well as any cubs Cecil would've killed if he'd taken over a pride (Why killing infants can benefit animals).Meanwhile, humans die all the time but this rarely attracts attention (People are upset over the reaction to the deaths of a human in Calais and a lion).Perhaps some "animal lovers" really just hate humans.
