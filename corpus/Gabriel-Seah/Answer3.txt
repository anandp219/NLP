 Adapted from: Gabriel Seah's answer to Why are people so upset about the killing of Cecil the lion?It depends on why they oppose hunting.If they oppose hunting because of animal cruelty, it is hypocritical.The vast majority of those against hunting for sport happily eat meat, and factory farming is far more cruel (Farm Animal Cruelty) - it's just that you don't see or imagine it, so it's out of sight, out of mind.If it's alright for countless animals to suffer their entire lives just to give you some momentary pleasure from their meat, what is the suffering of a few animals to give a hunter his own pleasure?What is the moral difference between the pleasure of eating meat (which is not necessary for human survival) and the pleasure of hunting which makes the former acceptable but not the latter?Hens in a cage. Battery hens live in these for an average of 18 months, almost 329 times as long as the 40 hours Cecil the lion took to dieThere aren't good reasons to oppose hunting, but that's not due to hypocrisy over meat-eating.See: Gabriel Seah's answer to Why are people so upset about the killing of Cecil the lion? for more
