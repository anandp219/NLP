 It depends.As Scott Lowe points out, delisting a site is the main sanction UNESCO can visit upon a country (with the attendant negative publicity and loss of prestige, tourism money and restoration assistance).UNESCO has, of the writing of this post, delisted only 2 World Heritage Sites:Dresden Elbe ValleyArabian Oryx SanctuaryDresden was struck off the list due to the building of the Waldschlsschen Bridge, which "meant that the property failed to keep its "outstanding universal value as inscribed"" (Dresden is deleted from UNESCOs World Heritage List).Meanwhile, the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was deleted from the list because Oman reduced its size by 90% (Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary : first site ever to be deleted from UNESCO's World Heritage List).Basically, UNESCO World Heritage sites should not be substantially affected, such that the criteria under which they were inscribed are affected. It is quite shameful for a site to be delisted, and the idea is to deter sites from being substantially affected by development (or some other human intervention) so UNESCO gives warnings before delisting a site.The removal of the murals looks to be at least partly a political issue as they first came up during the 2011-2014 term of the previous mayor Susana Villaran (a rival to the current one Luis Castaneda) (Lima's mayor confesses to cover-up of downtown murals).UNESCO does not seem to have condemned the murals or threatened Lima with being removed from the list and has even said they do not interfere (unless there is "imminent risk" to cultural heritage; Lima murals: Not part of mission of Unesco to inferfere).In my evaluation, it is doubtful that if there were many murals, the character of the Historic Centre of Lima might be affected unless the murals, say, covered the facades of historic buildings like the Torre Tagle palace (which I find very unlikely).
