 Neither. This is a category error.At least according to Abrahamic mythology, angels are generally spiritual beings with no gender (an earthly concept)."Jesus says of the angels that they do not marry (Matthew 22:30) and it is the standard Christian view that they are pure spirits without bodies (Hebrews 1:14, compare with Luke 24:39). This would seem to imply that angels are neither male nor female."- Angels: A Very Short Introduction / David Albert Jones"Because angels are spirits, they have no sex and real angels are neither male nor female"- Angels in the Bible / Elaine Murray Stone, Cathy Rayburn"Angels have no bodies, therefore no biological gender"- Angels and Demons: What Do We Really Know about Them? / Peter KreeftIn Christian art, angels have been portrayed as both male and female, depending on the context, but this is how they are perceived/reveal themselves, rather than revealing their "true gender" (so to speak).Judaism seems to be a bit more complicated, with angels being seen as androgynous in some thought systems and as male-female pairs (syzygies) in others (The Kabbalistic Teachings of Jesus in the Gospel of Thomas / Lewis Keizer).Similarly, God is neither male nor female, as these are earthly concepts that do not apply to the realm of the divine.
