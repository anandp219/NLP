 They mean that they disagree with what you say, but instead of showing how you are wrong they will pick through your demographic characteristics one by one until they find one that denotes membership in a "privileged" class.Ipso facto, you are irrevocably wrong and they have won the argument.Example:A (male): Women don't really earn less than men.

You are male and thus wrong.
