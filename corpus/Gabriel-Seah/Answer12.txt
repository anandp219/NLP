 The short answer is that you can't really do that.News outlets are free to publish what they want and, at least in a free country, there's no easy way to force them to be entirely truthful (instead of peddling half-truths).If what they have published is technically true, as in the Gawker story, one would not be able to hit them for defamation (or libel, where the name depends on the jurisdiction). And in the Gawker story it's not entirely clear what sort of damages the family would be able to prove anyway.Probably the best way to mitigate the trend of misleading news articles (which feeds into the clickbait phenomenon which is ultimately driven by ad revenue [Taboola: The internet firm at the forefront of 'click-bait' - BBC News]) is to employ critical news literacy. If a story sounds too "good" to be true, it probably is.And then, you can do several things:- Write in to the publication to complain. Make your voice heard as a reader. At the very least this will annoy them.- Post the truth in the comments section. Heartwarmingly, the 4th and 5th comments on the Gawker post highlight how misleading it is and present the critical information we need to fully evaluate this story.- Recommend/like/promote/upvote comments by others which highlight the truth.- Comment when friends share these stories (since these stories are made to be shared so as to get more views and thus ad revenue). This will improve their critical media literacy.This won't do a lot on its own, but if enough people do something at least the tide of ignorance will be countered (slightly). And if nothing else you will know you're doing something to fight it.
