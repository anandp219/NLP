 When I was 17, my classmate related to me what happened when her former schoolmates (in an all-girls school) received their GCE O level (a nationwide examination) results."Happy also cry, sad also cry" (translation: When women are happy, they cry. Yet, when they are sad they also cry.)Crying releases energy and feelings, and might even release stress hormones; it can also get you sympathy and support from others. Furthermore, women cry more than men, especially those "who report anxiety, as well as those who are extroverted and empathetic" (Why We Cry: The Truth About Tearing Up).Not coincidentally, anxiety is what is felt when anticipating the results of a beauty contest (or nationwide examinations, as in my previous example), and beauty pageant contestants would be more extroverted and empathetic than the general population.
