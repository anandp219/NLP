 No.As a general rule, don't look at the results of one or two studies, but the results of multiple studies. If you can find a meta-analysis, that's even better.Also be aware of observational studies (which look at population behavior) - while they can be useful they are subject to confounding factors. For example, it was once thought that Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) reduced cardiac risk in post-menopausal women, but this was because women who took HRT had higher socioeconomic status, which itself protects against coronary heart disease (Commentary: The hormone replacement-coronary heart disease conundrum: is this the death of observational epidemiology?). Similarly, just comparing drinkers of diet soda with drinkers with normal soda will not be helpful, since those who drink diet soda are likely to be overweight in the first place (which is why they drink diet soda...)The gold standard is randomised controlled trials (RCT) where the experimental variable (what you want to test) is manipulated.As it turns out, there are several meta-analyses about artificial sweeteners.One found that ,data from RCTs, which provide the highest quality of evidence for examining the potentially causal effects of LCS intake, indicate that substituting LCS options for their regular-calorie versions results in a modest weight loss, and may be a useful dietary tool to improve compliance with weight loss or weight maintenance plan(Low-calorie sweeteners and body weight and composition: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies)Another found there wasn't a lot of good research (A systematic review on the effect of sweeteners on glycemic response and clinically relevant outcomes) but what there was showed that these sweeteners reduced calorie intake and test subjects lost more weight than those consuming sugar.On a more micro level, various studies on zero-calorie sweeteners (Do Artificial Sweeteners Cause an Insulin Spike? | Mark's Daily Apple) examining various types of artificial sweetners (aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame K and sucralose) found that they had no (or at most a marginal) effect on insulin.Some studies linked artificial sweeteners to cancer, but they had methodological problems (Real or fake sugar: Does it matter?) and so were invalid.There is a recent study which seems to show that artificial sweeteners are bad for you (by causing insulin resistance).Artificial sweeteners induce glucose intolerance by altering the gutmicrobiota by Suez et al (2014), gave mice and humans artificial sweeteners and their gut bacteria changed and their glucose tolerance became poorer (Page on the-scientist.com).Yet, the sample size for the human trial was only seven (7) - which is one of the smallest (if not the smallest) sample sizes I've ever seen in a trial. Furthermore, the results were all due to saccharin, and the humans consumed "the FDAs maximum acceptable daily saccharin intake" for a week (equivalent to 40 cans of diet soda a day). This does not resemble real world conditions, since most people don't consume so much artificial sweetener (let alone saccharin). (More critiques: expert reaction to non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) and glucose intolerance)All in all, zero calorie soda (aka diet soda) is safe for health - but it'll be good to minimise your consumption of those containing saccharin. Luckily, most diet sodas use aspartame (Real or fake sugar: Does it matter?) so there isn't a problem here.
