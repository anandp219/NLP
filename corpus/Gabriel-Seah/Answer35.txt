 The Communist Party of China hasn't always whined (a curious term - I would say whipping up hatred is more accurate) about Japan.No less a figure than Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Communist Party of China and the founding father of the People's Republic of China, half-jokingly half-thanked Japan for invading China during World War II:When Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka visited Beijing in 1972 to restore Japan's relations with China, a country that had been devastated by Japanese military aggression in the 1930s and '40s, his host Mao Zedong allowed himself a moment of levity. Responding to Tanaka's apology for what Japan had done during the war, Mao answered that there was absolutely no need to apologize. After all, he said, without the Japanese invasion, the Communist revolution would never have succeeded.Secure in his nationalist credentials, as the leader who unified China, Mao could afford this little joke, which also happened to be the truth.(A Dangerous Rift Between China and Japan)Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai warmly welcoming Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka(Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou Meet with Japanese PM Kakuei Tanaka -- china.org.cn)In 1978, Deng Xiaoping, the father of modern Communist-in-name-only China, visited Japan and happily shook the hand of the Prime Minister, Takeo Fukuda.Deng Xiaoping and Takeo FukudaIndeed, the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty read:China is striving to build itself into a modernized socialist power. We need a peaceful international environment and we are willing to develop friendly and cooperative ties with all countries. Despite different social systems in China and Japan, the two countries should and can coexist in peace and friendship(http://www.china.org.cn/english/...)To know why the Communist Party of China has so much antagonism against Japan today, it is illuminating to see when its attitude towards Japan changed.Basically the year that marks the watershed is 1989. Not coincidentally, 1989 was the year of the Tiananmen protests in China. With the Party abandoning its Communist ideology, the unifying national ideology was to be "patriotism", i.e. stirring up historic grievances against other countries to unify the People under the banner of the Party:The party blamed Tiananmen on dangerous foreign ideas and the mission of public history became to demonstrate that foreigners had been behind the countrys major setbacks since the early 19th century. The people were to be persuaded that the party was all that stood between China and foreigners ill-intentions and that Chinas long history and superior culture made it an exception to the widely observed phenomenon that, once they achieve a certain standard of living, people tend to demand a say in how they are governed.(China: at war with its history)It is also instructive to see how the Communist Party manages anti-Japan protests today: it actively encourages and suppresses them, according to the vagaries of domestic politics (internecine party politics also play a part here):The protests come when the leaders need one to come, and the protests will stop when they want them to stop...Mistaken for protesters, two journalists passing by were met by plainclothes police officers and instructed on where to go to more effectively protest.(Beijing both encourages and reins in anti-Japan protests, analysts say)Such cynical manipulation of anti-Japanese sentiment gives the lie to the simplistic claim that Japanese atrocities during the war are the primary reason for the Communist Party of China's stoking of anti-Japanese sentiments among the Chinese people.One of the millions of victims of the famine caused by the "Great Leap Forward" - initiated by Mao Zedong
