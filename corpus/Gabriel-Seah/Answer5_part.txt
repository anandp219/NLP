 Most anti-hunting sentiment is due to a combination of:- romanticisation of charismatic megafauna- thinly-disguised bashing of rich people- generalised online misanthropyThe reaction to the killing of Cecil the Lion is no exception, and is similar to past reactions when Ian Gibson was trampled to death by an elephant (Game Hunter Trampled To Death By Elephant), Rebecca Francis killed a giraffe (This woman smiled after shooting a giraffe, and the Internet is outraged) and Kendall Jones posted pictures of herself smiling beside dead African game (Uproar over cheerleaders trophy hunts posted on Facebook).Perhaps there was some slight increase in outrage due to the hunt being illegal and Cecil being famous, but really how many non-Zimbabweans had heard of Cecil before his killing, and why does legal hunting also upset people?Let us look at some of the reasons typically given to justify outrage at this kind of hunting and hunter: conservation, animal cruelty and sportsmanship.ConservationCecil was a member of the species Panthera leo, the African Lion, which is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Panthera leo (African Lion, Lion)).That might sound worrying, but Gadus morhua (Atlantic Cod) is also Vulnerable (Gadus morhua (Atlantic Cod, Cod, Codling, Haberdine, Kil'din Cod)) and most people have no problems with eating it. Ditto with lots of other species of seafood (10 Fish You're Eating That Are Endangered Species).The Giant Gippsland Earthworm - Endangered on the IUCN Red List (i.e. more endangered than the African lion) and the poster child of no conservation campaignsFurthermore, hunting for sport can in many cases actually be *good* for threatened species.Hunters spend a lot of money, which stimulates local economies, and encourages locals to conserve wildlife so hunters can come and shoot animals.Indeed, the legalisation of white rhino hunting in South Africa was responsible for the population exploding from less than 100 to more than 11,000 (Can trophy hunting actually help conservation? - Conservation). Elephants in Zimbabwe have also benefited from hunting.Animal crueltyThe vast majority of those against hunting for sport happily eat meat, and factory farming is far more cruel (Farm Animal Cruelty) - it's just that you don't see or imagine it, so it's out of sight, out of mind.If it's alright for countless animals to suffer their entire lives just to give you some momentary pleasure from their meat, what is the suffering of a few animals to give a hunter his own pleasure?What is the moral difference between the pleasure of eating meat (which is not necessary for human survival) and the pleasure of hunting which makes the former acceptable but not the latter?Hens in a cage. Battery hens live in these for an average of 18 months, almost 329 times as long as the 40 hours Cecil the lion took to dieUnsportsmanship-like behaviorThis is a somewhat more interesting objection.This objection to hunting goes along the lines of it being "unfair" for people armed with modern weaponry and other technology (and usually with support staff) to go up against animals only equipped with teeth and claws.And thus it is not a sport.One might question what fair play might involve.Should the hunter arm himself with a rifle without scopes and/or night vision devices?Should the hunter not camouflage himself?Should the hunter arm himself with a spear - no firearms?Should the hunter only use his bare hands?Yet, hunted animals are physically stronger, probably faster and definitely better equipped with natural weapons than humans.Just what should hunters do to give animals a sporting chance?Similarly, is it sporting for athletes from developed countries,- benefiting from nutrition and sport science- who can afford to train full-time- train at high altitudes to increase their red blood cell count- using the latest aerodynamic bodysuits (Under Armours secret Olympic mission: Build a faster speedskating suit) and- who have expensive personal trainers and coachesto go up against athletes from developing countries who- have day jobs- train barefoot on dirt tracks- are malnourished and- compete in simple jerseys?Really, all this fuss about hunters being unsporting is moot since we don't get upset when people are unsporting in other areas.Did
