 The draft isn't totally ended in the US - under the Selective Service System, male US residents between 18 and 25 (Registration - How the U.S. Draft Works) are required to register.Legally if you don't register you can be jailed and fined but in reality you lose a lot of government benefits.That said, the nature of activism is that one is always focused on what is wrong or problematic, rather than what has been done.For example, the UK has been rated the best place in Europe to be gay (UK is 'best place in Europe' to be gay), and Europe in turn is surely the best continent to be gay. Yet, in the same breath, Stonewall (a LGBT "professional lobbying group") adds that "We must not underestimate how much work there is yet to do".This can also be seen in feminism, the mirror image of men's rights activism. After all the victories of feminism, in the developed world it is now essentially about First World Problems. Yet, you wouldn't know this from seeing how upset feminists get about women's issues. As Hanna Rosin observes, The closer women get to real power, the more they cling to the idea that they are powerless. To rejoice about feminist victories these days counts as betrayal.(Feminists, Accept It. The Patriarchy Is Dead.)Activists are reluctant to acknowledge that things are good because they lose their raison d'tre, funding, political capital, the power of victimhood (Psychology of Victimhood, Don't Blame the Victim, Article by Ofer Zur, Ph.D.) and/or a sense of righteousness, which can be intoxicating.That said, from what I've seen of MRAs they don't seem to be saying that despite the effective end of the draft things are going from bad to worse, but that the draft aside things aren't very good (and are possibly getting worse).
