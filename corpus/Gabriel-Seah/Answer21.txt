 There're 2 issues here:1) Why did he think you were transgender (or a man)?2) Why did he not believe you and block you?In turn,1) Why did he think you were transgender (or a man)?Your face shape looks mannish, your nose is rather big, you look like you have a big frame (especially given the lack of other women to compare you to for scale), and I don't really see a figure (biological men don't tend to have a pronounced figure - ergo why the euphemism 'boyish' is used for girls without much of a figure)Also your hair doesn't look very natural, but this point is a bit complicated because black women tend to use hair weaves or wigs.In addition, the photos all obscure your throat - he might have thought you were trying to hide an Adam's Apple.Also you could have said things in your profile that sounded like they were written by a man (or transwoman).2) Why did he not believe you and block you?He was convinced that you were a man/transwoman, perhaps from some of the possible signs outlined above, which is why he didn't believe you.He might have had bad experiences in the past with men or transwomen on dating sites pretending to be bona fide women, or might have been just terrified about that possibility. On top of that he didn't find you(r profile) attractive enough to at least give you a chance.You could feel offended but life is generally too short to go around getting upset at people about everything. I'm sure you have more important things to worry about than one unreasonable person on a dating site.
