 Yes they are.Indeed, more animals are killed on a vegan diet than a diet based on "plant-based agriculture and a forage-ruminant-based agriculture".This means that to kill the least amount of animals, one has to eat meat.The reason for this counter-intuitive conclusion is that,Production of forages, such as pasture-based forages, would cause less harm to field animals (kill fewer) than intensive crop production systems typically used to produce food for a vegan diet. Ruminants (cows, sheep, goats and deer (i.e. animals that can graze)) don't kill as many animals as digging up a field, planting crops, applying pesticides, harvesting etc.Source: The Least Harm Principle may require that humans consume a diet containing large herbivores, not a vegan diet
