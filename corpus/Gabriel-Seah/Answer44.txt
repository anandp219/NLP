 In the US, yes.In fact the US has so many lawyers that it is hurting the economy.In a 2010 paper (The Optimum Number of Lawyers and a Radical Proposal for Legal Change; Page on buckleysmix.com), Magee looked at 27, 33 and 40 countries and estimated the economically optimal number of lawyers.Of course, the US - at 2.15 lawyers per 1,000 people, has more lawyers per capita than everywhere else except Uruguay, and four times the global average, was found to have too many.In 2007, US GDP was $565 billion lower than it would've been - due to the excess of lawyers.
