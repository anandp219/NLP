 China officially has a high literacy rate of 96.4% (CIA The World Factbook 2015).However this rate is misleadingly high, and illiteracy is actually quite common.As long as you pass a fourth-grade exam, you are considered literate, even if later you are no longer able to read or write (Illiteracy Jumps in China, Despite 50-Year Campaign to Eradicate It). You only need to know 950 Chinese characters you are considered literate, but as Victor Mair, Professor of, Chinese Language and Literature at UPenn notes,we know from pedagogical standards outside of China that this figure is woefully inadequate for functioning as a literate member of a society that uses Chinese characters for daily communication in a variety of fields, literature, news media, instructional manuals, high school and college textbooks, and so forth.(The cost of illiteracy in China)Pinyin.info looks at a 1996 study which actually tested a national probability sample, and a high estimate of the literacy rate was about 76% (as opposed to the official figures of 85%) (Chinese literacy). Once one weights this for population and the ability to write (which is, after all, half the definition of literacy) it is evident that the official literacy rate in China is misleadingly high.This being China, there is also concern that officials are inflating the figures. As it is with GDP growth, so it is for literacy statistics.China's poverty and large rural population surely have something to do with its illiteracy rate, but the written language definitely plays a part as well. It is instructive that many languages (e.g. Vietnamese, Korean) used to be written with Chinese characters, but transitioned to other scripts, partly to promote literacy (Vietnamese Writing System, History of Hangul Part I).It is also revealing that in China and Japan, young people are losing their ability to write Chinese characters without help (from their computers or phones) and thus are essentially illiterate (When Chinese children forget how to write - BBC News, Wired youth forget how to write in China and Japan). This suggests that Chinese characters are hard to connect with the spoken language, which impedes literacy.Sure, Chinese characters might be beautiful - but beauty doesn't aid either communication or literacy.For more on the difficulty of Chinese characters: Why Chinese Is So Damn Hard
