. When a man is licentious, his genitals are to be cut off(Source 5)(I find this bit puzzling given how open China historically was about prostitution - perhaps someone else can shed light on it)At one point premarital sex was officially grounds for expulsion at all Chinese universities (Chinese universities may alter tough sex rules) and at one sex between men and women was labelled prostitution (Guangdong college says all student sex is 'illegal prostitution', threatens expulsion).An instructive comparison can be made with another, nearby East Asian country - Japan. Japan is a highly repressed society, and it is theorised that the popularity, ubiquity and outlandishness (or perversion, if you prefer) of Japanese pornography (JAV) stems from this repression.Materialism and Income InequalityThe materialism and income inequality of modern China also contribute to prostitution's popularity.The phenomenon of materialism is much discussed, and was neatly epitomised in a (female) contestant on China's most popular dating show proclaiming that "I'd rather cry in a BMW car than laugh on the backseat of a bicycle" (Page on time.com).Meanwhile inequality meanss that, especially for rural women in the cities, prostitution is a rational choice:The postsocialist trafc in women has given unprecedented commercial value to the nubile bodies of rural women who come to the city seeking work. As many of them quickly learn, it is hardly worth it to take a respectable but low-paying job as a maid when the likelihood of rape by an employer is so high. One young bar hostess put it this way: Dalian men try to cheat both our bodies and emotions. Without spending a cent, they get what they want from us. The only way to avoid being tricked, used, and abandoned, said another, is to protect yourself by making sure you get enough money for the sex you sell to men (Zheng 2009:220)... bar hostesses in the post-Mao era present themselves primarily as lial daughters serving their parents. They see doing sex work as a rational choice: it earns the highest return on the capital they have to invest (Zheng 2009:147-171).(Source 4)A close parallel to the openness of prostitution in China is its mistress culture, which is similarly widespread and open (Inside Chinas Mistress-Industrial Complex), and whose concurrent popularity (and openess) spring from similar reasons.One Child PolicyThe one child policy has led to a shortage of women in China and By 2030, projections suggest that more than 25% of Chinese men in their late 30s will never have married(Why Chinese men are the most single in the world: the perils of gender imbalance in China)Naturally, if there are many men who cannot find wives, the demand for prostitution will go up.Even a Chinese official who advises the state on population issues has noted that an uptick in prostitution is an inevitable consequence of the One Child Policy (40m bachelors and no women ... the birth of a new problem for China).CorruptionCorruption is widespread in China, and it is easy to bribe officials to turn a blind eye (Prostitution is Key to Reducing Corruption in China). Some are even actively paid by the sex industry.Indeed, sex is part of the currency of corruption in China, with officials being "paid" with sex (Double standards on prostitution enrages blogosphere | Asia | DW.DE | 20.02.2014).With such vested interests by many levels of government (and the promise of a quick buck by closing two eyes), it's no wonder prostitution persists.(Long Format) Sources:1) Sex in China: Studies in Sexology in Chinese Culture / Fang Fu Ruan2) China's Policies toward Illegal Drugs and Prostitution in the New Era: Struggle within the Global Context / Bin Liang, Liqun Cao in Modern Chinese Legal Reform: New Perspectives / ed Xiaobing Li, Qiang Fang3) Licensing Leisure: The Chinese Nationalists' Attempt to Regulate Shanghai, 1927-49 / Frederic Wakeman, Jr. 4) Gender and Sexuality in Modern Chinese History / Susan L.
