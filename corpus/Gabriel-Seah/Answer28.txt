 A basic definition of religion would be to follow Edward Burnett Tylor:Religion is a belief in spiritual beings.In this case, feminism is not a religion since it does not talk about the spirit world.Nonetheless, it has many characteristics of a religion, and specifically a religion in the Judeo-Christian tradition, among which are:- The concept of (Original) Sin surfaces as that of Male Privilege, which is something that can never be fully cleansed and for which one must feel guilty (John Scalzi, "white male privilege", and original sin)- It has a bogeyman that is blamed for everything that is wrong in this world. Instead of Satan/The Devil, it is "patriarchy"- It has an assumption of infallibility and a refusal to question its basic assumption - that of "patriarchy"- There is fierce internecine dissent among its adherents about what seems (to outsiders) to be relatively minor ideological (theological) points, and condemnations of those who have sinned and fallen short (Theres no point in online feminism if its an exclusive, Mean Girls club)- Feminists condemn others as "not real feminists" or otherwise contest other people's adoption of the feminist label - this is like claims that specific Muslims aren't "true Muslims" or the chiding of "Sunday Christians"- There is an eschatological promise: of a Utopia when Patriarchy is finally dismantled and the feminist paradise arrives- There is a perpetual fallacy of pointing to what feminism is in theory rather that what it is in practice. Ditto with religion
