 The literacy rate in China is high because the bar for "literacy" is incredibly low in China.As long as you pass a fourth-grade exam, you are considered literate, even if later you are no longer able to read or write (Illiteracy Jumps in China, Despite 50-Year Campaign to Eradicate It). You only need to know 950 Chinese characters you are considered literate, but as Victor Mair, Professor of Chinese Language and Literature at UPenn notes,we know from pedagogical standards outside of China that this figure is woefully inadequate for functioning as a literate member of a society that uses Chinese characters for daily communication in a variety of fields, literature, news media, instructional manuals, high school and college textbooks, and so forth.(The cost of illiteracy in China)Pinyin.info looks at a 1996 study which actually tested a national probability sample, and a high estimate of the literacy rate was about 76% (as opposed to the official figures of 85%) (Chinese literacy). Once one weights this for population and the ability to write (which is, after all, half the definition of literacy) it is evident that the official literacy rate in China is misleadingly high.This being China, there is also concern that officials are inflating the figures. As it is with GDP growth, so it is for literacy statistics.
