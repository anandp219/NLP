 There's a line from a later West Wing episode around the time Bartlet is running for a second term:You say that these numbers mean dial it down. I say they mean dial it up. You haven't gotten through. There are people you haven't persuaded yet. These number mean dial it up. Otherwise you're like the French radical, watching the crowd run by and saying, "There go my people. I must find out where they're going so I can lead them."Bartlet is trying to strike a balance between kowtowing to populism and the status quo and advancing the public conversation in America towards his liberal ideas, which is the kind of progress he knows he needs to make to leave a lasting intellectual legacy as President. This is difficult as he is, in his words "a human starting gun." This is why he's losing sleep - his inability to come up with a strong, unique brand of leadership that can help affect change. His arc over the course of this episode contrasts neatly with the VP Hoynes' refusal to play ball with the White House on a tied ethanol vote, and helps highlights the relative incapacities of the President's office in taking a principled stand.In the final scene when they're on the phone, Bartlet expresses admiration for a past instance in which Hoynes spoke for an unpopular position on ethanol in Iowa, a position he re-asserts during the episode as the White House tries to get him to vote against his position to break the tie.Hoynes, still Presidential hopeful, is getting to sleep at night. Bartlet, actual President, isn't. (Compare this with what Josh Lyman once said - the campaign is poetry, governing is prose)
