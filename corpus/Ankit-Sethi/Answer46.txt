 Journalism is not dead. And Buzzfeed is not, I repeat for emphasis, NOT crap.If you haven't taken a moment to scratch the surface and actually measure the quality of Buzzfeed's reporting for yourself, please take a moment now to do so. Their longform journalism is pretty great. Some big names from older generations of media have made their home at Buzzfeed and the site is giving them the space and platform to write great stories.See links here for more: American Journalism Review, CUNY Graduate School of Journalism - CUNY Graduate School of Journalism , Three lists about BuzzFeeds serious journalismThey have some ways to go still but it is clear that Buzzfeed's business model is actually working (=making money), which makes it a rarity in the current media climate. Memes and quirky quizzes sell and Buzzfeed is using those revenues to subsidize the creation of great journalism. If that's what it takes to keep journalism alive then bring on the quizzes.Another point in favor of Buzzfeed would be its notable progressive values in giving women, trans-people, and people-of-color a front and center voice. No other journalistic institution of comparable visibility comes close in matching Buzzfeed in the racial, gender and sexual diversity of voices it encourages and targets content towards.Among old media, a very chosen few will have the distinguished status and loyal consumer base to put up paid subscription models, have somber intellectualism as their metier, and still continue to remain in the black.
