 While issue boils down to consent and necessity, the answer to this question depends on the exact situation.First, establishing the following as facts: Sexual intercourse is not a necessity but food and nutrition is.Both cases, bestiality and killing an animal for food, occur without the consent of the animal.Any unnecessary killing of sufficiently advanced animals (a class that includes cows and other livestock) is morally wrong.Proceeding from here, we take up the case of most western countries which have the plentiful availability of vegetarian food options that makes eating meat unnecessary. In such societies, if people are okay with non-consensually killing animals but not okay with non-consensually having sex with them, then that's a clear double standard.In however, say, a remote Inuit settlement that is critically dependent on hunting for survival, it would not be a double standard for them to eat meat and yet keep bestiality outlawed. The non-consensual killing would be necessary and hence not a moral wrong while the bestiality (non-consensual by definition) would still be wrong since it cannot be a necessity.
