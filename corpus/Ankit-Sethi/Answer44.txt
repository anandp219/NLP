 The show was unknown to the general public and it made sense for the pilot to be a bold grab at people's attention.If you're on the fence about watching a pilot, but then you learn that the episode description goes: "Terrorists kidnap royalty and demand the British PM have sex with a pig", you are going to watch that show. That's good TV right there.I think also that National Anthem aspired at broader commentary compared with the focused studies on death, memory or justice, that characterize the later episodes. National Anthem has themes of geo-political terrorism, masculinity in crisis, family melodrama, authenticity in film, social media and performance art. It really tries to check a lot of boxes, if you think about it. And that's a good way to appeal to a lot of different interests that people have.
