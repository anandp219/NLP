 Cult is not a genre any more than box-office flops are a genre.Cult as a concept is circumscribed by the following ideas:Commercial earnings: a financially successful movie is disqualified from being a cult hit by definition. The number of average filmgoers unaware of the movie counts towards its bonafides.Aesthetic considerations: something judged to be too ahead of its time or too odd to pigeonhole helps make it a cult filmPersona: if a director or actor maintains a select but ardent following through a unique public image and personal vision, middling films of theirs can be reevaluated as cult filmsRetroactive nominations: throwaway fare from a bygone era and often possessing a sensibility naive by contemporary standards is sometimes "rediscovered" for its ironic pleasures and deemed to be a cult object.Foreign films that receive a modest screening in a home country by some fortunate accident; mediocre domestic films that are syndicated on national television and catch on -- all stand a chance of becoming cult films.Quentin Tarantino has watched a wide array of films and his knowledge of various film traditions is superlative. His own films draw from many such traditions, examples being the sphagetti western, the samurai subgenre of Jidaigeki, Hong Kong kung fu, Blaxploitation and many others.His own status as cult figure is questionable past the time of Pulp Fiction's release. Of his films, Reservoir Dogs can perhaps still claim to be merely a cult film. Right now though, he is way too well known for any of his films to enter the cult canon.
