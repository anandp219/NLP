 tacks, no one is talking about the the generations of women in their 30, 40s and 50s who are stuck in acrimonious loveless marriages. Marriages which might be violent or marriages where the spouse might just be sexually distant and unavailable (or simply philandering with the maid). Where the couple might not have had sex since their last child was conceived, which might have been a decade ago. Or even widows who are now expected to be sexless and partner-less the rest of their lives since their children are grown up and settled and why, after all, would a woman want sex at that stage? I personally know of people whose parents' marriages are in such doldrums (or perhaps 9th circle of hell would be more apropos). For women in such marriages, who have perhaps never given a thought to prioritizing their own well being over family appearances, it would be a vital and crucial idea for them to start thinking about having an affair with mutual consent with a partner that can make them happy.The overall problem, I feel, is that Indian people's anxieties about dating in the modern age tend to make them think of romantic coupling as (in part or whole) an adversarial endeavor while completely ignoring the great role adultery can provide as a pressure valve in so many hellish relationships among the older arranged-marriage generation which actually are adversarial and absolutely horrible and torturous. Fears of the other, darker side of the "Dating" system manifest themselves here - a shiny car we've (as a culture) started test driving with aplomb but neglected to read the operating manual fully. The solution is not to create an environment of self-righteousness about adultery as some kind of social insurance policy in case we're on the receiving end one day, but to realize that it is contingent upon ourselves to choose a partner and build the kind of relationship where it would never come into the equation.The rest of the piece is worth little remark except to say that it unfortunately indulges in the same kind of adversarial world view of modern relationships that I just advocated against. The problem being that the audience for this video would include women and men who broadly agree with its message but would take offense at the tone, as if the humdrum things being talked about, like when to have a baby or when one should come home at night is so out of the realm of possibility for a couple to achieve mature understanding upon, that it becomes a point of defiance and Amazonian courage. It talks down to the men and women it is primarily speaking to, with some bamboozling poetic fancies in the mix, and so alienates people who would broadly agree with what it is trying to champion. The gender equality issues that are a terrain of politics and negotiation within couples of the Indian middle class are, at this point, a little beyond the zeroth order stuff presented here. There is little talk of sharing chores, of the domestic work being respected as much as professional work, regardless of which spouse is doing it, there is little talk of pay disparities and the negotiations couples must have about who works and which city one lives in and whose career is best prioritized, how in-laws' expectations might need to be readjusted according the progressive values the couple might share, about the need to be each other's allies while doing that, what the effects of workplace sexism on payscale and advancement are, how simple things like lack of public toilets or streetside harrasment affect women's mobility. Brass tacks again! In centering the experience of women around their size, their sex life, their spouse and their snowflakiness, Vogue erases real concerns about how life is lived in India beyond the traditional domestic concerns a woman might have.
