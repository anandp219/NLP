 As a recent ex-grad student who is a two-time TW, all I can say is that Quora helped me be social at a time when I was unable to connect with anyone in my grad program or university. The people I used to meet were way too nerdy for my taste, shared none of the non-academic interests I had, and forming emotional bonds with them proved difficult. After I started writing heavily here I found like-minded individuals, many of whom became closer friends of mine than any I have or had at my university.
