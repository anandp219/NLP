 This is not addressed in the episode exactly, but the Indonesian leader (Sugardo) in the episode seems to be clearly modeled on Suharto, the controversial Indonesian President who held office from '67 to '98.At the time the episode was written, Suharto would have been very recently ousted from a 31 year long stint in power marked towards the end by violence, nepotism, corruption and pandering to Islamism, so the references to political oppression are timely and appropriate. (*)That bring us to the state dinner and what Indonesia did to deserve it. Throughout the Cold War, Indonesia was publicly neutral but privately aligned with the US. Suharto had a strong anti-Communist agenda and the Russians even had an arms embargo against the country. So there are at least a few decades of positive foreign policy relations behind the scenes there. Indonesia was also a founding member of the regional collective ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). It also keeps bearing in mind that Indonesia grew massively under Suharto to become a strong regional power and given how close it is to China, the US and Indonesia have good reasons to continue to cooperate, specifically on their mutual goal of containing China's influence. (**)To sum it up, Indonesia's past and (then) present alignments on foreign policy probably helped ensure that their President got a state dinner. The only confusing bit is that if you go by the year the episode is set in, President "Sugardo" should already have been thrown out of office.(*) - I'll regard Donna's throwaway line "they summarily execute people they suspect of being sorcerers" as a bit of dime-store orientalism.(**) - For a post 9/11 episode, there would be the additional factor that Indonesia has the world's largest population of Muslim people, a population that is tolerant and pluralistic, and that holding up such a role model is just good diplomacy for an America trying to promote democracy in the Middle East.
