 There's an episode of The West Wing where Josh Lyman is negotiating with a Republican congressman hoping to sway his vote and get an important measure passed. The carrot offered to the congressman, who is gay, is that the gay marriage agenda will be helped out if he votes against his party. He refuses and Josh is incredulous. "But...you're gay. Why would you not want this?"The climactic answer is that the congressman is not a single issue voter and despite his orientation does not agree with Bartlett's left wing economics in the proposal.The reason this counted as a dramatic reveal is the answer to your question. It's generally rare for people, minorities or not, to not be single issue voters.Feminists might disagree with Democrats on many issues but they would care about gender issues enough to support them anyway.
