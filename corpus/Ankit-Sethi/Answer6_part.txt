 Anti-Americanism proceeded in several stages as outlined in a very nice review by Professor James Caesar at Page on syr.edu, which I have briefly summarized below: "Degeneracy thesis": Even before the founding of a country by the name of America, European thinkers proposed that the New World is "degenerate" due to its atmospheric conditions such as high humidity. The chief propagators of this theory were biologist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon as well as writer of a three-volume study of America, Cornelius de Pauw (who said "it is a great and terrible spectacle to see one half of the globe so disfavored by nature that everything found there is degenerate or monstrous.")In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton writes:Men admired as profound philosophers gravely asserted that all animals, and with them the human species, degenerate in America that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed awhile in our atmosphere.Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson later wrote long responses refuting these claims, battling perceptions summarized by writer Guillaume Thomas Franois Raynal as: "America has not yet produced a good poet, an able mathematician, one man of genius in a single art or a single science."An Intellectual Basis: Proceeding from these naturalist objections, Anti-Americanism then shifted to an ideological foundation - the argument that the basic values upon which the country was founded were profane or suspect. Conservative philosophers who disagreed with the principles upon which the French Revolution was based, ideas of man and equality, looked to the American Revolution as a precursor worth equal derision. People like Joseph de Maistre and Edmund Burke found the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution suspect and thought the country could not endure on these values for long. Maistre said:"All that is new in [America's] constitution, all that results from common deliberation is the most fragile thing in the world: one could not bring together more symptoms of weakness and decay."Romantic thinkers also objected to the idea of a society based on reason, believing that no real culture or nation could be founded on such principles. The poet Nikolaus Lenau said:"With the expression Bodenlosigkeit [rootlessness] I think I am able to indicate the general character of all American institutions; what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme." while another Romantic poet Heinrich Heine suggested:"Sometimes it comes to my mind/To sail to America/To that pigpen of Freedom/Inhabited by boors living in equality."Racial Impurity: By the 19th century, theories about the hierarchical divisions of the races and their differing abilities led to another strain of Anti-Americanism. The view, best captured by the writings of Arthur de Gobineau was that America was supposed to have been the Great White Hope for the Anglo-Saxon
