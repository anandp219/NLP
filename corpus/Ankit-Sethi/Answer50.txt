 A very small minority of people decide after careful reading of canonical texts, scholarly and popular critiques, historical overviews of people, controversies and events, that feminism is too problematic a term for them to identify with it.These people I grant a pass on believing in WE but not wishing to be called a feminist.Everyone else is trying to have their cake and eat it too. That is to say, I picture them cheerily agreeing to the most obvious objectives of feminism ("They should be able to get jobs!" "We need to stop rape!"- no shit bro), while not desiring to engage with deeper structural issues that will require them to think hard, possibly about their own past roles and actions, as well hold somewhat unpopular opinions or occasionally be a buzzkill at parties.The WE people are content to brandish a bulleted list of bon mots, while I see feminists at least trying to tackle its full cultural heft, warts and all.
