 As Roger Ebert said in his review, Eastern Promises is a movie not about "what or how, but of why."So, essentially, noirish thrillers with a big reveal (not necessarily a "twist") at the end will stand you in good stead. Something like Shutter Island, perhaps.For similarity of tone, an earlier Viggo-Cronenberg collaboration named A History of Violence is quite good, and has similar elements of organized crime.An early Coen Brothers movie named Miller's Crossing also springs to my mind - an excellent gangster film.
