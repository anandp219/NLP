 Answering for most procedurals, an additional reason they are consistently interesting because they explore different and often relatively unknown subcultures and professions that exist in American society. Crime is a fruitful lens through which to do this because crime can affect any kind of person and the investigation usually immerses the viewer in the victim's unique socio-cultural milieu for the length of the show.To give an example, I remember watching CSI episodes about circus performers, strippers, biker gangs, Deaf people, model train enthusiasts, sci-fi conventioners and so on, and finding the salient details about these lives quite intriguing and worth the time. It's kind of the same reason I really liked Hardy Boys books when I was younger.
