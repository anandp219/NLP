 The rubric that makes sense to me is that: a piece of work can be great only if it utilizes its medium such that it cannot be remade into any other medium.For a visual novel, I would say that one of the conditions for it being considered great would be that it integrates into something more than the sum of its panels and balloon text. If it didn't, i.e, it could work as well as a movie or a novel, then it's not a really great visual novel.I'd actually asked a question about this thought and its significance to comic books a couple of years ago and I'd gotten a response that can serve as a great example of what I mean:Douglas Currens' answer to What are some great examples of comic books that fully utilize the medium?Promethea #32, the final issue of the series, while full of images and comments and "dialogue" on every page, was ALSO designed to be cut apart and reassembled into two very large 16-page portraits of Promethea! Take THAT, comics collectors with your mylar snugs! In order to properly see the "larger picture," you had to destroy the smaller "world" of the comic itself. A perfect summation of the universe-ending protagonist of this Alan Moore classic! It must have been amazing making the art and preparing this issue for printing! Here's one of the 16-page portraits...In addition, the artistic styles of the earlier issues were often tributes to famous artists, and the color scheme changed according to the part of the Kaballah's Tree of Life Promethea was visiting in those issues. Pretty amazing!
