 No, based off the facts of this episode, the commuting of the death sentence would have been viewed as President Bartlet abusing his executive powers in the service of his personal Catholic beliefs. There was no legal reason to do so, there was no technicality to exploit and convicted persons are usually screened extensively by the Office of the Pardon Attorney for a demonstrated ability to become responsible citizens on return to society, a point featured prominently in a later pardon episode The Benign Prerogative. Nor could the such a plot turn have been shrugged away by the next episode. This Simon Cruz plotline was just about examining the struggle between Bartlet's Catholic beliefs and the demands of his office, a recurring theme for the character.
