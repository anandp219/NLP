 Anti-Americanism proceeded in several stages as outlined in a very nice review by Professor James Caesar at Page on syr.edu, which I have briefly summarized below: "Degeneracy thesis": Even before the founding of a country by the name of America, European thinkers proposed that the New World is "degenerate" due to its atmospheric conditions such as high humidity. The chief propagators of this theory were biologist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon as well as writer of a three-volume study of America, Cornelius de Pauw (who said "it is a great and terrible spectacle to see one half of the globe so disfavored by nature that everything found there is degenerate or monstrous.")In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton writes:Men admired as profound philosophers gravely asserted that all animals, and with them the human species, degenerate in America that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed awhile in our atmosphere.Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson later wrote long responses refuting these claims, battling perceptions summarized by writer Guillaume Thomas Franois Raynal as: "America has not yet produced a good poet, an able mathematician, one man of genius in a single art or a single science."An Intellectual Basis: Proceeding from these naturalist objections, Anti-Americanism then shifted to an ideological foundation - the argument that the basic values upon which the country was founded were profane or suspect. Conservative philosophers who disagreed with the principles upon which the French Revolution was based, ideas of man and equality, looked to the American Revolution as a precursor worth equal derision. People like Joseph de Maistre and Edmund Burke found the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution suspect and thought the country could not endure on these values for long. Maistre said:"All that is new in [America's] constitution, all that results from common deliberation is the most fragile thing in the world: one could not bring together more symptoms of weakness and decay."Romantic thinkers also objected to the idea of a society based on reason, believing that no real culture or nation could be founded on such principles. The poet Nikolaus Lenau said:"With the expression Bodenlosigkeit [rootlessness] I think I am able to indicate the general character of all American institutions; what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme." while another Romantic poet Heinrich Heine suggested:"Sometimes it comes to my mind/To sail to America/To that pigpen of Freedom/Inhabited by boors living in equality."Racial Impurity: By the 19th century, theories about the hierarchical divisions of the races and their differing abilities led to another strain of Anti-Americanism. The view, best captured by the writings of Arthur de Gobineau was that America was supposed to have been the Great White Hope for the Anglo-Saxon and Nordic races, but with its Enlightenment ideals was headed in the direction of mingling and lowering the Anglo-Saxon race with the "garbage races" of Europe. Although racialist theories have been debunked, some of Gobineau's analysis is retained, used to argue that America fosters a culture of "blandness and homogeneity," while others complain that the amalgamation promised has not proceeded fast enough.Resistance to Modernization: "The breathless haste with which they [the Americans] work-the distinctive vice of the new world-is already beginning ferociously to infect old Europe and is spreading a spiritual emptiness over the continent." said Nietzsche about America industry, its mass production and mass industrialization. Later a disciple of his Arthur Moeller van den Bruck wrote that Americanness should be "not geographically but spiritually understood" and that it is "the decisive step by which we make our way from a dependence on the earth to the use of the earth, the step that mechanizes and electrifies inanimate material and makes the elements of the world into agencies of human use."Consumerism: In 1935, German philosopher Martin Heidegger (who previously had said that America waskatestrophenhaft, the site of catastrophe) wrote:Europe lies today in a great pincer, squeezed between Russia on the one side and America on the other. From a metaphysical point of view, Russia and America are the same, with the same dreary technological frenzy and the same unrestricted organization of the average man.But Heidegger believed that Russian Bolshevism was only a variant of Americanism and considered Russia less of a problem than America because there could at least be dialogue with Marxists since they had a sense of history, while America had none. What was essentially going on was that several strands of thought that were threatened by everything commodified and mass produced wanted to create an anti-technological agenda but since "technology" was not enough of a real thing for people to hate, seized upon the idea of America as a symbol for everything that's wrong about where progress was taking us. Heidegger went on to say:"Consumption for the sake of consumption is the sole procedure that distinctively characterizes the history of a world that has become an unworld.... Being today means being replaceable." He also cited Rainer Marie Rilke's thoughts about America:Now is emerging from out of America pure undifferentiated things, mere things of appearance, sham articles.... A house in the American understanding, an American apple or an American vine has nothing in common with the house, the fruit, or the grape that had been adopted in the hopes and thoughts of our forefathersOne may note that these ideas are common even today among people of all ideological inclinations, even those who would balk at being associated with the proto-Nazism of Heidegger.
