 The part that gets me about that episode is the bluntness with which Leo told his wife that for these few years, yes, his job is more important than his marriage. Its function is to set up early on the conviction by which he and the staffers live their lives. Everyone has a sense that in those 4/8 years, they will get a once in a lifetime chance to do something special. As the episodes go by, characters sometimes lose sight or forget but they always come back to this.Leo did not try to negotiate or say something less than what he meant. Idealism sounds great when it's fiery rhetoric but it takes a quiet scene where the rubber hits the road to show that he actually believes it.
