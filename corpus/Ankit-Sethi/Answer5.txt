 If you've seen the TV show Friends, you would remember that Joey often says "JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD" when someone tries to reach for what he's eating. I have the same problem with people eating out of my plate or sampling items I've purchased and I always just tell them that I'm like Joey in this regard and that they need to back off or I'll start to get mad like he does. The allusion to a comedic moment they probably laughed at in the past injects just enough ambiguity about the my level of seriousness to take the edge off my very real threat while still driving the message home.
