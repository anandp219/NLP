 One aspect not mentioned so far is that magical realism has a politics associated with it that surrealism does not.Incubated in Latin America, and adopted in places like the Indian subcontinent and Eastern Europe, magical realism has historically tried to dilate reality to highlight what is bizarre - and specifically - unjust about those societies. Think issues of class, race and colonialism.Surrealism is not quite so political, or rather tends to embody a more personal struggle against restrictive social structures and a revolt against conventional thinking and logic.While magical realism has been used by writers in diagnosing maladies in their culture, surrealism, insofar as it was used to advance a politics, was used in a more prescriptive sense as a way for art to support the values of anarchism and communism.
