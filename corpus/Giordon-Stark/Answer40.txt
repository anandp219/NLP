 CERN has released an Open Data initiative with some data sets: CERN Open Data PortalNote that due to the incredibly large size, CSV format is highly inefficient. They use ROOT formats, which you would need to learn how to use. There are plenty of tools for this.In particular, the large amount of data necessitates a smarter organization. Now, the ROOT files have what is called a StoreGate where the raw data is stored in a structure of arrays sorted by type. This means that all raw data treated as ints are stored in one array while raw data treated as floats are stored in another. Then, there's an interface on top of the StoreGate which is smaller and understands where to find the data because it pre-computes pointers to objects stored in the StoreGate to retrieve them, rather than storing the actual value itself.Because of the added complexity, you will need specific C++ classes developed for this specific access if you want to take advantage of the newly-implemented object-oriented approach to accessing data in a much faster way.
