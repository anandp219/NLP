 myself when I'm on the go to remind myself to do things... Now I set Reminders.And finally this is where bundling has saved my life. Inbox allows me to bundle everything related into a single group, so whenever a new message comes in that goes into the group, all email messages in that group jump to the top of my inbox because it's chronological! This allows me to quickly see new actionable items without having to scroll, or dig through things that are arbitrarily classified as Important. Instead, Bundling allows me to have nearly infinite levels of Importance!How do you manage giant email threads?The best way is to always comment to things inline, so that the conversation is broken up by paragraph or actionable items. I provide an example below.replies inlineOn Thursday, February 19, 2015, Giordon Stark wrote:Hi Marco, now I definitely have some questions that need to be clarified, maybe I missed the memo.On Thu Feb 19 2015 at 12:14:34 AM Marco Milesi wrote:Hi peeps,I have merged my devbranch to the trunk. Here are the major changes:1) fixed ConstDataVector, const xAODContainer issues in all Muon* and Electron* modules2) changed all passSel flags from int to char in all Muon* and Electron* modulesAwesome, thanks.3) in JetCalibrator, added possibility to extract flag "simulationFlavour" to use correct calibration for MC (NB: need to define flag for each sample in your job steering macro)Can you elaborate on this? Shouldn't this already exist in the MetaData tree? You do something similar to extra other information in BasicEventSelection (which might need to be renamed).This apparently is the only way to do the job outside of Athena, unfortunately. I already asked to PAThelp and they confirm... 4) Now mcEventWeight is extracted in BaseEventSelector first, and is retrieved by all the EL algorithms downstreamCan you explain why you're grabbing the event weight this way instead of using the recommended  eventWeight = eventInfo->auxdecor< float >( "eventWeight" );Did I miss something? What is the extra complexity in here for?In the xAODAnaHelpers Twiki it is said it is preferable in terms of performance to use SG:: Decorator and Accessor. Originally I had the same thing as you said. Who wrote the section on the TWiki about that?5) general restyling of OverlapRemover. Implemented a template function in HelperFunctions to fill the output ConstDV (can be reused w/ slight changes by any EL algo)Does the template just basically deal with making subsets for a given flag? What's the point of "tool_name" here? If you don't mind, I might try cleaning up the template a bit (eg: I'm not sure we need all the declarations below, since the compiler should fill it in for us based on what the code uses and we could potentially combine it into one type)In the OR tool, the logic of the Overlaps flag is reverted. Basically an object flagged as "overlaps" should not be pushed back to the output ConstDataVector, whereas an object flagged as "passSel" should. Since the aim of the template function is to be usable by any selector, I opted for having an exceptionfor the OR case, at least until Steven does not revert the logic of the "Overlaps" flag.6) added enum in HelperClasses to classify "containerType". This replaces "ints" for m_type. See OverlapRemover for a working example.Everything compiles in Base,2.0.25.However, I get a crash at runtime b/c some passSel flags are still ints and not chars. Could anyone who worked on selectors double check he/she updated to the new type convention?I can check this.That would be awesome, thanks!As you can see, the original email is the one most nested in and my responses are bolded, and you can see Marco's responses to my responses, and you can read the full conversation from each block. This is a fantastic feature that Google has always supported. It's a wonderful habit and it allows me to really focus on key items of the email without having to scroll up and down to read old replies and so forth. In this example, this is an email chain of a ROOT Software Framework I work on within ATLAS that we're building up to prepare for Run-2 Analysis and Supersymmetry studies.Google automatically actions items for meMost people don't know about this feature... but I can't live without it.There is a provided API for anyone sending email to add meta-data that specifies a link to quickly take action on an email. I mentioned this before and I'll mention it again. Emails are like newsfeeds and a lifestyle. They represent conversations in my life that I'm involved in and they should always move towards making it easier for me to connect with life. Not force me to use it. Emails are reminders. They tell me what needs to be done, and I do it. And then archive when I'm done. It keeps me going. I keep it going. It's a symbiotic relationship.
