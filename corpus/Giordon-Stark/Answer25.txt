 Given a right-angle triangle with side lengths [math]x[/math] and [math]y[/math] in appropriate directions. There are two different angles you can calculate:[math]\theta_\text{horiz} = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)[/math][math]\theta_\text{vert} = \arctan\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)[/math]and unsurprisingly, you will find that [math]\theta_\text{horiz} + \theta_\text{vert} = \frac{\pi}{2} = 90^\circ[/math]. As the problem is currently written, it's not clear if there are pictures associated with it or whether they want you to find the angle with respect to horizon or vertical for each part.
