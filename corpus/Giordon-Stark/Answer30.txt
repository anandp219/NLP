 There are three cases to consider with this electric dipole in fields. First, let's just deal with treating the whole thing in 2D and only talk about an electric field. What happens to the dipole? It undergoes a torque.We have an electric dipole of [math]\vec{p}[/math] with the two charges separated by [math]d[/math] in a uniform electric field [math]\vec{E}[/math]. Now, if it's at an angle [math]\theta[/math] with respect to the electric field, then this will feel a torque [math]\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}[/math]. This torque causes the dipole moment to rotate about its center in the electric field. Define the origin to be at the center of this rotation. [math]\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E} \qquad \left|\vec{\tau}\right| = p E \sin \phi[/math]Just to put in direction, let's say that the velocity [math]\vec{v}[/math] of the particles are in the [math]\hat{\phi}[/math] direction (positive = counter-clockwise). Then [math]\hat{\phi} = -\sin\phi \hat{x} + \cos\phi \hat{y}[/math].What happens if the magnetic field is in three configurations? Or rather, in three different directions: [math]\hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z}[/math]?Since the force on the particle due to the magnetic field is [math]\vec{F}_B = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B} \qquad \left|\vec{F}_B\right| = q v B \sin\phi[/math]Simple cross-products give us an idea of the direction of the force. [math]\hat{\phi} \times \hat{x}[/math] = [math]-\cos\phi \hat{z}[/math] [math]\hat{\phi} \times \hat{y} = -\sin\phi \hat{z}[/math] [math]\hat{\phi} \times \hat{z} = \sin\phi \hat{y} + \cos\phi \hat{x}[/math]When [math]\phi = 0, \hat{\phi} = \hat{y}[/math] and when [math]\phi = \frac{\pi}{2}, \hat{\phi} = -\hat{x}[/math]. Let's look at maxima and minimum. The torque is a maximum at 90 degrees, and zero at 0 degrees.If the magnetic field is aligned with the electric field (both in the [math]\hat{x}[/math] direction), as the force via torque on the charges due to electric field decreases, the force on the magnetic field increases in the [math]+\hat{z}[/math] direction (right-hand rule) on both charges. As the dipole swings past through [math]\phi = 0[/math], the force on the magnetic field is a maximum and then starts decreasing, but still points in the [math]+\hat{z}[/math] direction. When it changes direction and goes back towards [math]\phi = 0[/math] from [math]\phi^-[/math], the magnetic force is in the [math]-\hat{z}[/math] direction so the dipole is being pulled down. Therefore, it will oscillate up and down through the [math]xy[/math]-plane while it spins in the [math]xy[/math]-plane quite symmetrically. When it spins counter-clockwise, it goes up. When it spins clockwise, it goes down.If the magnetic field is in the [math]\hat{y}[/math] direction, as the force via torque on the charges due to electric field decrease, the force on the magnetic field decreases in the [math]-\hat{z}[/math] direction (right-hand rule). When it hits [math]\phi = 0[/math], the magnetic force is zero and then switches direction to be in the [math]+\hat{z}[/math]. When it turns around to go back towards [math]\phi=0[/math], it is in the [math]-\hat{z}[/math] direction, and passing zero, it flips to be in the [math]+\hat{z}[/math] direction. It will appear to be oscillating more rapidly. When it spins counter-clockwise, it goes down until it passes through [math]\phi=0[/math] in which case it goes up. Then when it turns around and spins clockwise, it will go down again until it passes through [math]\phi=0[/math] in which case it goes up. It will appear to be bouncing up and down like a parabolic trajectory with the minimum corresponding to [math]\phi=0[/math]If the magnetic field is in the [math]\hat{z}[/math] direction, the magnetic force will be aligned parallel or antiparallel to the dipole moment. In fact, as it spins through [math]\phi=0[/math] to [math]\phi = -\pi/2[/math], the force will point towards the negative charge (parallel to dipole moment). When it turns around back towards [math]\phi = +\pi/2[/math], it will point towards the positive charge, antiparallel the dipole moment. All the motion is constrained to the [math]xy[/math]-plane. Just thinking about it, the center of the dipole moment should be moving in a U-shaped (hemispherical) path back and forth, while the dipole is spinning about the center of the dipole moment due to the torque applied. The magnetic field does not change the orientation of the dipole, but shifts the center around, so the dipole in the electric field will appear to be spinning in its rest frame normally, the addition of the magnetic field adds a new rest frame.
