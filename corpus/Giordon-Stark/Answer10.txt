 You can. It's just not going to help you a lot.You can use Gauss's law for the electric dipole. What it will tell you is that [math]\oint \vec{E} \cdot \text{d}\vec{a} = 0[/math]which tells you that the net flux through any surface enclosing your charges is zero. This does not actually tell you anything about your field because we haven't solved the left-hand side. The net flux outwards through some portion of the surface balances the net flux inwards through some other portion of the surface. To put this in perspective, [math]\int_0^1 \sin(2\pi x) \text{d}x = 0[/math]does not imply that [math]\sin(2\pi x)[/math] is zero everywhere on the interval.However, as Brian correctly pointed out, you need to really apply some sort of symmetry to make that surface integral evaluate nicely for you to figure out, at least, the magnitude of the electric field.Instead, you deal with Poisson's equation [math]\nabla^2 \phi = \rho[/math] which gives you the flexibility of not requiring symmetry to easily solve it (although it does help). You can apply this by defining your two point charges separated by a distance [math]d[/math] for a physical dipole (a pure dipole is one where [math]d\to 0[/math]) but we can approximate a physical dipole correctly as long as we measure the electric field at a point [math]r \gg d[/math]. All that is left is to define our boundary conditions and we can pretty much guarantee that a solution that solves this equation and satisfies the boundary condition must be the solution.
