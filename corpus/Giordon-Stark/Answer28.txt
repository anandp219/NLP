 None.So umm... this is one of those times I wish I had a different answer. The only way I've been learning ROOT is through example code that gets passed down to me, or asking questions to other people who use ROOT, such as my colleagues. Googling for answers often brings up lots of guides, but many of them don't really show you the right way or the easiest way, just the way they learned how to do it... which is unfortunate.It's very.. very hard to self-teach ROOT. There are so many hacks and tricks to get it to work right that it's not really worth the effort. What is worth the effort is using PyROOT instead, or the Athena C++ libraries (and frameworks) meant to interface with the ROOT data. ROOT6 is coming, and perhaps that will be much better, but only time will tell. It might a better investment of your time to learn Python or C++ (C++11 is awesome) as packages like SpartyJet or FastJet are built purely for specific kinds of optimizations and centrality.Apart from that, the header files of ROOT are not that bad to follow, and the online documentation, while shitty, at least has a pretty good listing of all possible functions: ROOT Reference Guide.
