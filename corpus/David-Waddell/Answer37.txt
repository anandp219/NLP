 All our lives have intrinsic value, in and of themselves.But that aside... most of us will satisfy ourselves with being 'good enough' at something. It's not necessary to be the best. Someone needs to win the silver medal. Someone needs to win the bronze and someone needs to cross the line in 4th position to make the bronze medal worthwhile.All of us have a role to play in our lives. Sometimes that is to be the best, sometimes it is to push the best onto the podium. Sometimes it is to help others, and sometimes it is to be helpless, to allow life's helpers to meet their raison d'etre.
