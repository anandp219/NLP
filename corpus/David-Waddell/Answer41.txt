 (British-centric answer)There is a great reel of examples here: Page on telegraph.co.ukThe answer is both yes and no, depending on the context and the publication. As I see it, these are the factors at play:Is the publication favourably or unfavourably disposed to the politician in question? Some papers have a clear interest in showing their favoured political leader in a good light and others awkwardly eating a bacon sandwich. Some papers and broadcasters (particularly in the UK) will tend to select pictures showing a much more straightforward image.Is the photograph one which is so unusual that it merits a story in and of itself? Consider Boris Johnson on the zip-wire, for example, or President GW Bush being pecked by a pardoned turkey, or David Miliband with his banana. Those are such cracking moments in time they fairly deserve their moment in the sun, or in The Sun even.Does the story demand a more serious treatment? I would expect even the Daily Mirror to choose a reasonable shot of David Cameron to illustrate its VJ Day coverage, for example. It just wouldn't do to select an unflattering comedy shot to illustrate such a serious story. But there is a grey area, and it's not uncommon for a paper of the left to show pictures of David Cameron or George Osborne apparently snarling or laughing at the plight of the poor, or for a paper of the right to show an equally unflattering picture of a Labour leader to illustrate other serious political news stories.While I think it can be unduly unfair or deceptive to show especially unflattering pictures of politicians, I think most readers are likely to see through it. It says more about the publication than about the leader in question.In my working role for the BBC I select video material for news output. If I see material which is comically unflattering, I may well try to find a place for it, but I am cautious about this and never seek to distort the news agenda in my choice of pictures.
