 I'll go with George Clooney, as an intelligent, educated American global citizen, well respected both in the US and around the world and someone who has actively campaigned on both domestic and international issues.He seems to be a Democrat, who supports Hillary Clinton, though that support hasn't been unconditional and he has documented criticisms of her.Helpfully, he is not shrill with regard to what he campaigns on. He may be leftish, but he seems much closer to the centre ground than the far left, and his pronouncements on the issues he cares about are both articulate and measured.
