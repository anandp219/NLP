 The only significant cohort of people who want another border poll in Northern Ireland are the DUP (UK unionists who are content with the status quo). They are convinced that the electorate is with them and that a new referendum would merely strengthen Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom.Irish nationalists or republicans are not - at present - angling for another border poll. They continue to work towards the reunification of Ireland, but they do not believe such a referendum would be helpful to their cause - at the present time.
