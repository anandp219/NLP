 As Franklin Veaux has pointed out, "telling your partner not to talk to other men is extremely crosses dive and controlling." I fully agree, but it seems from the wording of your question that you are merely telling your girlfriend you don't like it. And you're entitled to share that information.I sympathise with your plight. I would have no objection to my wife retaining cordial relations with her exes, but I think it's reasonable to put some distance with previous BFs/GFs upon entering a new monogamous relationship. Certainly talking to someone every day and using pet-names seems a bit much.She's entitled to talk to whoever she wishes. You're also entitled to put your own boundaries in place. If she values her relationship with you over the relationships of her past, she will respect your boundaries.
