 If I felt close to someone and believed they too considered me a close friend, I would attend their funeral if I possibly could. Funerals tend to be public events, so I should not need an invitation in order to feel welcome.However, in the circumstances it would be normal to expect an invitation (or at least information) from the family organising the funeral. If they did not see fit to get in touch with me, I would probably feel that either (a) the deceased did not consider me close, (b) the family did not consider me close or (c) a key family member did not wish me to attend.If that happened, I would (a) feel left out, quite literally, and (b) would be unable to mark the passing of my friend in the traditional way. Both factors would therefore upset me.
