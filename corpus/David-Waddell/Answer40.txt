 The lowest earners are not levied income tax.Other low earners are levied income tax at a lower percentage than high earners.The workless are given practical and financial support to find work.Those in need of a home that they cannot afford are given housing benefit and those in greatest need are given priority social housing provision.Steps are being taken to bring online more social housing, by (a) building more homes, and (b) encourage people with social homes bigger than they need to trade down.Child benefit is offered to low and middle income families.The NHS budget has been protected to enable it to continue to care for those (most of us) who cannot afford their own healthcare provision.Public sector jobs are distributed across the country in ways designed to boost employment in the poorest areas.The current Conservative Govt will borrow 75bn (approx) in the current financial year to deliver the above.The Govt is working towards a more sustainable budget to avoid impoverishing our descendents with a crippling debt burden or a sovereign debt crisis. Now... you may not agree with some of the ideas outlined above. You may think some of the measures don't go far enough, or that we should thank other parties for some of the policy measures currently in play. But they are currently being delivered by the incumbent government, and they are widely (if not unanimously) supported by the MPs of the governing party.I have my bugbears about MPs right across the political spectrum, but I contend that literally no-one goes into politics to crush the souls of the poor, and virtually all MPs have a sympathetic understanding of the plight of their constituents, particularly the poorest and most troubled who fill their surgeries.Conservative solutions and those of the OP may be very different. But it does not mean Conservatives view or treat the poor as sub-humans.
