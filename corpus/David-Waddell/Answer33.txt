 Speedometers are rarely 100% accurate. Normally they over-read slightly. In the UK, I understand, they are allowed to over-read by a few per cent, but must not under-read.I often use engine braking approaching speed limit signs, and trust the speedometer to give me the assurance I'm driving/riding at a legal speed upon entering the new zone. To my own personal experience, it seems to me the speedo is giving a reasonably accurate reflection of speed both when accelerating and decelerating. I drive a VW Golf and ride a BMW GS motorcycle. Other vehicles may vary.
