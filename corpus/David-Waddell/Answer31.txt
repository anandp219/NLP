 IMHO, she can lose the nomination, and I would consider betting on that if the odds were good enough. But in all probability she will win the nomination if she plays her cards carefully. That's the primary challenge, literally, winning the primary contest.Traditionally, it's understood that US presidential nominations are won on the left or right, before the general election is fought on the centre ground. Hillary, through sheer force of inevitability, has managed to avoid a messy battle for the leftist primary support, but needs to remember that not a single vote has yet been cast. For me, Mac Tan's answer hits the nail on the head, with regard to the impact of the #BlackLivesMatter campaign and how it's been handled by Hillary.She has, it would seem, the luxury of being able to focus a little further ahead towards the main presidential contest, because she's picked up such a huge virtual* lead in the primary contest. In fact, it may even help her credibility in the primaries if she's seen as a potential general election winner. At the moment she looks more likely than anyone else, Democrat or Republican to be installed as the USA's 45th President in January 2019. And that, in itself gives her strength in the primaries.* I repeat - not a single has yet been cast!
