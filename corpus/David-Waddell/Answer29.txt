 The BBC didn't say this, though we may have reported the ambitions expressed by ISIS. In fact I cannot find a link even to that reportage, although I see it elsewhere.Is it realistic? I think it is important never to rule out scenarios entirely. Let's measure them all with probability. I won't put a figure on it, but I think it's highly improbable that ISIS's territory will expand much beyond its present borders. Certainly as they press north into Turkey they will find the full might of Nato upon them. They have few friends to the east or the south, and those nations threatened by them will have a range of world powers weighed against them.As ISIS expands (if that happens), expect the permanent members of the UN Security Council to unite (a rare feat). Expect also Iran and the US to ally, and expect the Shia authorities of Iran to fight alongside the Taliban to defeat ISIS.ISIS won't get within a 1000 miles of India.
