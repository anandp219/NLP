 I continue to use the word migrants because in my view it seems to be both the most neutral and broadest term - including immigrants, emigrants, legal and illegal migrants, asylum seekers and refugees.Very often it's unclear precisely which category the latest migrants fall into, and it would be a mistake to label them refugees until they've been legally afforded that status. In many cases, while some of them might well be able to claims asylum, they choose not to do so, and assume for themselves the attitude of economic migrants, seeking to settle in Germany or the UK, for example, rather than in the first state they arrive in upon fleeing conflict or persecution.I understand that many people feel the term 'migrant' is pejorative. I believe this is because many people are unhappy with high levels of incoming migration. Relabeling - without clear justification - many migrants as refugees will do nothing to resolve people's concerns about migration and may threaten to undermine the plight of genuine refugees.----------Here's the BBC's editorial take on the question:The battle over the words used to describe migrants - BBC News
