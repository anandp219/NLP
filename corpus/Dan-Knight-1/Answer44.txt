 To accompany David Stewart's answer, a more recent update to Yes Minister is The Thick Of It.As a gritty, satirical comedy, The Thick Of It succeeded in not only being truly scathing and close to the bone, but also as a surprisingly accurate (The Thick Of It: When life imitates sweary art - BBC News) portrayal of British politics - "The truth is actually much more terrifying: we're making it up as we go along. Just like they are."Each episode is semi-improvised and, at points, unrehearsed. This makes the whole thing feel oh so real as situations unfold. You can see cast members squirm under the ruthless, foul mouthed heart and soul of the show: Malcolm Tucker - Peter Capaldi (AKA Dr. Who).The show was created by Armando Iannucci after arguing the case for Yes Minister as best British sitcom. A limited budget was granted and a short three episode series aired on BBC4 in 2005. Popularity grew quickly and the show flourished into 4 series, plus special episodes and a spin off film called In The Loop. The series has been the recipient of a number of awards, particularly from BAFTA. Series 1 won both "Best Situation Comedy" and Chris Langham won "Best Comedy Performance  male" at the 2006 BAFTA Television Awards, with Peter Capaldi being nominated for the same award in 2006 and 2008. Capaldi won the BAFTA at the 2010 awards, with Rebecca Front winning "Best Comedy Performance  female". The series was also declared the "Best Situation Comedy."The series also won Best Situation Comedy from the Royal Television Society in 2006 and 2010 and won Broadcasting Press Guild Awards in 2006 and 2010 for best sitcom and writing team.https://youtu.be/DaMb-5w-V0YThe definitive Malcolm Tucker (contains glorious swearing)
