 All music is subjective. I am listening to The Private Psychedelic Reel as I write this, it's certainly a good song, but why?As the name suggests, it pays homage to some of the psychedelic music produced in the 60's/70's and early 90's. The Chemical Brothers have always done well when collaborating with other artists and this song is no exception. Mercury Revs Jonathan Donahue was put to good use in adding an elaborate texture of guitar based, psychedelic, head-mashing madness to the latter half of the track. The repetitive sitar based loop adds structure to the encompassing lunacy, whilst the rhythm was reportedly provided by Jon Brookes (sadly deceased) from the band The Charlatans which and adds a juxtaposition to the straight up techno of prior tracks (RE: It Doesn't Matter). This gives the track a "band" atmosphere and aids the songs mission. Dig Your Own Hole offers a serotonin-tweaking rush common to all great rock 'n' roll, but wraps it in technological inventiveness that separates it from its big beat counterparts. The Private Psychedelic Reel is the perfect way to end a modern era psychedelic trip. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Of course, this isn't to everyone's taste. It's very full on. The noise can be quite abhorrent out of context. Skip to 8:45 and it's screaming at you. That's the other problem, at nearly ten minutes, it's not the kind of song you can easily listen to every day - It's a victim of it's own epicness. Few radio stations would play it and you couldn't mix with it in a club. It's a standout, standalone song that has its place in music history, just not in the mainstream.PS. It's certainly not trance.
