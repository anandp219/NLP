 I have to crticise the tieing in's with the horror film Alien: a violent portrayal of a face eating aliens directed by Ridley Scott in 1979.The association with a horrific film has no place with the sacarrine world of My Little Pony.There's a mention of Pitch Black - The violent rated 15 film based around the crash landing of the ship Hunter-Gratzner as it transports the violent criminal Riddick to jail.The whole of My Little Pony comic #6? seems to be pretty dark in nature, I certainly wouldn't want my son or daughter to read it if they were of a nervous disposition. This seems comepletely out of line with the My Little Pony ethos. Just take a look at this page: Twilights lack of knowlege has killed friendship! The sheer amount of peril in this one page would be quite daunting to those of a nervous disposition. The fear and terror in their eyes wouldn't be out of place in a Judge Dredd comic. The puns are weak, the peril is far too strong, the defeatest, pessimistic attitude of the some of the ponies is, at certain points, just too much to bear. It's far too departed from the My Little Pony I remember growing up as a child in the 80s and 90s.
