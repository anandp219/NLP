 This song has burdened the name Alice. I am aware this has already been answered, so it's not this version I'm talking about:Smokie - Who The Fuck Is Alicehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...No, the 'other' version is by brazen English comedian Roy Chubby Brown (interesting fact, his real name is Royston Vasey, the fictional location used in black comedy The League Of Gentlemen). This song has been ingrained into the British psyche. Everyone of a certain age knows the lyrics. For a bonus point, he also says "Alice Springs."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Roy chubby Brown - Who The Fuck Is Alice
