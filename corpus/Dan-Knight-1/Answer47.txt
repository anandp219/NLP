 Without any other details, I suspect it's the reflection of street lights. The nimbus clouds become engorged with water, which weighs them down lowers the altitude. Also, rain clouds are grey instead of white because of their density.It'll grow thicker and denser as it gathers more water droplets and ice crystals  the thicker it gets, the more light it scatters, resulting in less light penetrating all the way through it. Underneath, the particles don't have a lot of light to scatter to your eyes, so the base appears grey as you look on from the ground below. It's proximity to the ground coupled with it's colour will provide you red clouds.
