 One of my favourite French comedy films is Belleville Rendez-Vous (or to give it its official title The Triplets Of Belleville in everywhere else except the UK).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...The plot is quite simple: A grandmother discovers her grandsons fascination with bicycles from an early age, so she buys him one. Cut to years later, and he is now a contender for the Tour de France, with his grandmother still doting on him, now acting as his trainer. During the race itself he and other riders are kidnapped and taken to Belleville, so the grandmother and their enormously fat dog go looking for him. Without money or shelter, the two are discovered by three old women, former famous vaudevillians  The Triplets of Belleville. They invite her and the dog in to stay and help her attempt to rescue her grandson.All of the characters are hideous human caricatures - bodies are exaggerated to unrealistic proportions; this aids itself to the charm of the film. Its strictly in line with the original comic book by artist Sylvain Chomet and provides an original, antiquated visual style. Highly recommended.
