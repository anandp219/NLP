 I am an avid fan of Nicola Bertellotti, an Italian photographer who travels across Europe to capture the beautiful decay of crumbling ruins. Chambre Du CommerceHe's travelled from Poland to Belgium to Switzerland to his home country of Italy and everywhere in-between to photograph what he calls poetry marked by abandonment. Tomb Of The SithUnfortunately, he cant disclose the precise whereabouts of some of his shooting locations as there is a lot of competition between photographers. Some will purposely exaggerate the desolation of a scene to orchestrate more impact in a composition. Also, once a location is known, it can lead to further vandalism and graffiti. The Extreme Lonliness ExperimentTo find new locations, Nicola would scour the internet, look for ruined buildings on Google Maps, decipher vintage postcards on Ebay and receive information from a few trusted Human sources. Everything is kept a secret. Le Grand BleuMr Bertellotti's work is permanently on display in the Arte a Colori gallery in Colle di Val d'Elsa, Italy and can be viewed further here: http://www.nicolabertellotti.comSons Of NiobeFace OffAnnihilationThe Steampunk GreenhouseHistoricity Of Jesus
