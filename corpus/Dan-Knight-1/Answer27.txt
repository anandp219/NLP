 Recently I was lucky enough to go the UK national fireworks competition, it was pretty spectacular. In fact, it was the best firework displays Id seen. Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang, has taken the humble firework display a step further by using gunpowder as a medium to create innovative art. A few months ago, he realised a project 21 years in the making. To pay tribute to his grandmothers 100th birthday, he utilised a giant balloon to create a 1,650 ft pyrotechnic sky ladder.Cai Guo-Qiang was also responsible for the spectacular Beijing Olympic opening ceremony in 2008. This makes him one of the only artists to have over 1 billion people simultaneously view his artwork.He has staged many explosion events worldwide and operates as a public performance that conjures violent chaos, ritual celebration and awe.
