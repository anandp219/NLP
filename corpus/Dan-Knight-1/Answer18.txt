 There is an app made by the same game developer as The Dark Knight Rises, Modern Combat 5 and Asphalt 5: Airborne - Gameloft.The iOS and Android game maker has made a My Little Pony game, here is the description:"Saddle up for adventure with Twilight Sparkle & friends! After being locked away in the moon for centuries, Nightmare Moon is set free and spreading night across Ponyville! Only Twilight Sparkle and her friends can free Ponyville from her grasp and bring light and friendship back to the land. Help them rebuild the town and reach their dreams in exciting quests!" "Your favorite ponies are here: Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Applejack and more." "Make your Ponyville the most magical place in Equestria and explore Sweet Apple Acres and Canterlot" "Play fun mini-games with your ponies: Ball Bounce, Apple-Picking, Magic Wings, Telescope, Crystal Mine and Equestria Girls Dance game!"  "Interact with your friends and feel the Magic of Friendship" "Enjoy official TV show voice talents featured in the game!"On Android (my choice of OS) there has been 806,608 downloads, 574,754 of which have been 5 star reviews. You can't argue with the facts, a solid 4.3 out of 5 can't be argued with.
