 Dan Kitchener puts the "art" into "street art". I have to appreciate the sheer amount of effort he puts into his works. Dan spends a lot of his time working in freehand, which is even more impressive. I secretly like him that little bit more because he's from my part of the world. Born in 1974 in Essex, Dan is an urban artist - a painter, artist and illustrator living in Essex and working all over London and the South East. His work has a gritty urban theme, taken from everyday life and the surroundings and environment he experiences daily. He loves to find beauty in the most mundane of scenes and particularly loves the relationship with light, shadow and composition. Dan works using a variety of mediums - spray paint, paint markers, stencils and standard paint for the canvases.
