 I don't tend to watch adverts. I usually head back to Quora for an update for a couple of minutes. I do remember this Honda advert drew my attention every single time, which is what a good advert should do.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...It's very important that you understand: There are no computer graphics or digital tricks in this film. Everything you see really happened in real time exactly as you see it.The film took 606 takes. On the first 605 takes, something, usually very minor, didn't work. They would then have to set the whole thing up again.The crew spent weeks shooting night and day. The film cost six million dollars and took three months to complete including a full engineering of the sequence.There were six and only six hand-made Accords in the world. To the horror of Honda engineers, the filmmakers disassembled two of them to make the film.The sequence where the tyres roll up a slope looks particularly impressive, but is very simple. There is a weight in each tyre and when the tyre is knocked, the weight is displaced and in an attempt to rebalance itself, the tyre rolls up the slope.
