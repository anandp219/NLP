 Alexa Meade is an artist who uses Humans as her canvas. She turns them into living, breathing portraits. The effect is quite astonishing. The 28 year old made an impact on the art world when her works were featured on http://kottke.org/ (apparently one of the top influential blogs in the world). She quickly went viral because she has managed to create these reality distorting images despite having no formal training. She's recieved converage on CNN and various US national TV shows which came as a bit of of a shock. Speaking in 2008, she says "I started covering things in paint, from trees to blades of grass. I wanted to reference what was directly beneath the paint, and capture the shadows dripping on the landscape." From there she moved on to painting Human subjects, as you can see, this is where she had the most impact: Alexa is currently working on a couple of tech collaborations playing with augmented reality as well as virtual reality. She's creating some tessellating shape tiles as a design toy that helps build spatial intelligence.To view more of her photos, please have a look at her website: http://www.alexameade.com/
