 You're hanging out at home and your buddy is in the other room. You ask him to bring you a cup of water.He walks back into the room with one of the following:Nothing at all: this is the null array.An empty cup: this is the empty list case.A cup with water: this is the non-empty list case.Now, case 1 and 2 might feel the same to you (no water for you!), but logically, they are different. An empty cup is obviously not the same thing as no cup at all. They just aren't. One is a cup. One is not.The fact that he brought you an empty cup might signal something different than nothing at all. For example, it might signal that he heard you but you didn't have any water.Depending on what you wanted to do with the water, it might have a very different result. If you wanted to, say, add a drop of red food coloring to the water to make red water, in one case the drop lands on the table and makes a giant mess, and in the other case it lands in a cup.This is the difference between an empty list and no list at all. In some cases it might have the same implications, but in other cases it does not.
