 I have a very unique first name (and, for my first name, a fairly unique spelling). To some of the older Quorans, it might seem fairly mainstream. It's not -- at least not anymore.From Everyone has a name: In 2014, there were just 7 Gayle's born and only 13 Gail's. Interestingly, Abigail is extremely popular -- it's the 8th most common name. Still, people just don't like Gayle/Gail.Fine by me. I've really liked having an unusual name. I find that it helps my career in that I can more easily brand myself. It's not just that search engines can more easily find me and I can get the usernames I want, although that's definitely handy. It's also that "Gayle" is sufficiently descriptive to point to me. If you're in tech and you hear someone talking about someone named Gayle, it's very likely me (or likely enough that you might ask, if you knew me). This would not be true if my name were, say, Sarah.For this reason, I prefer to a more unique name (although with easier spellings) for my children. Unfortunately, it comes with the downside of less anonymity, if that's the path one choose. Ah, well.If you're really concerned with anonymity, you can look for names that are unique but still have an obvious nickname that's common. This way your child can choose to go by this nickname if he/she doesn't like having a unique name. For example:Wilson is fairly unique, but your child could go by Will.Johnson is unique, but your child could go by John.Jennette is unique, but your child could go by Jen.Aliana is unique, but your child could go by Ali.Names like this offer "brandability" as the default, but the option of anonymity.
