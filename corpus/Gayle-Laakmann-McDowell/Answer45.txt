 It depends on how core that built-in library is to the essence of the question. Generally, you shouldn't replace the essence of the interview question with a built-in library. So writing array.sort() when I ask you to sort an array would be defeating the point of the problem (which is to see how elegant your code is).But, if your solution merely relied on the array being sorted but it wasn't really the point of the question, then please do use the built-in library.That said, it's sort of an irrelevant question. If you're approaching questions the right way, then this doesn't really come up as an issue.First, you should be discussing the problem with your interviewer before you start coding. You shouldn't just code as soon as you think you have a solution to the problem. This would be the point to mention that there's a built-in library that handles the problem.Second, when you code, you should approach it top-down, not bottom-up. Start with the most high level function and then fill in the details as you go. This ensures that you get the most important algorithmic parts done first. If you do things this way, it won't really matter whether or not you can use the built-in library functions. Use them--and make up your own functions as you need. You can fill in the details as you have time.
