 As much as people are dismissing this question as obvious, it's actually more complicated -- or at least ambiguous.1. What do you want to mean by saying that you're, say, two months pregnant? I feel like that should reflect "I got pregnant two months ago." However, one could also count from the start of your last period, which is how the number of weeks counts.2. How many weeks are in a month? A lot of people say 4, but this isn't true. An average month has 4.35 weeks (365 days / 12 months per year / 7 days per week.With those two definitions agreed upon, this will compute the number of months: # months = (# weeks - 2) / 4.35.Therefore, 34 weeks is 7.36 months pregnant. A different set of assumption could also lead to different answers, such as:7.8 months (if pregnancy starts from the start of the last cycle and there are 4.35 weeks per month)8.5 months (if pregnancy starts from the start of the last cycle and there are 4 weeks per month)8 months (if pregnancy starts from conception and there are 4 weeks per month)Some people might even add a month to each of those, as they might not distinguish between "in the 8th month" and "8 months pregnant".Again, it's really a matter of definitions. The 7.36 answer corresponds most directly to how months since you got pregnant, which is logical to me. Some of the others lead to weird things, like saying you're 10 months pregnant on your due date.
