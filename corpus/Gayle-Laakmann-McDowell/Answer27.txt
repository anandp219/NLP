 If you actually performed poorly and your interviewer said that, he/she would be a jerk. It would be a bad sign, but mostly because you had an interview where you didn't do well and because you had an interviewer who was a jerk.But, honestly, I find it quite unlikely that your interviewer said this if you didn't do well. It's FAR more likely that in fact you only think you did poorly.See: Why Your Interview Performance is Impossible to Judge (More relevant for software engineering roles, but applicable regardless.)So, really, what you have is this question: Is it a good sign or a bad sign if your interviewer says "I hope the rest of your interviews go as well as this"? That indicates that you most likely did well and your interviewer really liked you. That's a great sign!
