 The way that Amazon works is that anyone can sell an item on there (not just the maker of the item). And, if it's your item that you physically own (or claim to own), then you can set whatever price you want.It's possible that someone owns a copy of the book and has decided to charge this amount for it. It is ludicrous? Of course. But that's their choice.More likely though, some computer algorithm has said, "Hey, this book is popular and hard to find -- I'll go charge X amount for it." The issue with computer algorithms is that the lack common sense. If you haven't specifically told them to account for some piece of information, then it won't just magically know to do it.In this case, what's happening is that the version of that book (the 4th edition) is no longer on sale, and it hasn't been on sale for nearly four years. The algorithm doesn't realize that it's not on sale because a newer, better version is. It doesn't realize that it should compare the price to that item and, if anything, be lower.The 5th edition is the latest edition and is a reasonable 530 rupees.
