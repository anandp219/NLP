 I've helped coach a number of teams through the Google acquisition process (as well as many other companies). It is quite common to require these interviews. It depends on whether it's a talent acquisition (acquihire) or a product/user acquisition. The closer it is to a talent acquisition the more likely that Google will interview the team as part of the "technical due diligence" process.This actually makes quite a bit of sense. If they're acquiring your company as a way to get engineers, doesn't it make sense that they'd want to assess the quality of those engineers in the same way they hire their own?Employees who underperform in these interviews are not brought on as part of the acquisition ("fired" as you might say, but it's not truly being fired). If too many people do poorly, the acquisition just won't happen at all.
