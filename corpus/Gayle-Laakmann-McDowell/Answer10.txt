 The short answer is yes.In any question of the sort "do I have to know __?", there's a trade off between:How often does it come up?How hard is it to derive it if you don't know it?How hard is it to learn it?How much of a perfectionist do you want to be?Tries are pretty easy to learn. If you understand trees, I could teach you the essentials of a trie in under two minutes.They also come up fairly frequently. The odds of you using a trie in your interview is under 50%, but it's not negligible at all.I think it's worth it to learn. You probably spent more time writing this question and reading my answer than it would take you to learn the basics of tries.
