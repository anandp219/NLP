 I don't know how many babies were negatively affected by it. The number is probably a lot higher than 17, but a lot lower than other countries (as it wasn't approved in the U.S.).The articles I've read have hedged a little on the number. They'll usually say that only 17 babies were shown to be impacted, which is different than saying only 17 babies were impacted.Note that health and other statistics are typically difficult to compare across countries, as the methodology for reporting and labeling is different. A country with mandatory reporting may have a much statistic, but that doesn't mean the true number is higher. Additionally, some countries might be much less likely to link an outcome with a specific cause, whereas others might be pretty comfortable in saying "mom took drug, baby is deformed, therefore, drug caused deformity."
