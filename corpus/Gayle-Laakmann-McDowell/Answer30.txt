 This will not pose an issue with Google or with the vast majority of tech companies in the U.S. In the U.S., the law is that a company cannot discriminate on the basis of physical disability if you would be able to perform the job with or without reasonable accommodation. (And the bar for "reasonable" goes pretty far.)I don't even see a reason to mention it to your recruiter. So you have to get up every 30 minutes? Most people get up and walk around periodically. No big deal.There's no accommodation they need to know of, so no reason to mention it.
