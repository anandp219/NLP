 Talk to him/her as much as possible. Don't use baby words unless you want him to learn baby words.Point out some simple objects: ball, mama, dada, etc.Listen carefully to what they say. They may be speaking in their own language. My son calls buses "ma" (no one knows why). It's not a real word, but it's his word. It counts! You don't need to use their makeup words with them, but you should respond as though they're saying the real thing.When they start being able to speak a bit, avoid yes/no questions ("Do you want to read a book?") and use either/or questions instead ("Do you want to play with the car or the spoon?"). This forces them to speak a little more while pushing their limits a bit.Push two word phrases. Teach them "more" and then "food." Once they have those, encourage them to put the two together to say "more food." Play dumb a bit, like you don't know what they want more of. As they develop their language skills, continue to push their abilities a bit and play dumb. Make them need to use their words to get the things they want.
