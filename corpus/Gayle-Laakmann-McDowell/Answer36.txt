 When I was in college, I TAd for a freshman/sophomore level computer science class. All the TAs were prior students in the class. We had by far the best set of TAs in the Computer Science department.Is that surprising? We surely had much less experience than the other TAs, who were usually PhD students. We didn't have the expertise in the subject area that the PhD students had.But here's the thing: We were great teachers. We were selected not because we were knowledgable in the material (although we had to of course do reasonably well in the class), but because we could effectively communicate it.They knew we could effectively communicate it because they'd just spent a year interacting with us and watching how we communicate. That's so much better than an interview.We'd just taken the class, so we knew what people struggled with. We could communicate it at their level because we were still at their level. We wouldn't try to explain things with concepts beyond their understanding.When a true subject-matter expert teaches something, he/she often communicates in a way that is too complex.You want your teachers to be great teachers, first and foremost. Experts absolutely have their role. You need an expert to set up the curriculum and to tackle some of the more difficult questions. But you don't need to be taught by experts at all times.I don't think it's that different at a coding bootcamp. You certainly want experts to be very involved. But prior students who really stood out in their communication skills could make excellent teachers. They can communicate the complex topics in a way that might just make more sense to a current student.
