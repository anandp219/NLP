 Yes. This is pretty standard practice -- not just for interviews, but for any sort of meeting. The meeting is only truly scheduled when both parties agree to that specific time. When you give a range of times that you're available, they cannot reasonably expect you to keep the entire range open. By the time they respond, some of your availability might have changed. Therefore, they need you to reconfirm that this time works.We do the same thing socially:Alex: "Hey, want to grab dinner sometime next week? I'm free Monday, Tuesday and Thursday." Alex has no particular obligation to keep those nights open, but it's nice if Alex can.Pat: "Sure, Monday works."Pat is expected to hold Monday for dinner with Alex -- for a short period of time, until Alex confirms (or not).Alex: "Great, see you then!"Both Pat and Alex are expected to hold Monday for dinner.The event is only really scheduled once Alex has also confirmed. Before then, Pat is somewhat in limbo.Additionally, if Pat specifically asks for a confirmation ("Sure, is Monday good?") then it's definitely expected that Alex would need to confirm. This isn't redundant. It typically doesn't change the situation (since hopefully you are still free at that time), but it does often enough that it serves an important function.
