 In general terms, estoppel is a common law doctrine that precludes somebody - who is said to be "estopped" - from denying a legal truth, in the course of a legal action.The truth can be words or conduct, and express or implied.There are many categories of estoppel, but to say much more is to get into issues that vary according to jurisdiction.A simple example that would be applicable to most common law jurisdictions (by different names) is a reliance-based estoppel, which generally has the elements that one party is induced to believe that a certain state of affairs exists, and relies on that to their detriment. The other party is then estopped from denying that the state of affairs exists.For example, imagine that the terms of a lease of a building have been agreed - price, duration, and other essential terms - but the contractual formalities have not yet been finalised. The landlord says "feel free to do a fit-out and move in while the lease is being drawn up". Despite a requirement (in many jurisdictions) that a lease has to be evidenced in writing to be binding, the landlord would be estopped from later denying that a lease agreement existed, on the basis that they had led the other party to believe that the agreement was finalised, and that a written lease was forthcoming. In reliance on that belief (created by the landlord), the other party had expended money improving the premises and moving in (detriment).
