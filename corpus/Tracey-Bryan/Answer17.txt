 None of the examples provided in the question details seems to qualify as an "honour killing", but murders motivated by individual circumstances. (Which doesn't make them less abhorrent, it just makes them murders rather than honour killings.)Therefore the answer to the question, as far as I can tell, is that the phenomenon of honour killing is relatively extremely rare outside cultures that are heavily influenced by Islam.Having said that, there are many Islamic cultures in which honour killings are completely unacceptable, so I don't think it's either helpful or relevant to emphasise the religion of the perpetrators. We need, instead, to be doing everything we can to fix backward cultural norms that ever consider it acceptable to murder in the name of "honour". Such norms have no place in an ethical society.
