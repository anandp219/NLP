 The realisation that everybody - including me! - is somebody's ideal partner and hottest fantasy. It's always worthwhile improving oneself - per Marcus' excellent answer - but I don't have to change myself, and be somebody other than I am, to be loved.I don't have to feign an interest in things that don't interest me, and downplay my "embarrassing" interests. I don't have to lose or gain weight, wear more or less makeup, be more socially adept, take up rock-climbing, dance better, wear different clothes, or do anything else that doesn't genuinely serve me in order to be worthy of somebody else's love.We are all worthy of love, just as we are. And just as we are, we are somebody else's ideal.If we pretend to be somebody else who we think is more desirable, then we'll attract somebody who likes the person we're pretending to be. Then we have to stick with that pretence, in order to maintain that relationship.It's much easier, and more rewarding, just to be who you are, and find the person who loves you, just as you are.[The other half of the equation, of course, is whether the other person deserves to be loved back, but fortunately for me, I seemed to intuitively make good decisions in this regard, though I know that many don't. That's the only reason I only focus on this half.]
