 A young man has been dating a young woman he really likes for a few months, and she invites him to meet her parents. They go to her parents' home for dinner, and he is introduced to the family pet Rover, an old Labrador.Everything is going well and he's enjoying the meal, when all of a sudden, the guy is overcome with a need to fart. Oh gosh, what is he going to do? He's trying to impress her parents!He suppresses it for a while, but the pressure is growing. Eventually, he decides he has to relieve it a bit, and ever so carefully, he releases just a little bit of gas.About 15 seconds later, his girlfriend's father pauses mid-sentence to bark "Rover!" at the dog, and continues speaking. Rover is lying in the corner of the room, between the boyfriend and the father, and fortunately, it seems that the father thinks that it's Rover who's farting.A few minutes later, the boyfriend risks releasing a little bit more.Another 15 seconds or so after that, as the odour spreads, the father again hollers: "Rover!"Conversation continues, and the boyfriend is mightily relieved that he seems to have gotten away with releasing some of the pressure in his bowels, without embarrassing himself in front of his girlfriend's parents.Eventually he risks releasing all of the remaining pressure, as quietly as he can.A few seconds later, the father roars: "For God's sake, Rover, move out of the way before this boy shits all over you!"
