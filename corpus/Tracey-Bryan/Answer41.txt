 I've found the Quoracast, and having skype sessions with Quora employees due to my former role as an admin, a fascinating experiment, and have discovered that one forms an idea of what people's voices sound like, and that it rarely matches the reality.Marc Bodnick, Michelle Roses, Marcus Geduld, David Urquhart, and Jonathan Brill, all sounded very different than I'd expected. None of them sounded better or worse, just different. I'm sure this phenomenon has been studied, but my amateur take is that we create a "voice" for each personality as one of many ways of distinguishing individual personalities, and organising them in our memories. (I have no idea why we create one voice as opposed to another, though.)It's quite a jarring experience, at first, and my initial reaction was: "oh my gosh, I really don't know that person that I thought I knew", or "I don't know this person!", but that's just a response to the conflict between your presumed voice and their actual voice. :) What I have found, though, is that by listening for a while, my "mental model" of a person rapidly adjusts to incorporate the actual voice, and I no longer experience that dissonance. In fact, as time passes, it's increasingly difficult to recreate the voice that I thought they had; it's being substituted in my memory by their actual voice.Interestingly, Christine Leigh Langtree is perhaps the only Quoran that I can think of, who sounds almost exactly as I'd imagined. :) I do wonder if the fact that we're both Queenslanders is relevant. i.e. If your imagination makes a closer "guess" for people with accents that you're more familiar with. (Though I still had David wrong, and he's Aussie, too.)
