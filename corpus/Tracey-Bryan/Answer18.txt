 I think it is preferable to clarify the interpretation intended by the original asker, and then re-word the question to be unambiguous, prior to answering.If it can be interpreted in two ways, A and B, it is less helpful to have answers on the page that are a mix of answers to question A and answers to question B. It is much more helpful to figure out whether the OP intended A or B, then make it clear in the question wording, and if they meant A, and somebody wants to answer B, then they can post another question.That's the only way that you can end up with the optimal outcome: one page for question A, with answers to question A, and one page for question B, with answers to question B.Doing it the other way is likely to result in an unsatisfactory mess of "question A/B" with some answers relating to A and some answers relating to B, plus a page for "clear A" and a page for "clear B", and no way for the pages to be merged to sort out the mess.The only way to address this situation consistent with Quora's core mission - make the page more helpful for people who want answers to the question - is to clarify before answering.[One notable point: ideally, Quora would have the ability not only to merge questions, but also to separate them, and then "sort" the answers onto the split pages A and B. Site admins - back when they existed - asked for this feature repeatedly, but it wasn't a high priority. Hopefully one day it will be, as this situation is far from uncommon.]
