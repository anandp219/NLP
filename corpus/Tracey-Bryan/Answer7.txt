 People who would be defined as libertarians or conservatives, by US standards, are virtually non-existent in Australia. I can honestly say that I don't know a single one. I don't think I can even recall seeing any libertarians in the media, though some people like politician Cory Bernardi may go close to being identified as a conservative. (Though even he is significantly left of many US-style conservatives, e.g. supporting universal healthcare.) And note that he's considered an extremist in Australia.As David Stewart correctly identifies, people who home school in Australia are far more likely to be from the opposite end of the political spectrum, and home school because they want to "unschool" or employ some other more flexible educational experience.
