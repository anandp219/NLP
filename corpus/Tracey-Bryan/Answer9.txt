 There was relatively little resistance. Even those who were initially opposed to the laws largely saw it as an inconvenience that they were experiencing for the greater good. Australia places a very high cultural value on "mateship", which could be described as "treating your fellow citizens as friends ("mates") unless you have some reason not to, and doing the right thing by your friends, even if it's detrimental to yourself". The gun buyback was sold to the public as something that was painful, but necessary, and consistent with the value we place on mateship.The largest resistance was from farmers, though even they grudgingly accepted that it was necessary. In time, even they have admitted that:they benefitted from the new laws (due to significant reduction in suicides amongst farmers), it really didn't negatively affect their farming operations as much as anticipated, and it significantly benefitted their mates, outweighing any cost to them.Even amongst those organisations that were insistent that the sky would fall in, these laws are now entrenched in our culture, and you virtually never hear any complaints. Even a whisper of loosening the laws, however, is met with widespread and vehement condemnation; it's politically a non-starter.We view the situation in the United States as absolute vindication that we've done the right thing. There is far more complaint from American gun advocates about what we've done, than there is from Australians. Even Australian sporting shooters and farmers are largely on-side with our laws. There simply is no significant dissent or objection. We love our safe environment, and we're not going to be told by American gun advocates that we're oppressed or wrong, just because we don't sacrifice over 300 lives a day on the altar of a principle. We choose, happily, not to do that.
