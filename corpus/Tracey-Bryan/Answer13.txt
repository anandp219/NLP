 I am a long-time fan of Malcolm Turnbull, and have often said he's perhaps the only person on the right side of politics who just might get my vote. So I'm ecstatic at the thought of having him as a PM rather than Tony Abbott.I am concerned to hear that Malcolm Turnbull has undertaken to honour the party's positions on the environment and marriage equality, which he is opposed to. I wonder how long this undertaking is for? If just until an election - which he might call soon - then I can live with it. :)Whilst I'm traditionally more of a leftie, I think Turnbull's rise is bad news for the ALP. I think anybody looks better than Tony Abbott. I'm not sure Bill Shorten will stack up as well compared to Malcolm Turnbull. Though that may cause other ALP stars to emerge - I'd love to see Tanya Plibersek take on Malcolm Turnbull at the next election. That'd be a real contest!
