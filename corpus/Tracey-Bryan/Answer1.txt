 The majority of non-European migrants are from SE Asia, particularly China, India, and Vietnam. Very few immigrants from these countries arrived between 1901 and around 1975, when Australia had the (now-embarrassing) White Australia Policy, making immigration very difficult for non-English-speaking people.The Chinese have a long history in Australia, beginning with the 1850s gold rush, and a significant population was in place prior to the enactment of the dreaded White Australia policy. After the policy was lifted, many Chinese came to Australia to flee political persecution, to study, or simply to pursue a better life.There was a small population of Indians in Australia prior to the White Australia policy being enacted, but since its lifting, there has been a large immigration, primarily amongst professionals seeking employment opportunities.The majority of Vietnamese came as refugees in the late '70s and early '80s, and are well-known for being hard workers who frequently establish and operate thriving small businesses.
