 I agree with the advice given elsewhere that you should just add which topics are appropriate, but to elaborate: additional topics add to distribution,but I don't believe they can reduce. A good rule of thumb is to add the specific topic, and perhaps a topic that goes up on level of abstraction.So if your topic is specifically about growing Granny Smith apples, you would add Granny Smith (apple), and it would also be reasonable to add Apples (fruit), but it would probably be going too far to also add Fruit.My understanding is that a question with both Apples (fruit) and Granny Smith (apple) has the same or more distribution than a question that only has Apples (fruit), not less, if that's your question.
