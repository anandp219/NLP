 I have very positive feelings towards India. Ironically, I find the Indian government's actions in seeking to censor this documentary reflect far more negatively on India than this documentary did (which I have seen).By attempting to ban this documentary, the government is suggesting that:"Reputation" and "honour" are tangible things that it's acceptable to defendThe actions of third parties can damage reputation and honourDefending reputation and honour thus demand that such actions by third parties be prohibitedIsn't this precisely the thinking that the vast majority of people - including the vast majority of Indians, I presume - are fighting? Isn't this precisely the logic underlying honour killings, and the "she deserved it for being out at night with an unrelated male" responses to rape?India is a thriving, robust, liberal democracy. It can withstand close scrutiny, and to be defensive and try to shut down conversation and examination is highly unbecoming. It is action more suited to a dictatorial regime than the liberal democracy that is modern India.I felt the documentary actually presented India, overall, very positively. Despicable crimes such as this one also happen in western countries, and documentaries are made about those, too. We don't watch such documentaries and assume this is an indictment of the whole society or country; we look at such incidents as an opportunity to examine where the "weak spots" are in our society, and try to figure out ways how to strengthen them. Just as India is, and should be, doing.
