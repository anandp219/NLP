 Consistent with core Quora philosophies, users should upvote answers that answer the question well and are likely to be helpful to people who want answers to that question.If you disagree with an opinion, that's not really relevant unless it impacts on the helpfulness of the answer.So, for example, if the question is: "Is X to blame for Y?"An answer that says "Yes, X is to blame because of reasons A, B, and C", and this forms a coherent argument, then you should upvote, even if you don't think X is to blame, because the answer is likely to be helpful to the asker of the question in understanding the various viewpoints that are held on the issue.An answer that you disagree with that simply says: "Yes, X is to blame because she's an incompetent fool who should have been thrown out of office years ago", then you should downvote, because it's not a helpful contribution to understanding the issue.Conversely, an answer that you agree with that simply says: "No, of course X isn't to blame, this is all just a smokescreen to try to prevent people noticing the incompetence of Z", isn't helpful unless it elaborates on why this theory - that it's a smokescreen - is a valid one.
