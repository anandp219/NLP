 Primarily, it's helpful against corrosion. It's also lower maintenance; polishing needs to be done several times a year to keep looking good, whereas paint stays looking good for longer (dirt "washes off"). The reduced expense from this lower maintenance outweighs the cost incurred by the additional weight.US WWII military aircraft stopped being painted in late 1943 because the speed gain of lower weight was judged more important than the camouflage benefits of a paint scheme. So the B-29 changed its appearance from this:To this:Corrosion doesn't appear to have been a big consideration, which is logical: the planning timeframes when you're a military force fighting a war are much shorter than those for a commercial airline with life cycle cost concerns. The military (at least during wartime) are less concerned with how the aircraft will be corroding in a decade, than how fast they can get it off the production line and into action, and then how fast it will fly, right now. There's also the reality that many wartime aircraft, at least in a WWII context, are unlikely to survive for long enough for corrosion to be an issue.Sources:Painting versus Polishing of Airplane Exterior SurfacesThe U.S. Army Air Forces Strips Its Planes of Paint | Defense Media Network
