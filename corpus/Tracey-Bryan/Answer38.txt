 Operation Mikado is not analogous to killing a downed pilot on the ground, because Operation Mikado was an attack designed to reduce the capacity of the Argentinians to engaged in air battle, i.e. had a valid military objective. A downed pilot has no plane with which to engage in air combat, and the targeting of such a pilot is not a legitimate military objective.A pilot descending in a parachute is already hors de combat (taken out of the battle). Military personnel are only ever able, under the laws of armed conflict, to use the minimum force necessary to render an enemy combatant hors de combat, so the application of any force against a pilot descending in a parachute would be unlawful. (Precluding some exceptional circumstance such as the pilot using a weapon and attempting to engage the enemy during descent.)You're right that there's no guarantee the pilot will surrender upon landing; the pilot must be given that opportunity, but is "fair game" if any hostile act is attempted. Protocol 1 to the Geneva Convention, Article 42, section 2 states: Upon reaching the ground in territory controlled by an adverse Party, a person who has parachuted from an aircraft in distress shall be given an opportunity to surrender before being made the object of attack, unless it is apparent that he is engaging in a hostile act.
