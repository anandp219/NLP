 The Shrine of Bah'u'llh is for Bah's the most holy spot, and our qiblih, towards which we orient when we pray.It is located near Acre in Israel, amidst the magnificent gardens of Bahj, where Bah'u'llh lived his final years. His remains are interred in the small, square brown brick building that is closest to the camera in the image below. Behind and slightly to the left, the double-storey white building is the Mansion of Bahj, where his family lived with him. Pilgrims visiting the shrine process up the walkway marked by the rows of red vegetation at the left.More: Shrine of Bah'u'llh
