 The safety level of a martial art depends on how you practice it. Of course there are hard and soft styles, but none of the modern arts should break your body. I practice Judo, too, and I don't have problems with my body. Nowadays, competitive judokas train in a way which is not ideal. The idea of Judo is to be safe. A remarkable matter in conducting Judo throws is to pay attention to your stance: if your back is crooked and knees to wrong directions, you are causing harm to your body. A good technique is pleasant both to tori and uke. Considering safety, Aikido (particularly Aikikai styles) is a safe art. It does not contain combat and the techniques are not conducted in order to cause harm. Considering the practical side, if this means self defense, Aikido is not a quick way to it. For a practical and multifaceted art I suggest Combat Hapido. It is a hybrid of many other arts and its only focus is on self-defense. It is also classified as a soft art, so it would be both safe and practical.
