 'Tone' is the change in the pitch, which affects the meaning (lexically or in some other way). Tones can be level tones, i.d. they don't change in time, or contour tones, i.d. they pitch makes a figure, for instance rising, falling, falling-rising and so on.'Accent' is perhaps a bit ambiguous. The strict meaning is 'stress' or 'prominence'. Accented syllables are made clearly distinct from the other syllables by putting more effort on them, uttering them more loudly or using a higher pitch. Accented syllables are not necessarily stressed; there are languages that don't use stress but still make some of their syllables prominent, which means accented. On the other hand, I have seen in a linguistic work the term 'accent' in the meaning it is usually used in everyday English, that is 'distinct pronunciation', meaning that the speech in question does not have other dialectical differences than pronunciation.'Pitch' means how high the sound is. Pitch is a perceptual and subjective impression. If we look at the physical side, we speak of 'frequency'. Frequency means how many Hz the sound has, whereas pitch tells how the listener perceives it. I'm not sure whether 'volume' is used as a linguistic term. The physical side of the volume of a sound is called 'amplitude'. It is measured in dB. The perceptual side of this is 'loudness', it tells the impression that the listener gets from the amplitude of the sound in question.
