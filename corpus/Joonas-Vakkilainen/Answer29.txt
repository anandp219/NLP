 Those languages listed contain two language families and three sub-groups. Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian belong to the Uralic family. Latvian and Lithuanian belong to the Indo-European family. Within the Uralic family, Finnish and Estonian are members of the Finnic group, whereas Hungarian is a member of the Ugric group. Latvian and Lithuanian are both in the Baltic group.Latvian and Lithuanian are, as said, in the same sub-group of the same family. However, they are clearly different languages. The fact that Lithuanian is often said to be the closest modern language to the Proto-Indo-European whereas Latvian is not tells that they are not mutually intelligible. Latvian also has a lot of Finnic influence.Finnish and Estonian are close relatives but not fully mutually intelligible. They began diverging from the same proto-language approximately 2000 years ago, so they have had time to develop differences. Finnish and Estonian have many phonological, grammatical and lexical differences. Sometimes you can guess the meaning but many times you guess wrong. Finnish and Karelian are closer so they are in many aspects mutually intelligible. Proto-Ugric, the ancestor of Hungarian, began diverging from Proto-Finno-Ugric something like 5000 year ago, so it is clear that Hungarian is a distant relative of Finnish and Estonian.
