 Louie Popp gave a detailed answer about those languages but the indigenous languages are missing: the Saami languages. The Saami languages spoken in the area of Scandinavia are Pite, Lule, Ume, Southern and Northern Saami. Finnish spoken in Scandinavia can be divided into three parts. Strictly speaking, Finnish refers only to the Finnish-Swedish citizens and newer Finnish immigrants. Those are called svergefinnar in Swedish. Finnic people living in the region along the Torne River speak Torne Valley Finnish, which is also called with their own name Menkieli. It could be just a dialect of Finnish, but Swedish government has granted it a minority language status as an independent language. Furthermore, Menkieli-speaking people are not called sverigefinnar because they are not immigrants or their descendants. There is a similar kind of situation northern Norway as well. The form of Finnish spoken in the county of Finnmark is classified as an independent minority language with the name Kven.Historically, Vrmland in Sweden had its own Finnish dialect called Vrmland Savonian. It was based on the language of eastern Finnish immigrants a few hundred years ago. It is not spoken any longer.
