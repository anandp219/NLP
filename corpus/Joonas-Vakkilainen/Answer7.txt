 Finnish universities don't have tuition fees for anyone. There is now a political debate going on about the tuition fees for students who are not citizens of EEA countries. Foreign students, however, don't usually get student allowance. I need to correct a bit Lyonel Perabo's answer. If you go to Finland to study, you need first a study place. When you have it, you can apply for a residence permit. As far as I know, you don't need to know Finnish or Swedish for that if you are not studying a degree that requires one of the national languages. There is a good info site available in many languages. I think you'll get answers for everything from there: Coming to study in FinlandAbout the other things: The weather in Finland is varying. It is possible that the Midsummer Day (juhannus) has the same temperature as the Christmas Day. Winters are not necessarily as cold and snowy as they are in post cards. In southern Finland it is possible that you won't see snow at all. Some summers are hot and dry, some summers are rainy and less warm. Nordic people in general belong to the culture of negative politeness. That is, people don't address other people if they don't need to. In positive politeness, you have to tell people compliments but in negative politeness, you avoid saying unnecessary things to people who are not in your inner circle. People don't want to intervene in others' businesses. Non-Nordic people may find this rude, but we don't see it in that way. There are cultural places where people behave differently. Sauna has a relaxed atmosphere, which is a good place for foreigners to make contact with Finns if they can't do it elsewhere. Though, I don't think that foreign students have much problems with getting to know people, because many Finnish students probably want to make friends with them.
