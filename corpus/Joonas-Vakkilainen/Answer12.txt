 This happens in Finnish, too, but in a very restricted occasion. Singular past participle ends with -nut or -nyt, and in colloquial speech, the final t is not pronounced. However, it doesn't disappear wholly because it assimilates with the following consonant. This results in geminate consonants between the participle and the following word. If the following word begins with a vowel, the final t is represented as a geminate glottal stop.tullut juna [tul:uj:un] ('the train that has come')tullut mies [tul:um:ies] ('the man that has come')tullut pappi [tul:up:p:i] ('the priest that has come')tullut auto [tul:u:uto] ('the car that has come')This also happens with the word nyt ('now') but I can't think of any other words. Other t's are not assimilated with glottal stop, even though they would with some other consonants, at least in my dialect. In standard Finnish, t's are always pronounced as [t]. There are other word types, too, where a lost final consonants assimilates with the following phoneme, creating a long glottal stop before vowels. vene rannalla [ener:n:l:] ('boat on the shore')vene saapui [enes::pui] ('boat arrived')venekin [enek:in] ('boat, too')vene oli [ene:oli] ('boat was')This phonological feature is called boundary gemination (rajageminaatio in Finnish), traditionally also end gemination (loppukahdennus) in Finnish grammar. The place of the historical lost consonant at the end of the word causing this phenomenon is called jnnslopuke which literally means 'residual ending'.
