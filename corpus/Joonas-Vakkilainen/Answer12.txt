 Based on the question, you are a native English-speaker. English phontactics doesn't allow syllable-initial [ts]. Thus, let's look at the problem from the English point of view./ts/ is pronounced by placing the tongue on the /t/ place and then releasing the airflow with the /s/ manner. Although this specific cluster or affricate is not possible in English, English does have a similar kind of affricate in word like church and cheese. The method of the ch // sound is similar as the one of the ts sound but it happens in a different place. In this sound, the tongue is placed on the /j/ place (as in yes). So, you are first placing your tongue as if you were going to say a palatalised t /t/ as in tube (British English) and then you just release the airflow with the sh // manner. When you realise how you produce the ch sound, you can just move the ch placement to the front. That's how you'll get the ts sound. Knowing how to make it yourself, you can pay attention to it in perceiving native Japanese-speakers' speech.
