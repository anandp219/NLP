 Others have mentioned uchikomi already, but there are other kinds of methods, too. A judoka must know the very basics in order to be able to throw an opponent successfully. One important thing is stance. Jigohontai is a method to observe your stance, the distribution and direction of weight on your knees and the position of your back. Another essential matter is taisabaki. When you throw, you need to get to the right point so that you are in a good balance all the time. Do basic taisabakis alone. You can also practice the movements of kuzushi just by yourself. Then add some throws to them as tandokurensh ('alone practice'). If you can't do a technique without uke, you can't do it with uke.
