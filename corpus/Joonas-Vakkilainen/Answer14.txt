 To put it briefly, children brain has different "settings" from adults. Acquiring a native language requires a sensitive period which happens in early childhood. An infant is able to learn every possible sound used in human language but after the certain period, the sound system gets locked. Everyone learning a foreign language notices how difficult it is to hear or produce particularly the vowel system of a new language. That's just the difference between a child and an adult, and that's how humar brain works. Children who have been raised by animals with no human contact do not acquire a native language because they have lost the sensitive period (if they are not adopted early enough to a human community). On the other hand, adults who want to learn a foreign language should not take a child as their model of learning. That's because, despite the advances of early childhood in language acquiring, children need a long time to become fluent in their language. They need a lot of input from adults as well as they make a lot of mistakes for a long time. Adults are able to learn a language much faster than children. They just need to do it in a different manner.
