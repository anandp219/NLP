 I have seen it used in the description of the grade alternation in Sami languages that have three step quantity alternation. I have only a very basic understanding of the Northern Sami morphophonology, but the vowel quantity seems to be linked to the grade of the stem accompanied with a consonant change. The short vowel mark is used to indicate short diphthongs in Northern Sami. As I see it, the vowel quantity indicates the difference between the second and third grade regardless of the actual quantity of the altered consonant: for instance, when the strong grade contains an overlong consonant, the vowel is short, and when the consonant shortens to a second-grade long consonant in the weak grade, the vowel lengthens (bus'sa [puss:] : bussa [pu:s:] ('cat')). This seems like a compensatory change. However, the vowel quantity works similarly in cases where the consonant lengthens in the weak grade (biila [pijl] : biilla [pi:jl:] ('car')). The terms strong and weak grade do not refer to the actual quantity grades of the consonants (as they do in Finnic languages). The weak form can have a "stronger" consonant than the strong form. (Examples of the grade patterns in Northern Sami)Where the short vowel mark steps in, are the diphthongs:boadnji : boatnji ('husband', nom. and gen.)[pdnji] [potnji] [for some reason the mark won't hit ]vieat : viean ('to bring' : 'I bring')[vdht] [vietn]guova : guova ('bear', nom. and gen.)[kv] [kuovd]There may also be, depending on the dialect, quality changes in diphthongs: [o] can be [u], when [] remains [o], and [e] can become [i], whereas [] is represented as [e]. (Younger speakers may not make the voice distinction in the middle consonants either.)Another case where the short mark is used is the description of the Estonian three-step quantity system. In the case of consonants, the second grade is described to be a short consonant + an extra-short consonant:lugu [luku] ('story')luku [lukku] ('lock', part.) [again, the mark won't hit the target]lukku [luk:u] ('to the story', 'to the lock')
