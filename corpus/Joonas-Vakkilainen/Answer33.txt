 Yes, the interest for the Chinese language has increased. I can only speak for my own country, Finland, where Chinese has been taken account in education. At a certain grade of elementary school, pupils have to choose a language. Many choose English at this point, but most schools have choices. My school offered English and German, for instance. Nowadays, some schools offer Chinese to be chosen in elementary school. This means that the pupils who choose it will have Chinese classes almost through their whole school life. Another example is that degree programs for Chinese teachers has been started at University of Helsinki. They have already had the Chinese language degree program, but now students of Chinese language can specialise on becoming teachers. The same is now possible for Japanese as well. In the future, there will be educated Finnish-born Chinese language teachers in our schools.
