 One reason is that those names follow the old orthography. Old Spanish used x to mark the Spanish the h sound. For example, Texas would be Tejas in modern orthography. Historically, the Spanish h sound was the sh sound. In Mexico, Nahuatl words with the sh sound were written with x, for example, xochitl ('flower') is pronounced approximately shochitl. After the sound change in Spanish, Mexican place names of Nahuatl and other indigenous origin underwent the same change because they were now Spanish words. The spelling remained the same.
