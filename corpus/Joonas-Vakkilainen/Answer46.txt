 This is one of the most typical misunderstandings about language. Most people, who have the accent of the region they live in, seldom think of their own accent. That's because they hear the same accent all the time. The majority of the locals speak in the same accent so they don't pay attention to it. When they meet a person who has moved from another region, they immediately notice it because it is something that doesn't follow their norm. If the accent is also used in the national media, it really appears to be a norm. To the speakers of the "norm" accent, this creates an illusion of their accentlessness. To the speakers of "non-norm" accents, the accent used in media may sound either annoying ("that's the accent of those capital city jerks") or something desirable ("that's how successful and cool people speak"). Because of that, the speakers of non-media accents probably don't think they don't have an accent themselves. They may still consider their personal accents milder than they in reality are. This is not just an American thing. This happens very easily to all people living in the home region of their own accent regardless of the country, in my country and region, too. Someone once talked to me about person who had moved from another region. She said that when the person goes to his home region, he speaks in his dialect, although he speaks in a "normal, accentless" way in our region.
