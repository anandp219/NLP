 Latin means the language that originated from the Italic form of language in the province of Latium in antiquity. It was the language of the Romans. They called it lingua Latina ('the Latin langauge') or sermo Latinus ('the Latin speech'). Often, when we say Latin we mean the stylised upper-class register of particularly written Latin that was called Latinitas by the Romans. The Latin used by the Catholic church is an ossified form of Latin used by the Roman folk and later after the antiquity. It is grammatically and lexically Latin but it is pronounced in Italian.
