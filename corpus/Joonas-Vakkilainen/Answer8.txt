 It is important to note that budo arts are not primarily self defense, and that self defense is not the same as martial arts. Budo is a modernised way to practice combat techniques safely, without a combat, in a world where we don't constantly have to spend time in a battlefield. The old bujutsu () meant the combat methods to harm permanently or to kill an opponent as fast as possible. Bujutsu was developed into bud (), where the aim was not to train warriors but enhance people both physically and mentally. The philosophy turned around: in bujutsu, mental training was a helping method for the combat, whereas in budo, the physical techniques are a helping method for the mental development. When speaking of aikido, we must observe it in the latter sense. Aikido is not meant to be a way to fight in a combat. The name  aikid can be translated as 'the way of meeting with ki'. For some people ki is a mystical, spiritual thing, but from a physical point of view, it means actually the way how you place yourself in relation to your opponent and how you maintain your stance. Many Japanese aikido senseis don't even teach technique almost at all, they just teach aiki, "meeting with the ki" (you are free to see that spiritually or physically (I do the latter one)). In aikido, the practitioners are not in a combat with each other; they are helping each other to observe those aiki things. Both the attacker and the target of the attack have their own important roles in that process. On the other hand, the effectiveness of self defense is more about the way how it is realised than about the art itself. Aikido has basically the same techniques as every martial art. Combat hapkido, which is a self defense and real life focused modern martial art, uses many same techniques as aikido but it uses them in a self defense way. If you practice aikido long enough with the focus on self defense, it is possible that you will learn effective self defense. Though, in that case it may not be aikido any longer that you are practicing. My aikido sensei says that as a self defense, aikido is a long path and you should not choose it if you want to learn effective self defense fast. Fighting just is not the goal of aikido. It is a formalised method of practicing the coordination of body and mind.
