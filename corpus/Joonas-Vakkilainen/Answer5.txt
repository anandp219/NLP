 Dialectology is a linguistic discipline that classifies, describes and documents dialects. It observes regional variation of language. Dialectologists record people's speech and find there features that make their form of language an independent dialect. They search the geological distribution of lexical, phonological, morphological and other grammatical features drawing a map of isoglosses. According to the distribution of the features, dialects can be grouped into big and small groups of dialects. Traditional dialectology concentrates on static language. Dialects are seen as stable form of language that can be described with the terms of grammar and lexicon. For instance, Finnish dialectologists (Finnish dialects belong to the most researched dialects in the world, by the way) in the 20th century did their fieldwork by interviewing old people who had lived their all life in the same village without getting a good education. The interviewees were supposed to live specifically in rural areas. Those criteria made sure that the dialect was "pure" and free of intervening influence from other regions or language change. This is why dialectology is not interested in urban language or social factors. Modern sociolinguistics researches the things dialectology is not interested in. It is interested in differences in language that are caused by social factors, which can be regional but related to social classes, gender and rural vs. urban as well. Unlike traditional dialectology, sociolinguistics wants to look into the variation with the same dialect and the same speaker and not to see language as a stable system. Therefore, dialectology is as a strictly limited branch of sociolinguistics, though sociolinguistics is a younger discipline. Dialectology observes only regional variation, whereas sociolinguistics observes every kind of linguistic variation.
