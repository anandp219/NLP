 The other answers already point out, the premise of the question is false. In addition to that, I'd like to focus on the weird question details: Turkey is not Uralic. Turkish is a Turkic language. There is an old hypothesis of the Ural-Altaic language family, which would include both Uralic and Turkic languages, but according to the available evidence, they are distinct families. Nevertheless, Most Uralic-speakers are Christians. Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian and many minority languages in Russia are Uralic and the majority of their speakers are Christian. Sami is a Uralic subgroup as well. I have no idea why it is connected to North Africa in the question details [EDIT: concerning the original details]. Sami people are the only indigenous nation in the European Union, and today most of them are Christians. They are living in the area of northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland as well as Kola Peninsula in Russia.
