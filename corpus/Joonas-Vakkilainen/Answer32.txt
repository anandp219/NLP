 My birthplace and current place of residence is Tampere in Finland. Before the ancestors of the Finnish people came in, the place was inhabited by the ancient Samis. Their legacy can be found in some place names.Ancient Finns consisted of different tribes, whose locations became historical provinces. My region was the province of the Tavastians (hmliset), and the historical province is thus Tavastia; Hme in Finnish, Tavastland in Swedish. By the 1200s, Sweden had came in. First, Sweden was in charge in the south-western Finland (which actually was the only Finland), and Novgorod in the eastern part. I guess that my birthplace was first just a stateless space between them. My town was founded in 1779 by the Swedish king Gustaf III, on the border of the provinces of Turku & Pori and Tavastia. Nowadays, Tampere is considered a part of Tavastia. Though, provinces do not exist any longer, and the region Tampere is located in is Pirkanmaa (Birkaland in Swedish). Sometimes the name Northern Tavastia is used in this sense.Between the years 1397-1523, the Kalmar Union was the only country in Scandinavia + Finland. In 1809, Sweden lost a war against Russia and gave Finland to it. The country Finland didn't exist at the time. Sweden just gave away its eastern provinces. Under the Russian Empire, Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy, whose grand prince was the Russian Czar. In 1917, Finland declared itself independent. Russia had undergone the revolution and the Bolshevist government granted the independence.However, in 1918 Finland got its own Civil War. Russia supported the Reds, whose goal was a revolution in Finland. My town was held by the Reds until the Whites conquered it. The Whites won and Finland continued its independent life as a non-socialist country.In 1992, Finland made the decision to join the European Community. In 1995, Finland joined the European Union.
