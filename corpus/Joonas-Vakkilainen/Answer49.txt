 The American English /r/ can indeed be produced with two different articulations, which produce a sound that is acoustically and perceptually the same. It can be either retroflex or bunched. In retroflex, the tongue is bent backwards so that the lower surface of the tip touches the palatum. In the bunched manner, the tip is not raised but the whole tongue is squeezed into a tighter package. There is no question of whether one of them is more correct than the other one, whether we are discussing it socially, dialectically or in a prescriptive manner. That's because nobody can see how the speaker locates their tongue, and as noted, nobody can hear it because the result is the same.Those two ways are used in American English. General British English uses alveoral approximant. Then, the tip of the tongue touches the alveoli, the palce above the teeth. This sound is quite similar to the retroflex sound but still different.
