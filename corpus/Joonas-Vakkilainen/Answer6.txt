 Linguistic knowledge helps you to see the rules of languages from a general perspective. You don't need to try to memorise rules that seem random when you understand the logic behind them. For example, if you are familiar with the concept of case-marking, you can easily learn how your target language functions with this feature. In Japanese, you don't need to struggle with all the particles: you can just check that Japanese has marked nominative, topic and accusative and instantly figure out how the system works. Understanding of tense and aspect systems helps almost with every languge: you don't need to get puzzled with Chinese time relations when you understand that it uses just aspects without tenses. Knowing how to analyse sentence structure is the key to the functions of words and forms in a phrase, and it is often useful when reading a complicated text. Distinguishing objects from adverbials is very important, and knowledge of transitivity helps to choose the right form or place for the words in the phrase.In the phonetic side, knowing things like rhythm types, reduction, quantity and lenition is good in the process of making your speech sound right. When you are familiar with the tongue movements and places in your mouth, you can quite easily find the sounds you need in the language.This applies to the structure of languages. It is important to note that achieving the fluent level in a language requires a lot of practical use of the language. Linguistic knowledge can be a very handy tool in that process.
