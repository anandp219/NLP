 The education itself does not cost. However, the membership of the student union is mandatory as well as is the health care payment. This year I paid 114 euros for them, which of course is not much. In addition, I get student and housing allowance, which is about 500 euros per month. I can receive it for 55 months maximum. After taxes the allowance is approximately 470 euros, but I get refunds if I don't earn much wage.Lunch is cheap but not free, unlike the other answer says (lunch is free in comprehensive school and high school). 1,94 euros of tax money is paid for a lunch, and students themselves pay 2,60 euros for it.
