 There is already a lot of practical advice for the technique of the trill, but let's focus on phonetics for a moment. It is easier to approach new sounds by linking them to sounds you already know. When people speak of rolled r's, they usually don't differentiate between the actual trill [r] and the flap []. The latter one is already familiar to Americans but it is used differently in the American English phonology from many other languages. In American as well as in some other Englishes, it is an allophone of unstressed intervocalic /t/ and /d/, as in latter and ladder. Because of that, the flap r shouldn't be a problem. People who don't speak American English or any language including the flap, it is better to start with [d]. It has the same place as [r] and []. [] is like a short [d], like a [d] produced by rapidly hitting the alveoli with the tip of the tongue. After mastering this technique, the flap is easy to extend into a trill. The trill [r] is like a series of flaps; like rapid flaps in a row with very short pauses between them. The flaps are of course not produced separately but with the very same airflow. First, locate the alveoli with the tip of your tongue (the [d] place), then start a strong airflow and try to catch the tip of your tongue with it. Then, we should note that languages that are said to have a rolled r, often don't use it as much as said. Scots use mostly the flap, not the real rolled version. In Russian, you can manage very well just with the flap. Actually, palatalised [r] can't be a trill, the only way to pronounce it is to use a single flap (as in ). Finnish r is traditionally classified as a trill, though many Finns (depending on the dialect and idiolect) use just the flap in the short quantity. The long quantity requires a trill but usually two rolls are enough, and some pronounce even the long r as without any trilling. On the contrary, in Spanish you must be able to differentiate between the flap and the trill (pero vs. perro). Furthermore, [r] really is a difficult sound to articulate. Many native speakers of rolled r languages have troubles in it at least in childhood. As a little kid, I replaced [r] with some kind of lateral fricative (I had a so called cheek r). Both of my brothers never learnt it. They use some uvular kind of sounds instead. Even our former president couldn't do it. I even know a guy who pronounces almost nothing in the place of [r].
