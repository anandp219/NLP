 In Finnish, this seems like English.Hn on Skotlannissa opiskelemassa yliopistossa.Unlike in English, it is clearly one sentence (without comma). Though it would be possible to use two phrases with comma if the latter one is an additional phrase. In that case, the additional phrase could just be a regular finite clause:Hn on Skotlannissa, opiskelee siell yliopistossa.('He/she is in Scotland, studies there in university.')The verb 'studying' (opiskelemassa) is in the 3rd infinite inessive. It is used as a progressive form (e.g. olen juuri nyt opiskelemassa = 'I'm right now studying'), but it also works as a locative answering to the question "where is she", where the answer is a verb. So, it resembles English.
