 You don't need any physical preparation. Some judo clubs are sport- and competition-orientated, some are more technically-focused. Instructors will tell what kind of additional practice they recommend if any. For example, many judokas practice with an elastic band, but you can't do that in advance because it requires knowledge of the techniques. If you are going to practice traditional judo or judo without competition, there is no need to have certain physical fit. Techniques matter, not your strength (which unfortunately may be otherwise in modern competitive judo).As for equipment, beginners' classes usually allow you to join with normal sport clothing. They will perhaps sell you a judogi very soon. It is also good to have slippers, because it is polite, and in many places compulsory, to wash you feet before training, and slippers enable you to walk to the tatami room without getting your feet dirty again. You can also check the dojo etiquette in advance: bow when you enter and leave the hall as well as when you enter and leave the tatami. Martial arts are individual sports (and traditionally they aren't sports at all) so you should be able to go there as you are without any (physical) pre-training.
