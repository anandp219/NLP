 In the Microsoft/Nokia product, it is the plural partitive of the Finnish word lumi, which means 'snow'. The plural partitive has the meaning of 'snows', where the amount of snow is indefinite. However, snow is an uncountable word so the plural doesn't make sense in most contexts. If we consider of the usage of this form in Finnish, we could look at a yard with several piles of snow, and say for example that lumia ei ole viel viety pois meaning literally that 'snows have not yet been taken away'. The negativeness requires the word snow to be in partitive. In a positive clause it would be in plural nominative (lumet on jo viety pois = 'snows have already been taken away'). Mostly we use singular just like English when speaking of snow. For example, sataa lunta ('it snows', lit. 'rains snow'), not sataa lumia. The plural partitive form lumia is mostly used in a proverb menneen talven lumia, meaning literally 'snows of the past winter', which means that something belongs to the past and should not be thought of any longer.
