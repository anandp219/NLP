 This is caused by your native language. As you haven't told your own language in the question details, I can't be language-specific here.Japanese differentiates between voiced and voiceless stops.  ta has a voiceless stop, /t/ in it, whereas  da has a voiced stop, /d/ in it. Those phonemes are formed in the same place, teeth, and in the same manner, stop, so they differ only in the voicing. If your language does not make this distinction, you may need a lot of practice to learn to hear it. On the other hand, your language may make a different kind of voicing distinction in stops. English has its unvoiced stops aspirated, which ensures that they are not blended with the voiced stops. Because of that, the voicing difference between the English voiced and voiceless stops is bigger than in Japanese. Because the Japanese voiceless stops don't have aspiration (sometimes they have little of it), an English-speaker may mix them with the voiced stops.
