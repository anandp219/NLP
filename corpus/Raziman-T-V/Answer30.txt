 Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'at is a denomination of Islam.Mirza Ghulam Ahmed [1].This sect was founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. He claimed to be the Islamic reformer of the fourteenth century and the promised Messiah in Islam. Though Ahmadi Muslims accept most of the teachings of mainstream Islam, there are a few controversial beliefs which make them different from the rest of the Muslim community, with the most important difference in the belief about Jesus. Most Muslims believe that Jesus was spared from crucifixion and is alive in heaven. But Ahmadiyya belief is that after escaping crucifixion, he moved to Kashmir and lived and died there. Thus Jesus was not the Mehdi awaited in Islam, and Ahmad himself was.Needless to say, Ahmadi beliefs are highly controversial in the mainstream Muslim community. The belief that Muhammad is the last prophet is central to mainstream Islam, and the status of Mirza Ghulam Ahmed in Ahmadiyya belief is unacceptable to non-Ahmadi Muslims. Most Muslims consider Ahmadis to be heretics and Kafirs. As a result, they face persecution in many Islamic nations, especially in Pakistan. The first Muslim Nobel Winner Abdus Salam had to leave Pakistan when Ahmadis were declared as non-Muslims by a constitutional amendment. After his death, his tombstone was defaced to remove the word "Muslim".Abdus Salam's tombstone, defaced to remove the word "Muslim" [2].Qadiani is a religious slur used to refer to Ahmadi Muslims, based on Mirza Ghulam Ahmed's birthplace.
