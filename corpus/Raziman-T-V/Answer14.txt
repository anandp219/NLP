 No. All Indian citizens are equal irrespective of whether their citizenship was attained by birth or by naturalisation. This is one thing that I really love about the constitution of India.Article 84 of the Constitution of India describes the eligibility criteria for members of parliament:A person shall not be qualified to be chosen to fill a seat in Parliament unless he -a) is a citizen of India, and makes and subscribes before some person authorised in that behalf by the Election Commission an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule;b) is, in the case of a seat in the Council of States, not less than thirty years of age and, in the case of a seat in the House of the People, not less than twenty-five years of age; andc) possesses such other qualifications as may be prescribed in that behalf by or under any law made by Parliament.There is no other law made by the parliament that prohibits foreign-born individuals from becoming members of parliament, and thus it is not required that the MP be born in India. Articles 74 and 75 describe the provisions regarding the council of ministers and the Prime Minister, and there are no additional eligibility criteria there.That is, a foreign-born citizen who satisfies the eligibility criteria can become the Prime Minister of India.
