 Restaurants are extremely expensive in Switzerland. Go to an average restaurant and have an average main dish, and it will cost you 20-25 CHF. Some restaurants give you a student discount, but the price even after the discount is going to be pretty high.The first cheap option you have is fast food restaurants. If you don't care too much about your health, there is a McDonalds in every corner of town that you can use (and other chains like Burger King, though less common). There are also a lot of Doner Kebab shops, and the food there is relatively cheap as well. Having a decent meal in either of these places should cost you under 10 CHF.Since you are a student, you might be lucky if your campus has decent restaurants. EPFL for example has half a dozen restaurants where you can have a very good meal for 8 CHF. The meals are usually balanced as well as tasty, and having so many restaurants on campus with multiple items on the menu guarantees sufficient variety.The cheapest and healthiest option, of course, is to cook for yourself. Buy raw materials from the nearest Migros. Look for Action (items on discount) or the M-Budget items (which are essentially permanently on discount). You should be able to obtain most spices there too, and the more exotic ones can be purchased from the Asian stores. Cooking large-scale and having multiple meals (or sharing with others) would be the way to go. This should be quite cheap - even if you eat non-veg, you can reduce the price per meal to 4CHF or less. I cook my royal pairing - chicken biriyani and shrimp roast - for 7/8 meals with around 30 CHF.Sticking to this routine, you should be able to keep your food expenses per month under 250CHF. Good luck!
