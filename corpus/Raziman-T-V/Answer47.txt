 In your introductory course, you would have learned about materials with a linear response (linear homogenous isotropic dielectrics are the only things anyone deals with usually). That is, the polarisation induced is proportional to the electric field. The consequence of this is that the light scattered by such objects has the same frequency as the incident light.But in reality, material response is not linear. Many materials have a nonlinear response and the relationship between polarisation and field is more complicated. In many cases, we can express the polarisation as a power series in the electric field. The first term in the series after the linear one is usually quadratic, and it results in scattering at twice the frequency of incident light, which is known as second harmonic generation (SHG).Now, these nonlinear effects are highly dependent on symmetry. For example, in crystals which show centrosymmetry, there can be no second harmonic generation from the bulk of the material but only from the surface. Thus we usually differentiate between bulk SHG and surface SHG.
