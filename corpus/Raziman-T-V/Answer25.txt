 Here is a geometric proof.We will switch the sign of [math]b[/math] and prove that [math]a^2 - a b + b^2 > 0[/math], which is identical to the original statement. The result is obvious if [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] have opposite signs. So let us consider the case when [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] have the same sign. Without loss of generality, take [math]a,b \geq 0[/math].Consider a triangle with two sides of lengths [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math], with the angle between the sides equal to [math]\gamma=60^\circ[/math].Schematic of the triangle [1].According to the Law of cosines, we have [math]c^2 = a^2 - ab + b^2[/math]. Since the square of the third side has to be positive, we have our result.In fact, we can use the same result for other values of the angle [math]\gamma[/math]. Considering all the angles in the range [math]\left[0,\pi\right][/math], we obtain that [math]a^2 + x a b + b^2[/math] is always positive for [math]-2 \leq x \leq 2[/math].Alternately, you can think of this as being a weighted mean of two positive numbers [math](a-b)^2[/math] and [math](a+b)^2[/math] with positive weights and is thus positive.[1] Image source: Wikimedia Commons.
