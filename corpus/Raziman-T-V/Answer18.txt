 More than four million tons.Solar luminosity is [math]3.846 \times 10^{26} \;\rm{W}[/math]. Using the most famous physics formula [math]E = m c^2[/math], we can find the reduction in mass this corresponds to, and that turns out to be [math]4.27 \times 10^9 \;\rm{kg/s}[/math].An alternate phenomenon by which sun loses mass is Solar wind. These are highly energetic charged particles which are released from the upper atmosphere of the sun. Turns out that the sun loses a million tons per second on average by this process.Coronal mass ejections can take away a billion tons of mass over a few days. Though massive, these processes are slow and relatively rare.Coronal mass ejection [1]Surprisingly, the electromagnetic radiation causes more loss of mass than actual particles being thrown out of sun.[1] Source : Wikimedia Commons.
