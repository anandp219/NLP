 Use linearity of expectation.We are essentially asked the following problem:You are given N objects [math]0 \ldots N-1[/math] with specified weights [math]w_i[/math]. At each step, you pick an object out of the remaining ones with probability proportional to its weight and discard it. How many steps will it be before object 0 is picked?To solve this, find this first : What is the probability that object i is chosen before object 0? This is clearly [math]\frac{w_i}{w_0+w_i}[/math] since the other objects don't matter while deciding the relative ordering between object 0 and object i.Using linearity of expectation, the expected total number of objects picked before object 0 is just the sum of probabilities of picking each of them before object 0. That is,[math]E = 1 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N-1} \frac{w_i}{w_0+w_i}[/math]Intuitive, isn't it? Although I have to admit that hindsight is 20/20. I thought of this only after seeing the solution, and perhaps couldn't have come up with it myself during the contest.
