 Because the first clocks were made in the northern hemisphere. At northern latitudes, the shadow of a sundial moves clockwise through the day.Before the advent of watches and clocks, sundials were used to measure time. One common way to build a sundial is to have a rod pointing in the direction of the pole (north/south, depending on the hemisphere), and tracing the motion of the shadow would give you the time [1].Sundial at Kingussie, UK [2].Now, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. At northern latitudes, this means that the tip of the shadow of the sundial moves clockwise. When people from the northern hemisphere invented watches, the hands were made to follow the direction of the sundials. This is why we have clocks which move clockwise. However, in the southern hemisphere, the motion of the shadow is reversed.Sundial at Perth, Australia [3]. Note how the hour markings are anticlockwise.Things would have been different if clocks were invented in the southern hemisphere. We would have had a different definition for clockwise!Notes:[1] There would be small seasonal corrections due to the ellipticity of the earth's orbit.[2] Image source: Wikimedia Commons.
