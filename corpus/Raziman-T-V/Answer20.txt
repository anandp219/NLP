 Because the earth is too light/the moon is too far.When a celestial body revolves around another, its orbital speed depends upon the the mass of the central object ([math]M[/math]) and the orbital radius ([math]a[/math]) [1] through:[math] v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{a}},[/math]where [math]G[/math] is the gravitational constant. Using [math]M_{\rm{sun}} = 2 \times 10^{30} \rm{kg}[/math] and [math]a_{\rm{earth}} = 1.5 \times 10^{11} \rm{m}[/math] we obtain the orbital speed of the earth-moon system around the sun to be 30 km/s.Plugging in [math]M_{\rm{earth}} = 6 \times 10^{24} \rm{kg}[/math] and [math]a_{\rm{moon}} = 3.8 \times 10^{8} \rm{m}[/math] shows that in comparison, the orbital speed of the moon around the earth is merely 1 km/s.That is, even when the orbital velocity of the moon around the earth is opposite to that of the earth-moon system around the sun, it is too small to make it seem to move in the opposite direction when viewed from the sun. The situation would have been very different if the earth were a thousand times more massive.In fact, the orbital speed of Jupiter around the sun is just 13 km/s, whereas its moon Io orbits Jupiter at 17km/s. As a result, it would be seen as retrograde from the sun.Notes:[1] We assume here that the orbitting object is much lighter than the other, and that the orbits are circular. When these conditions are not satisfied, the equation becomes slightly more complicated but the results do not change qualitatively.
