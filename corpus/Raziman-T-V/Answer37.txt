 razimantv : As boring as it gets.The first time I had to make any sort of online id was when I went to the national astronomy olympiad camp in 2004. I got selected for the international olympiad and needed to make an id so that they could contact me with further info. Those days, yahoo was the big thing and that is what I went for. For some reason, I did not get raziman and I chose the next best thing - razimantv for Raziman T V, surnames are abbreviated where I come from.Since then, all my online ids have been razimantv. So l have the same id on Topcoder, Codeforces and Codechef. The only exception is SPOJ where I lost the password for razimantv and made another account named raziman.
