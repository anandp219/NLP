 Most Indian Muslims have not read Bhagavad Gita.Many of them would have come across the more famous verses, but very few would have read it from beginning to end. I will go ahead and say that most Indian Muslims have not even read the Quran with the meaning from beginning to end, rather than merely reciting it in Arabic.Religion is mostly transferred from generation to generation rather than chosen personally. Most Indians are Hindus and Muslims and Christians simply because their parents were too and brought them up with the same religion. Their religious identity has little to do with their understanding of their own religious texts, leave alone a comparative analysis of religious texts from other religions. Most people would have come across mythological stories from their religions and others' too, but heavier books are a totally different matter.However, Indian Muslims do respect the Bhagavad Gita as a holy book of the Hindus. They do not consider it holy themselves, but do understand that it is something important for the Hindus. Except for those indulging in proselytizing, Muslims in general do not go about denigrating Gita or comparing it with the Quran. Since they don't read it and don't consider it something to follow, the question of respecting the teachings is moot.Muslims do have an issue with Gita being imposed on them as a part of saffronisation of education though. Why wouldn't you just keep your religious texts to yourself?
