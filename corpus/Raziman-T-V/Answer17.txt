 I do not speak for all Muslims, but I find it completely unjustifiable.I believe that everyone should have the right to practice and propagate their religion. Saudi Arabia prohibits public practice and proselytism by followers of other religions, conversion from Islam, and atheism. Such actions by a theocratic state are clear human right violations. I wish that Saudi Muslims and the international community would put pressure on the Saudi government to change such laws.I have seen some Muslims justify this practice by saying that it is the law of the land, but the point is that such a law itself is unjust. Section 377 is the law of the land in India, but the existence of the law does not make persecution of gays just. At least the Muslims who believe that they should have the right to practice and propagate Islam and build mosques in non-Islamic nations should support the same rights for non-Muslims in Islamic nations as well.Finally, I hope that people living in secular nations like India would realise that such oppressive laws in nations like Saudi Arabia are not a model to be followed but avoided at all costs. The number of people saying "If Saudi Arabia has laws for X, why don't we introduce similar (replacing Muslim with Hindu) laws in India?", even on Quora, is downright scary.
