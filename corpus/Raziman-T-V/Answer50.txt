 for Muslims girls as appeasement, for example - and merely blaming Muslims for high fertility is not doing India any good.Hindus trying to out-compete Muslims in fertility will be disastrous for IndiaThe alarmists seem to forget this, but Hindus outnumber Muslims five-to-one in India. Hence any rise in the fertility of Hindus in India will have five times the effect of that for Muslims. If Muslims population doubles in the next two decades, that will be some 150-200 million extra people that the nation has to deal with. On the other hand, if Hindus increase by even 50% in the same time, it will be half a billion people. I don't think our nation is equipped to deal with such a huge number. We are all going to get poorer and more unemployed.Asking any community (except Parsis, I guess) to increase their population is going to be disastrous for India. Members of the ruling government asking the majority community to increase their fertility flies in the face of all reason in the context of India.Hindus should realise that Muslims are not their enemyReally. We share the same land and constitution and cultures and languages. Our problems are pretty much the same too. Poverty and unemployment and a multitude of other problems are shared by all Indians irrespective of religion. Rapid population growth that needs to be managed is an Indian problem, not an exclusively Muslims one.But of course, what is the political gain in keeping everyone together? Agitating a group by scaring them about the "other" has perhaps been the most successful political strategy over centuries and continents. Today, there is a Hindu right wing political landscape shaping up, portraying Muslims (and even Christians) as the other. They are getting stronger by stoking fire in the minds of Hindus by scaring them of Muslims taking over India and what not. Just look at the number of questions on Quora asking about the possible Islamisation of India and you will see what is going on. I am afraid that polarisation and counter-polarisation are going to take India to a dangerous confrontation.The talks about Muslims planning to conquer India demographically is one such trope. There might be a few Muslim religious nuts with such ideas, but the community has no such plans. Engineering a real Hindu fertility rise to counter an imaginary Muslim takeover is going to create far more problems than anybody aspiring to get to power that way can solve.I am willing to accept that these people are a minority - that you have your few religious nuts as we have ours. But these are people weilding significant power today. They are MPs and ministers and political/religious leaders. National outrage and universal condemnation against such statements is the way to tell them and the other wannabes that such hate politics is not welcome in India.
