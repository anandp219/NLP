 If the city blocks are coloured black and white alternately like cells of a chessboard, every street connects a black block with a white block.Let us first state the problem in graph theoretic terms. We will denote the blocks by vertices of the graph and the streets by edges between them. The problem then reduces to this : Given the degree of every vertex in a graph but one, find the degree of that vertex.Now, for a general graph, it turns out that this problem cannot be solved. To see this, consider the two graphs below:Both graphs have vertices A and B with degree two. But vertex C in the graph on the left has degree two, whereas in the one on the right it has degree zero. Thus the solution is not unique in general, and we cannot find it just from the other values.But it turns out that in this particular case, we can indeed find the degree of the missing vertex. This is because the graph of blocks and streets is bipartite. Colour the blocks black and white alternately, as in a chessboard. Every street then connects a black block and a white block. That is, the total number of streets ending on black blocks has to be equal to the number ending on white blocks. Coming back to the graph theoretic formulation, the sum of degrees of black vertices is equal to the sum of degrees of white vertices. Using this, the degree of the missing vertex can be found easily.For example, in the sample case, assume that the central (missing) vertex is coloured black and has degree X. The sum of degrees of black vertices is 2+3+X+1+0 = 6+X, whereas the sum of degrees of white vertices is 2+1+3+1=7. Equating, we find the sample output X=1.
