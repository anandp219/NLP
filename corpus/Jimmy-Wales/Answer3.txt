 As an American living in London, I have one bit of information that may be helpful to any Americans reading this.The US concept of "middle class" is different in some important but subtle ways from the UK concept. In the US, the vast majority of people are considered to be middle class. And class is not thought to be inherited across generations so much (although of course, inevitably, it is)."Middle class" is much more narrowly defined in the UK to include mainly traditional "professionals" of various kinds.
