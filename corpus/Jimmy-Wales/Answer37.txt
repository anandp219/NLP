 No, Wikipedia has not been co-opted by elite dynastic banking parasites.Usually when people use expressions like that, they have been reading easily debunked conspiracy theories about various famous families who have been prominent in the banking industry. So, you'll probably want to stop doing that and read some real history.But in the meantime, to calm your nerves about Wikipedia itself, you can learn more about the financials of the organization here: Financial reports. You will learn that the vast majority of the money to support Wikipedia comes from the small donors. I can't guarantee that no bankers donated money, of course, and I can't even guarantee that no one from famous banking families has donated money. I can guarantee that it doesn't matter.And in terms of the editors of Wikipedia, they are ordinary people like you. You can go and talk to them anytime you like on the discussion page of any article that you're interested in.
