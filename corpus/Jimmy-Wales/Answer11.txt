 I have flown more than almost anyone, in almost every part of the world.If you show up at the airport, wearing normal clothes underneath, and a bathrobe over it, then you'll need to take it off like any other jacket or coat to pass through security.After that, I doubt if anyone will care or even notice. Except your mother.I'm a parent of two very small children, 2 and 4.5 as of this writing, as well as a teenager aged 14. When little kids do something provocative or boundary-testing, the best advice that I have learned as a parent is to simply ignore them. The only real purpose of the provocation is the provocation.As you are a teenager, and not a 4 year old, I recommend the same to your mother: she should ignore you. And as for you, you may wish to sit in a chair for 5 minutes and contemplate what is bothering you in life to make you behave like a 4 year old. If there's an issue you should really talk to your mother about regarding boundaries and life expectations, it'll go much better if you just address it in a mature way. Acting out over something as silly as a bathrobe on an airplane is not really going to get you where you want to go in life, wherever that may be.
