 The Queen is not a Nazi, and it is outrageous to even suggest such a thing.You are presumably referencing the historical family film footage described in this story: Queen Nazi salute film: Palace 'disappointed' at use - BBC NewsLet me quote from the story: "A Palace source said: 'Most people will see these pictures in their proper context and time. This is a family playing and momentarily referencing a gesture many would have seen from contemporary news reels.'No-one at that time had any sense how it would evolve. To imply anything else is misleading and dishonest.'"I would add to that: whatever one may think of the parents doing that gesture at that time (I am less forgiving than the palace quote given above), the Queen herself was 7 years old. It is highly unlikely that she knew any meaning to it at all.
