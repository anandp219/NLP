 By the nonexistent power vested in me as Founder of Wikipedia, I hereby dub thee His Royal Highness Prince Ashton, Duke of Kitturcat.This is absolutely without meaning of any kind, but you didn't waste your money on some Internet scam selling you a false title. And I bet your friends will find this far cooler anyway.Edit/Addition: Ok, that's a humorous answer and quite popular but someone pointed out that it isn't necessarily obviously helpful. I'm editing here to add some thoughts that I think are helpful - mainly expanding my comment about not wasting money on some Internet scam.First, no real royal titles are available for sale, period. There is a sense that if you donate enough money to a political party in the UK, through a system that isn't fully corrupt but looks questionable enough to many people, you may be rewarded with some kind of title - a knighthood/damehood or a peerage title. None of those are really *royal* titles, though.Second, the titles that are for sale are either from pretty much made-up nations like Sealand - such that I'd call them an Internet scam, or there are these odd "Lord of the Manor" titles that make you seem like a jerk if you buy one and try to use it. And the latter are kind of expensive. There are better ways to seem like a jerk, in my opinion.I've never known anyone who actually bought any sort of title - or anyway never anyone who admitted it. But it's a common enough question on the Internet, and like owning a little piece of land on Mars or paying to have a star named after you, I suppose some people do it just for the novelty as something to talk about as a joke with friends.So my point was - don't do that. There are more fun things to do. This is my personal advice.
