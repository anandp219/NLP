 Talk to them openly about it, just as you have done with us here. You'll want to tone down a bit the things that might offend them such as "neither of them have any hard skills that can't be done by myself" - statements like that will not put them in a mood to think of your proposal positively.If there really is that much imbalance, then you could quit today and start a competitor, right? And if that isn't correct, then observe that it isn't exactly true that you don't need them. :)Another idea that could work is to propose that you are named CEO and given a pay package that includes some significant equity which accrues if you hit some ambitious milestones. To sell them on this, point out that they'll be happy with 25% each of a company worth $$$$$ than 1/3 of a company only worth $. Make it a win-win in their minds, and structure the deal so that the equity position changes only as you deliver on your promises.
