 If we assume that the change is being done without any intention to change the overall constitutional structure and balance of power, so that the new role of President has very close to the same powers and responsibilities of the Monarchy, then there's obviously no one more qualified and respected and safe in the role than the Queen.However, even if the intention is to make no change in the overall power structure, there is a strong likelihood that an elected President would feel a public mandate to exercise some of the theoretical but traditionally unused powers of the office. It would be difficult to argue that the old conventions that have led to a largely ceremonial head of state would continue to hold in a Presidential Republic. Given this, I know my vote would be for the Queen over any politician, as I would feel quite comfortable that she wouldn't precipitate any constitutional crisis.
