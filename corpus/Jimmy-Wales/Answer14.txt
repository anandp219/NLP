 For the first part of my answer I'm going to assume you mean before the election is over.Probably not. Of the Democratic candidates, I have met Hilary Clinton a few times. Of course I know Larry Lessig quite well - he's a friend.Of the Republican candidates, I have never met any of them as far as I can remember.I live in London, although I do travel to the US quite a bit. But I'm not really all that plugged into the Washington scene.For the second part, I'll assume you mean "eventually". To estimate this I looked at the candidates from 2012 and 2008. (If anyone wonders why I am going into this much detail it's because I was curious myself!)2012 - I've met or had a phone call with 3 of the Republicans. Of the Democrats, I've not met any of them. (Note: I've never heard of most of them, probably because the big names sat out because it would have been taking on Obama as he went for a second term.)2008 - Republicans 2, Democrats 1.
