 I am not certain that this is actually true, as no one seems to have done an authoritative or even plausible study of the question (to my knowledge), but anecdotally I believe that it is probably true.Based on my experiences, I think that the main reason is Jewish pride in the many accomplishments of Jewish people. But a secondary reason is anti-semitic fascination with whether or not prominent people are Jewish.Both of those combined means that people seem, on average, to care more whether someone is Jewish. I don't think that's a good thing about the world, but it is nonetheless a thing about the world.There are random pages about me on the Internet which say that I am, or that I'm not. The question has been asked in Quora, I believe. No one ever asks if I'm Muslim or Christian.
