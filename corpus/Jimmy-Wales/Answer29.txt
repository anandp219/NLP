 There are several reasons: 1. I'm extremely busy with TPO and not really willing to give up a year of my life full-time for a political campaign.2. I'm not a Republican. I'd make a more plausible Republican than Larry, so if we were to launch 2 campaigns, me the Republican, him the Democrat, that would make some sense. But I'm not a Republican.3. I find being in the public eye relatively unpleasant. And to enter politics in the United States could invite a pretty unpleasant harassment of my family.4. Another answer, which I believe to be mistaken, questions whether or not I'm eligible given than I have lived in London for a few years. Well, whether or not I'm eligible based on that, I actually do live in London. In order to make a credible run, I'd have to move full-time to the US.5. I think Larry can win. Yes, of course it's a long shot - but an exciting long shot. And he'd make a better president than me. So I'd rather support him. :)
