 Virtually none whatsoever, in the same sense that Marxist theories generally have virtually no impact whatsoever in any practical endeavor.But to give a bit more detail. The Wikipedia entry on "Technological determinism" gives several quotes outlining what the term is generally understood to mean: "echnological determinism has been summarized as 'The belief in technology as a key governing force in society ...' (Merritt Roe Smith). 'The idea that technological development determines social change ...' (Bruce Bimber). It changes the way people think and how they interact with others and can be described as '...a three-word logical proposition: "Technology determines history"' (Rosalind Williams) . It is, '... the belief that social progress is driven by technological innovation, which in turn follows an "inevitable" course.' (Michael L. Smith). This 'idea of progress' or 'doctrine of progress' is centralised around the idea that social problems can be solved by technological advancement, and this is the way that society moves forward. Technological determinists believe that "'You can't stop progress', implying that we are unable to control technology" (Lelia Green). This suggests that we are somewhat powerless and society allows technology to drive social changes because, "societies fail to be aware of the alternatives to the values embedded in it [technology]" (Merritt Roe Smith)." Technological determinismThose are not views which I have ever heard expressed by either Lila Tretikov nor Sue Gardner, both of whom have a much more complex and nuanced understanding of the relationship between gender and technology.But it's also important to harken back to what I said about "practical endeavor". We know there are several different issues with Wikipedia's gender gap - some of them are technological, some of them are social in the sense of issues in society at large, and some of them are social in the sense of issues with Wikipedia's own internal culture.
