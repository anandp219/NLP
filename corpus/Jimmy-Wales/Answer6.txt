 It's important to step back and think about the original principles here. Why does Wikipedia have notability criteria? It isn't about making a value judgment as to whether a person is "important enough". It's about asking the question: "Are there sufficient third party reliable sources to be able to actually write a biography?"For some record holders, the answer will of course be yes. But because Guinness recognizes a lot of cute, funny, and awesome records that get no attention elsewhere, for many of the record holders, we won't know anything reliable enough to write a real biography.
