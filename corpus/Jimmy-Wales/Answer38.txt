 I have lived in London for several years.One thing to know about London is that it is very much a city of highly diverse neighborhoods. So there is probably no single answer here that would cover the entire city. There are very liberal and gay-friendly parts of town and there are areas which are more conservative and with a large Muslim population - but even in this case see my note below for some additional thoughts.I can only speak confidently about areas where I've lived and worked - basically central London from Shoreditch to Notting Hill. In these areas, not only will no one mock you, I rather suspect that very few will even particularly notice.Regarding the other areas, I hope someone who is more directly familiar will answer, but I do note this: even though an area like Tower Hamlets has a Muslim population of around 100,000 (35%) and should be presumed to be more conservative on gay issues, there are reasons to think you'd be fine there. First, some quick googling shows that there are a few gay bars and pubs in Tower Hamlets. And second, the taboo against same-sex holding hands is not really a Muslim thing anyway. To quote Wikipedia: "In many cases, people of the same sex holding hands while walking is considered an ordinary display of friendship without romantic connotations." (from: Etiquette in the Middle East) See also: The Basics; Why Arab Men Hold Hands from the New York Times.I am unsure how that plays out in terms of the culture of London, I just throw it out there as a point for further research. For one thing, the London Muslim population is not predominantly Arab, so the links above may not apply - I just don't know.
