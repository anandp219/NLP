 In order to run for Prime Minister, one must first be a Member of Parliament (MP), and be the leader of the political party which is able to form a majority (either alone or in coalition with others).Given that no monarch has entered the House of Commons since 1642, when Charles I stormed in to attempt to arrest some MPs, it would be impossible for her to do the job of MP.Note well that many very important principles in the UK constitutional system are longstanding traditions and conventions rather than written legislation. I'm knowledgeable but far from an expert - but I'm pretty sure that there is no formally written legal obstacle forbidding the Queen from standing for election as a Member of Parliament - but it would be considered highly unconstitutional.I believe if a monarch for some reason wanted to pursue this course of action, Parliament would act to force an abdication. Or to abolish the monarchy completely.
