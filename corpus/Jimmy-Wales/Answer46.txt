 I'm not sure I understand the question. One is a social network, one is a mobile network. That's how they are different. :-)Maybe you meant to ask: what is the relationship between them? This, I can explain.The concept of TPO phone service is that we give 10% of your monthly bill to the cause of your choice. And we give 25% of the company's profits to charity. And our prices are a good value in the marketplace. How do we afford this? We have to eliminate most of the marketing budget and spread virally, by word of mouth, primarily online.We say to you: you can stay with your current carrier, and they'll spend a huge chunk of your money on more tv commercials, radio commercials, magazine and newspaper ads, flyers mailed to your home, billboards, bus signs, etc. Or you can switch to us and we'll spend that money on something that you care about. What we ask in return is that you tell your family, tell your friends.And the social network is a great tool for doing that. It also serves as a donation platform for our cause partners, and we offer that to the partners without commissions - this drives people to the platform, where, eventually, they may want to buy phone service.The basic concept is to get rid of the traditional marketing budget and instead be fully community-oriented.I hope this answer clarifies things for you!
