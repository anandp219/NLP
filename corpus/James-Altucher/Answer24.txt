 I made the decision that ended up being unfortunate for this man and his family. But you can tell me if you think I made the right decision or not. We were pitching the US Post Office on a big project. It could've been a million dollar project or more. Which was big for my small company. Everyone worked late Friday. Everyone worked Saturday and Sunday. The project proposal got finished. Relief! I handed to X. "Send this to them as fast as possible." So he used Federal Express. To the US Post Office. They called us the next day (10am delivery) and said, "are you kidding?" They said, "You used FedEx to pitch the US Post Office?" We could've come up with something smart to say, "Hey, that's why you have to improve your branding." But we didn't and that would not have worked anyway. You don't FedEx the US Post Office on a million dollar project. This guy wasn't an intern. He was an employee for five years and just had his first kid. I had to fire him. Not because he made a dumb error. Not because he was a bad guy. But everyone worked hard on that project. And it meant a lot of salaries would get paid if we got that project. The project meant something to a lot of people. He did a bad job. But bad jobs are excusable. But you can't set a precedent that we can just give up on millions of dollars and all is ok. There has to be consequences. I don't know if I did the right thing. I'll never know. He lost his job and was probably scared for his family. But other people lost their jobs much later because we didn't have a potential million dollar project to fall back on. Running a company is hard and it's painful and a CEO is scared all of the time (at least I was). And that's why I will never be CEO of a company again.
