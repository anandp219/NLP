 I can to change myself each day: to be physically healthier, to be around emotionally healthy people ,to be create, to be grateful. Then maybe I can have a head start on changing the world. 13. I think its very important to have a feedback loop, where youre constantly thinking about what youve done and how you could be doing it better. I think thats the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.I'm invested in about 30 companies. The companies that fail are when CEOs smoke their own crack. Technology, competition, customers are constantly changing. But we have a cognitive bias to think that the activity we have invested the most time in is, of course, a GREAT activity. What could be wrong with it? So it's important to constantly question this evolution-based cognitive bias with constant questioning as if one were an outsider looking in. Without that, businesses fail. 14. I wouldnt say I have a lack of fear. In fact, Id like my fear emotion to be less because its very distracting and fries my nervous system.A small level of fear is motivational. It forces me to have a backup plan. The average multimillionaire supposedly has seven sources of income. They all have backup plans. Even Elon Musk has Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity, and probably a dozen other companies he's peripherally involved in. Any endeavor I do, I always ask two questions: "What is my plan B?" and "What is my evil plan?" Meaning what do I hope to learn from this that nobody else expects15. Life is too short for long-term grudges.I always think that I'm the average of the five people I spend the most time with. So this quote is important to me. Don't spend time with people who can even incite a grudge. I try to spend time with the people I love and who love me.16. Dont be afraid of new arenas.Again, inspiration is a risk. It means stepping out of the comfort zone where you've never been before. I try as an exercise to figure out at least one thing a day to do that is outside my comfort zone. One time I was talking to Noah Kagan and he suggested something simple: never time you go for coffee, ask for a 10% discount after they ring up your order. This sounds trite compared with planning a ship to Mars but it really made me nervous when I tried it. It was good practice. Maybe next thing will be the trip to Mars. 17. I think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.I thought about this when I read it. I think it's ok for "ordinary" people to be ordinary also. Ordinary is beautiful. But I think every day it's worth trying to be a little better (1%, an amount so small it can't be measured) in physical health, emotional health, creativity, and gratitude. Maybe that is a path to extraordinary as that 1% compounds. But I don't want the pressure of "future extraordinary". I just want to be a little better today18. I could either watch it happen or be a part of it.Sometimes people say to me, "I missed the boat" or "I am too late". I think it's never too late to do what you love."What you love is always on the shore, waiting for you to arrive, waiting with open arms.19. Being an Entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of deathPeople say to me, "I hate my cubicle. I want to be an entrepreneur." Entrepeneurship is a disaster. 85% of entrepreneurs fail and failure is not fun at all. Not to mention you have to deal with customers, employees, investors - they are all your bosses and not the other way around. Then you have to sell, you have to execute, you have to build, you have to exit, you have to grow. I like Elon Musks's approach of having many things to work on. Many Plan Bs. So any one entrepreneurial endeavor doesn't take up all the mind space.20. "I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact."I highly recomend Andy Weir's book, "The Martian". He self-published it. Then it got picked up by a major publisher. Now Ridley Scott doing the movie. Discusses this very topic.21. On his favorite book when he was a teen, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy": It taught me that the tough thing is figuring out what questions to ask, but that once you do that, the rest is really easy."Here's my favorite part of Hitchher's Guide to the Galaxy: the idea that all you really need from a materialistic perspective is a towel. Then the Universe sort of takes care of things after that. Hygiene is key22. "I just want to retire before I go senile because if I don't retire before I go senile, then I'll do more damage than good at that point.""Retirement" is an interesting word, invented by the actuaries who used statistics to come up with social security. So I doubt Elon Musk will ever retire. In fact, from a mortality perspective the two most dangerous years in life are the year you are born and the year you retire.------So I never interviewed him. But maybe read and watched several dozen interviews and wrote down my favorite quotes. Then I wrote what I learned from them. I want to learn from everyone. That's how I get inspired. If you don't agree with me, maybe you learned different things. But I like these quotes and I hope this somewhat fits the answer.
