.Always the first line or two has to put them at ease.AN IMPORTANT POINTt: I'm almost always recording before they realize I'm recording. Often the best gems are when the "pressure of the interview" hasn't started yet.I don't do this to fool anyone. I tell them afterwards and they usually laugh. Because usually the casual talk is where we really begin to relate.C) SET EXPECTATIONSI usually tell people right in the beginning what I hope my listeners or readers will get out of the interview.I don't want to just promote someone's book or show. I want to learn something. I want my listeners to learn something. I want to laugh. And then...D) I WANT THE PERSON I INTERVIEW TO LEARN SOMETHINGI don't like an interview to beME: questionPERSON: Deep answerJust like I want to have conversations with my friends rather than interviews, I like the interviews on my podcast to be like conversations.An interview is like a guided tour through someone's life or a particular work they have recently done.A conversation is an exploration that two people have where hopefully they can meet somewhere in the middle and be curious about each other's answers. That's my ideal.Like anyone, the people I'm interviewing have problems in their lives. I like to hear those problems and offer my two cents, whether they help or not. I want to make someone think without coming across as annoying.This is very difficult. But if I'm listening close enough to what they are saying I can hear the small sorrows and successes that are in the spaces between words. That is often where the real interview takes place.E) CURIOSITYI hate when someone says something I don't understand. I don't hate them, I hate the feeling I get when I don't understand something.It's like this itch on my back that I can't quite reach.If I'm curious about something, I'll ask. Some interviewees (Wayne Dyer) if you just hit "Go" he'll talk for an hour. But I get curious about almost everything he says.I want my life to be better so I need to understand everything. And if I think he's missing something or skipping something because he's speaking at level I don't understand, then I stop him until I understand.If you are afraid to be curious for fear of offending them or interrupting too much then there is no point in doing the interview.As an example, when Coolio mentioned he broke his cocaine habit, I was really curious. It's not easy to break a habit like that. So I had to interrupt him when he had already gone onto the next thought and say, "How did you break that habit?"F) DON'T HAVE AN AGENDAI never argue with someone I'm interviewing. I'm not an investigative journalist. Nor do I really have any strong opinions about anything. But if I'm not sure I agree, then I want to know why someone thinks the way they do. I want to learn something from it.There's always many sides to every story. Who am I to judge?If you turn away from the sun, you're in the dark. But the sun is still there, shining equally on everyone. In an interview we're all equally lit in the sun, no matter what thoughts go through our head or what experiences we've had.The listeners are the sun. I can either show them light, or darkness. And they can't see if it's just darkness.G) ALWAYS BRING IT BACK DOWN TO THE LISTENERYou know who your audience is. The person you're interviewing either doesn't know or doesn't care. I don't say this in a critical way. Their business is their business and your business is your audience.Make sure when things go on a tangent, that some value is extracted for the audience. Pull it back.H) REPEAT AND SUMMARIZEEvery now and then take what has been said and try to summarize in verbal bullet points the value that has been expressed in a down-to-Earth useable fashion.This gives them an opportunity to either agree, expand on, or correct.I) ASK THEM SOMETHING THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN ASKED BEFOREI like it when someone I've interviewed calls me later and says, "Friends are listening to this and saying they've never seen this side of me."You have to dig in your preparation and listen during the interview to find a path that they have never been taken on before. On that path is the gold.J) WHAT DID YOU LEARN?Right after an interview is done, I almost completely forget it. So I always try to take notes or write down things right afterwards else I'll forget.If I do all of the nine other things above then I will definitely get value for myself out of the interview. Things I've learned that can improve my life.An interview is never just audio, or video, or text. It's everything and you have to remember the critical points, the points that scream, "LEARN THIS!" that you can then repeat in every medium where you publish the interview.Many of these things are completely unexpected. From almost everyone I've interviewed I learn something new that was not planned, either by me and in many cases by the interviewee. These are often the most valuable to share.---One time, way back when, I was interviewing a professional dominatrix for my 3am project. She said something I never forget. "People don't pay me for the things I do to them. People pay me so that when it's over I leave."Don't drag the interview out hoping for more gems than might exist there.When it's over, leave. Hopefully at the end you have a new friend and you've learned many new things and have had a fun time and will make people laugh and give people value.The best interview is when all the equipment is off, you take a deep breath, and you realize that in the past hour your life just got a little bit better.
