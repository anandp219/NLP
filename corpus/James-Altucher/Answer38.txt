 to create big ideas. Larry Page is recreating this with his new corporate structure. -----"We don't have as many managers as we should, but we would rather have too few than too many."The 20th century was the century of middle-class corporatism. It even became a "law" called "The Peter Principle" - everyone rises to their level of incompetence. One of the problems society is having now is that the entire middle layer of management is being demoted, outsourced, replaced by technology, and fired. This is not a bad or a good thing (although it's scary). But it's a return to the role of masters and apprentices without bureaucracy and paperwork in the middle. It's how things get done. When ideas go from the head into action with few barriers in the middle. To be a successful employee, you have to align your interests with those of the company, come up with ideas that further help the customers, and have the mandate to act on those ideas, whether they work or not. That's why the employee who wrote much of the code inside the Google search engine, Craig Silverstein, is now a billionaire. Where is he now? He's an employee at online education company, The Khan Academy. ------If you ask an economist what's driven economic growth, it's been major advances in things that mattered - the mechanization of farming, mass manufacturing, things like that. The problem is, our society is not organized around doing that.Google is now making advances in driverless cars, delivery drones, and other methods of automation. Everyone gets worried that this will cost jobs. But just look at history. Cars didn't ruin the horse industry. Everyone simply adjusted. TV didn't replace books. Everything adjusted. The VCR didn't shut down movies. The Internet didn't replace face to face communication (well, the jury is still out). ---------"What is the one sentence summary of how you change the world? Always work hard on something uncomfortably exciting!"Not everyone wants to create a driverless car. Or clean energy. Or solve a billion person problem. But I have a list of things that are uncomfortably exciting to me. They are small, stupid things. Like I'd like to write a novel. Or perform standup comedy. Or maybe start another business based on my ideas for helping people. Every day I wake up a tiny bit afraid. But I also try to push myself a little closer in those directions. I know then that's how I learn and grow. Sometimes I push forward. Sometimes I don't. I want to get more comfortable with being uncomfortable. -----"I do think there is an important artistic component in what we do. As a technology company Ive tried to really stress that."Nobody knows what the definition of Art is. How about: something that doesn't exist except in the imagination, that you then bring out into the real world that has some mix of entertainment, enlightenment, and betterment. I don't know. Something like that. Certainly the iPad is a work of art. And the iPad has created works of art. And when I first saw a driverless car I thought, "that's beautiful". I'm going to try and put my fingerprint on something today. And maybe it will be art. -----"The idea that everyone should slavishly work so they do something inefficiently so they keep their job  that just doesnt make any sense to me. That cant be the right answer."We've been hypnotized into thinking that the "normal life" is a "working life". If you don't "go to work" then you must be sick or on the tiny bit of vacation allotted to you each year. What if everything you did you can inject a little bit of leisure, a little bit of fun into it. I have fun writing, except when I think I have to meet a deadline (work). I have fun making a business that people actually use except when I think about money too much (work). When you are at the crossroads and your heart loves one path and doesn't love the other, forget about which path has the money and the work, take the path you love.------------"We want to build technology that everybody loves using, and that affects everyone. We want to create beautiful, intuitive services and technologies that are so incredibly useful that people use them twice a day. Like they use a toothbrush. There aren't that many things people use twice a day." What a great idea for a list of the day!What are ten things that can be invented that people would use twice a day?------"You need to invent things and you need to get them to people. You need to commercialize those inventions. Obviously, the best way we've come up with doing that is through companies."I was speaking to Naveen Jain, who made his billions on an early search engine, InfoSpace. He just started a company to mine rare earth minerals on the Moon. But his real goal is extra-planetary colonization. Somehow we got around to the question of why have a company in the middle of that. He has billions. He can just go straight for the colonization part. He said, "Every idea has to be sustainable. Profitability is proof that an idea is sustainable." "You may think using Google's great, but I still think it's terrible."K. Anders Ericsson made famous the "10,000 hour rule" popularized later by Malcom Gladwell. The rule is: if you practice WITH INTENT for 10,000 hours then you will be world-class. He then wondered why typists would often reach a certain speed level and then never improve no matter how many hours. After doing research, its because they forgot the "With intent" part. They were satisfied with "good enough". You have to constantly come up with new metrics to measure yourself, to compete against yourself, to better the last plateau you reached. Google is great. But it can be better. Having this mindset always forces you to push beyond the comfort zone. Once they changed the way typists viewed their skills (by recreating the feeling of "beginner's mind") the typists continued to get faster. We have a mantra: dont be evil, which is to do the best things we know how for our users, for our customers, for everyone. So I think if we were known for that, it would be a wonderful thing.Many people argue whether or not Google has succeeded at this. That's not the point The point is: Values before Money.A business is a group of people with a goal to solve a problem. Values might be: we want to solve a problem, we want the customer to be happy, we want employees to feel like they have upward mobility, etc. Once you lose your values, you'll lost the money as well. This why family-run businesses often die by the third generation ("Shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations). The values of the founder got diluted through his descendants until the company failed. I spoke to Dick Yuengling about this (CEO of the largest independent beer maker and a fifth generation business). His family found an interesting way to solve the problem. The business is not inherited. Each generation has to BUY the business from the generation before it. To do that, each generation needs its own values, its new way of doing things that keeps the brand fresh and ongoing. --------------"I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. Since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. In fact, there are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name."Our parents have our best interests at heart and tell us how to be good adults. Our schools have our best interests. Our friends, colleagues, sometimes our bosses, sometimes government, think they have our best interests. But it's only when everyone thinks you are crazy that you know you are going to create something that surprises everyone and really makes your own unique handprint on the world. And because you went out of the comfort zone, you're only competing against the few other people as crazy as you are. ----------------You know what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream? And you know that if you don't have a pencil and pad by the bed, it will be completely gone by the next morning. Sometimes it's important to wake up and stop dreaming. When a really great dream shows up, grab it.For every article I've ever written, there's at least ten more I left behind in the middle of the night thinking I would remember in the morning. I have to beat myself in the head. I . Will. Not. Remember....Must. Write. Down.It's hard to wake up. And that's the only thing worth remembering. It's hard to wake up. ----------------"I have always believed that technology should do the hard work - discovery, organization, communication - so users can do what makes them happiest: living and loving, not messing with annoying computers! That means making our products work together seamlessly."This is a deep question - who are you? If you have a mechanical hand, is that "you"? Conversely, if you lose a hand, did you lose a part of you. Are you no longer a complete person? The complete you? If an implant is put into your brain to access Google, does that effect who you view your self to be? When books were invented, memory suffered. We no longer had to remember as much, because we can look things up. Does that make our brains less human? I bet memory has suffered with the rise of Google. Does this mean our consciousness has suffered? When we created fire, we outsourced part of our digestion to this new invention. Did this make our stomachs less human? With technology taking care of the basic tasks of our brain and body, it allows us to achieve things we couldn't previously dream possible. It allows us to learn and explore and to create past the current comfort zone. It allows us to find the happiness, freedom, and well-being we deserve. -----------"Over time, our emerging high-usage products will likely generate significant new revenue streams for Google as well as for our partners, just as search does today. "This is it. This is why Larry Page has re-oriented Google into Alphabet. Don't waste your most productive energies solving a problem that now only has incremental improvements. Re-focus the best energies on solving harder and harder problems. Always keeping the value of "how can I help a billion people" will keep Google from becoming a Borders bookstore (which went out of business after outsourcing all of their sales to Amazon). How does this apply to the personal? Instead of being a cog in the machine for some corporation, come up with ways to automate greater abundance. Always understand that coming up with multiple ways to help people is ultimately the way to create the biggest impact. Impact then creates health, friendship, competence, abundance, and freedom. Oh my god, this answer is too long. And believe it or not, I cut it in half. If I can just wake up every day and remind myself of these quotes by Larry Page I know I will have a better life. But this is also why he created Alphabet and put Google underneath it. To save the world. To save me.
