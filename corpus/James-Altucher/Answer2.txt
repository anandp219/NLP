 by building up your idea muscle discussed in many other posts here), the big ideas become smaller and smaller. Until there is no idea too big. Nothing you cant at least attempt.On a much smaller scale I can state a few examples of my own but Ill stick with one. I had an idea to create a financial news site that didnt have any news but was just a site made up of various methods to come up with investment ideas. In particular, by piggybacking the investment ideas of the greatest investors. I spec-ed out the site the morning I had the idea, I put the spec on Freelancer, several developers contacted me with prices, and I hired one of them. Within a few weeks, version 1.0 of the site was released, Stockpickr. 7 months later and millions of unique users later, I sold the profitable company to The Street.So the question is not necessarily, when is an idea too big its: how do I make all ideas smaller and achievable. You do this by developing the idea muscle.One of the ways to build the idea muscle is by writing down 10 ideas a day.About what?About anything. It doesnt matter if they are business ideas, book ideas, ideas for surprising your spouse in bed, ideas for what you should do if you are arrested for shoplifting, ideas for how to make a better tennis racquet, anything you want. The key is that it has to be ten or more.You want your brain to sweat.You want your brain to hurt to come up with more and more ideas. One possibility right now is to list ten ideas that are too big for me and what the next steps might be. For instance, one idea might be launch solar panels into outerspace to more efficiently generate solar power. Another idea might be, genetically engineer a microbe that sucks the salt out of water. I have no idea if thats even possible. Another idea might be, within one year I am going to write a book and give away a million copies for free.The first step would be to write the book. Then maybe I can crowd fund on kickstarter to give the book away for free. OR, I can maybe print up nano-sized copies of the book so that you can only read it with a microscope but it would only cost me a couple of sheets of paper to print up a million copies. And so on. With the solar panels, I can call up SpaceX and see how much it would cost to rent space. For the microbe that desalinatesI have no idea. Can you help me?You dont ever have to look at these ideas again. The purpose is not to come up with a good idea. The purpose is to have 1000s of ideas over time. To develop the idea muscle and turn it into a machine.Here are some FAQ's about becoming an idea machine:A) Do you have a theme each day for your ideas?Yes. As a simple example it might be 10 businesses I can start? Or 10 books I can write or 10 chapters I can write for a book on quality parenting (which would obviously be a fiction book).A theme is like a target, and knowing that you can come up with 10 decent ideas gets you closer and closer to hitting the bullseye on the target.B) What if I cant come up with 10 ideas?Heres the key: the first three ideas are always easy. The next two are a little harder, and for me, I find that ideas 5-10 make my brain literally sweat. It almost hurts.Ideas, art, business, life is all about connecting the dots of one area of your life with the dots in other areas of your life.Doing this directly translates into biologically building up the neural pathways between collections of neurons in your brain.This is what changes you from becoming a person with the occasional idea, to a creative person, to an idea machine. You become the one-eyed king in the land of the blind.D) My idea muscle has atrophied. How long will it take to become an idea machine?If you come up with 10 ideas a day for 180 days Im pretty convinced based on what Ive seen from 100s or 1000s of others then you will be a full force idea machine.To read the other FAQ's, click here.
