 outside my job? Same thing.I'm not going to give the BS line: "children are our greatest teachers". They aren't really. They are mostly annoying. They are hard work. The best thing a kid teaches us is patience and how to avoid these new, very enticing kinds of anger and annoyance. I had nothing extra on my "to do" list this past week. But when I look back at my "I did" list I'm very proud. If I had to pick one thing I'd want to share it would be to check out my podcast with Hugh Howey. Two and a half years ago, Hugh was working in a bookstore, shelving books for $10 an hour. On the side he was writing novels. He had no publisher so he was self-publishing through Amazon and then hoping some of his friends or family would read his books. "I thought if one reader liked a book then it would be worth it," he told me. I would give up on one novel if nobody read it. I'm a wimp. Most publishers will give up on you as well. Which is why Hugh kept self-publishing.Hugh wrote nine novels. He had a full time job the entire time.On his ninth novel (ninth!), "WOOL", a lot of people liked it. So he wrote "WOOL 2", then "WOOL 3", then "WOOL 4", then the "WOOL Omnibus" that collected them all. Soon his books were all in the top ten for science fiction on Amazon. Now everyone was reading his books! And people were reading his back books. He had done zero marketing. Doing that one thing a day proved to be the BEST marketing. This is what many people don't get. So he wrote more: "Dust", "Shift", "Sand", and more. His one thing each day: write. Ridley Scott bought the movie rights to "WOOL". Simon & Schuster bought the rights to distribute in bookstore. When I visited Amazon last week I spent time with people in every department of publishing. They all spoke about Hugh's success but also about the successes of many authors now choosing the self-publishing route. Persistence is a magic power. Again: "If one reader liked my novels then it's worth it". He quit his full time job. He writes full time. I am sure Hugh's "I did" list is much greater than his "to-do" list. He answers emails. He has to deal with the business now of being a writer. He came on my podcast. He writes a blog. He analyzes data about self-publishing versus traditional publishing. He approves covers and goes over his royalties I am assuming. But every day he writes. Pick your one thing. Do it. Share it if you can. And at the end of the day or week, write your "I Did" list. Life doesn't have to die in the cubicle. Weave magic out of the hidden silences in between meetings. Create your one thing a day. Good or bad. Who cares? You'll get better. And then shout as loud as you can, "I DID IT!"So let me know in the comments...what was on your "I Did" list today?Read More:How To Be a Slave The One Thing I Remind Myself of All Day
