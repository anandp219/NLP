 Independence. Thomas Jefferson directly plagiarized John Locke when he wrote the Declaration of Independence. James Madison even admitted later: The object was to assert, not to discover truths. Chess. Bobby Fischer learned Russian when he was 14 years old so he could steal ideas from the Russian chessplayers in the magazine 64. He used those opening ideas to win the US Championship at the age of 15 in the mid 1950s. Art. Roy Lichtenstein directly stole from the cartoon strip True Romance to repackage and then resell for (now) millions. Star Wars. Whether you call it inspiration or plagiarism, George Lucas took ideas from everything from Taoism to Asimovs Foundation series, to Joseph cambell, Greek Mythology, King Arthur, etc. Vonnegut. Kurt Vonnegut said he cheerfully ripped off the plot of Brave New World for his novel, Player Piano- and Aldous Huxley, in turn, stole it from Eugene Zamatians We Groupon and every other business. Almost all current successful internet businesses are the result of lifting (and improving) the ideas from past businesses. Groupon is a direct descendant of the failed Paul Allen company, Mercata (remember?). Facebook (remember Geocities? Or, heaven forbid, Tripod). And why didnt the World Wide Web Worm: succeed (the first search engine that I can think of).  Comedy. In standup comedy, stealing (or improving on) routines has been common. Robin Williams was constantly accused of this early in his career and his reply was that he was so stream of consciousness he sometimes had no idea where the ideas were coming from (i.e., they were coming from his friends even minutes after their acts). Bill Cosby has admitted stealing some jokes from George Carlin, Rosie ODonnell was known to borrow from Jerry Seinfeld early in their careers. Sam Kinison has accused Bill Hicks of joke thievery who, in turn, has accused Denis Leary of stealing parts of his routine. 3AM. I personally think Comedy Centrals show Insomnia is somewhat a ripoff of my III:am idea for HBO (particularly since I pitched the idea to Comedy Central first).Unfortunately, stealing is not a shortcut to success. Stealing is THE ONLY PATH to success.How do you steal? Try this. Pick a field you are passionate about: whether its blogging, romance novel writing, comedy, internet entrepreneurship, art, cooking, cancer research, etc. Read everything you can about the field. Heres what you have to read minimally:At least the history of that field from 1800 on. Try to read at least 10 different sources on the historyAll of the latest blogs in the field. Try to have 100 different sources here.All the basic techniques the current leading experts in the field use. Read all of their biographies or autobiographies. Pick your five favorite sources in the field. For instance, if I wanted to write a novel: Id pick my five favorite novelists. If I wanted to start a business in local Internet Id pick my five favorite local Internet companies. If I wanted to blog, Id pick my five favorite bloggers. If I wanted to be a management consultant, Id steal directly from Peter Drucker, Jim Collins, etc. Get one element that you like from each source. What element do you think stands out that makes them a success. Add your own improvement. Or not. You can even start out with a direct copy and throw in your twist at the end. Ignore all the haters. The more people hate you, the more money you will make. Trust me on that.Im hoping Mollie grows up and learns how to be just as good a thief as her dad.See what else I stole at Altucher Confidential
