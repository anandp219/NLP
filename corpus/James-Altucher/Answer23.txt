 geographic locations, etc. The connections Johnson makes are brilliant. For instance, The Gutenberg Press (which, in itself, was invented because of improvements in sewing looms), made everyone realize they had bad vision. So the science of lenses was created. So microscopes were eventually created. So germs were eventually discovered. So modern medical science was discovered. And so on. Johnson is a thinker and a linker and tells a good story. "Man's Search for Meaning" by Victor FranklI'm at a loss for words here. Just read it. Don't read it for the holocaust. Or psychological theory. Read it because when you're about halfway through you will realize your life is no longer the same. "Born Standing Up" by Steve MartinAnd while you are at it, throw in "Bounce" by Mathew Syed, who was the UK Ping Pong champion when he was younger. I love any book where someone took their passion, documented it, and shared it with us. That's when you can see the subleties, the hard work, the luck, the talent, the skill, all come together to form a champion. Heck, throw in, "An Astronaut's Guide to Earth" by Commander Chris Hadfield."Zero to One" by Peter ThielThere's a lot of business books out there. 99% of them are BS. Read this one. So many concepts really changed my attitude about not only business but capitalism. Thiel, the founder of PayPal, and first investor in Facebook, is brilliant in how he simply shares his theories on building a billion dollar business. "Quiet" by Susan CainProbably half the world is introverts. Maybe more. It's not an easy life to live. You feel as if you can't move, you can't talk, you can't go into a room and spread a vision you might have. Quiet shows the reader how to unlock the secret powers that probably half the world needs to unlock. "Antifragile" by Nassim TalebAnd throw in "The Black Swan" and "Fooled by Randomness". "Fragile" means if you hit something might break. "Resilient" means if you hit something, it will stay the same. But Nassim discusses "Antifragility" - building a system, even one that works for you on a personal level, where you if you harm it in some way it becomes stronger. He discusses Antifragility throughout history, up to our current economic situation, and even in our personal situations. "Mindset" by Carol DweckAgain, I am fascinated by the field of mastery. Not self-improvement (eat well, sleep well, etc) but on how can you continue a path of improvement so that you can really enjoy the subtleties at a very deep level of whatever it is you love. Carol Dweck, through massive research and storytelling, shows the reader how to continue on the path of improvement and why so many people fall off that path. These are not books I'm picking so I can look smart. These are books that I feel have made me smarter.If I die now and I've only read these books I'm fine with that.
