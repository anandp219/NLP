 CHOOSE THEMSELVESWe know that happiness is not related to money. Countless studies have shown this.Often its related to our mindset. To the choices we make. Again, when someone asked me why not worry about tomorrow, there is no real answer. Why should I?Francis quote: This is the struggle of every person: be free or be a slave.Even if you are stuck at the bottom of solitary confinement in jail, you can still choose to be free inside your spirit.This is not self-help BS. This is your choice: do you be miserable or do you root yourself in your inner freedom? Why choose to be miserable?And yet, often when I wake up in the morning, all my past memories suck me in as quickly as possible and its an effort not to say ugh.Then I'm a slave again. Its a practice every day to choose freedom.G) HE SECRETLY READS MY EMAILSHis quote: Living together is an art. Its a patient art, its a beautiful art, its fascinating.How does he know that Claudia and I recently had a horrible argument.It was so painful. I couldnt even function for days. We dont argue a lot and when we do I feel like my heart bursts open.Do you ever feel like that? Like you argue with someone and the only way out of it is to crawl into a cave. To disappear and not even think until the storm seems to pass.But it does pass. And you figure your way through the maze to find a greater intimacy.I dont brag about it. I hate arguing. I dont ever want to. Id honestly rather have less intimacy in my life than argue to find greater intimacy.But when its there I do feel like we just made a work of art.H) HE DOESNT TEACH FEARFor all I know he is an atheist. I cant find one quote from him about hell or damnation.In my view (and I may be wrong, it doesnt matter to me) he uses the word god as a placeholder for well-being.Many studies show that the key to contentment and confidence is three things:Growing competence in a pursuit you loveStrengthening every day the relationships around youIncreasing your freedom of choices3Quote from the Pope: If we start without confidence, Already we have lost half the battle and we bury our talents.I) HE THINKS LIKE THE DALAI LAMAA friend of mine who is a believer in Tibetan Buddhism and has spent much time with the Dalai Lama once told me this: when you are with the Dalai Lama you feel as if he loves you the way a mother loves her baby.Quote from Francis: To protect every man and every woman, to look upon them with tenderness and love, is to open up a horizon of hope. It is to let a shaft of light break through the heavy clouds; it is to bring the warmth of hope!J) LIVE BY EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF PREACHINGImagine youve had a hard day at your construction site. You finally get a break, sit down with your friends, and break out your lunch.A man walks by. Hes tired also from his job. He leaves the crowd surrounding him and asks you and your friends if he can join you for lunch.He pulls out his lunchbox also and starts eating and talking to you.He lives in a simple studio, drives a simple car, and refuses all gifts anyone gives him.Hes the Pope and this happened.Quote: These two criteria are like the pillars of true love: deeds, and the gift of self.He doesnt just say it. He lives it.It doesnt matter if you are Jewish on the holiest day of the year. It doesnt matter if you are an atheist. It doesnt matter if you are Christian, or Catholic.Pope Francis lives a message. I wish every day I could try to live closer to that same message.K) HIS NAME IS HIS ENTIRE BELIEF SYSTEMHe chose the name Francis when he became Pope because of Francis of Assisi. How come?He explains:Francis of Assisi loved, helped and served the needy, the sick and the poor; he also cared greatly for creation.To me, this is the entire belief system of Pope Francis. He did not use the words god or jesus or spirit above.This is all anyone needs to transform a life of fear and stress and anxiety and regret into a life of well-being and happiness.Sometimes I think Im not a good person. Sometimes I look at people on the street and hate them for no reason. Sometimes Im not as good as I could be to family or friends.But Im trying to be better. I hope every day I can wake up and remind myself of Franciss exact words above.To care greatly for creation is the essence of choosing yourself instead of letting anyone else do it for you.Instead of being held back by judgments or anger or fear or regret.Maybe one day I will be able to live in a studio, call people who need help, eat lunch with strangers, take selfies with whoever.For now, I write blog posts. And maybe tomorrow Ill die.Read More: How To Live ForeverHow to be THE LUCKIEST GUY ON THE PLANET in 4 Easy Steps
