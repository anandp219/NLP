 I have quite a number of friends at Yelp, both in management and ex MS students who went there after graduation. It's really hard to say. Right now on September 14, 2015 I would not buy much stock in any company. I would wait for the fed reserve decision on interest rates on Thursday. After that, I don't know. I would probably say that it's cheap compared to its own historical valuation. I've long believed in the company as well as their barrier to entry in that sector. But they've had a lot of bad luck and bad sentiment. I would probably wait for the share price to show a clear bottom before buying in. Meanwhile, there are safer (but more expensive) growth stocks in tech/social, FB, LNKD. Twitter is another stock that's hit hard times, but looks like it's already hit bottom.
