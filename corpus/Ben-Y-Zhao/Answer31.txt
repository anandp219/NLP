 Do what interests you!Everyone is different. You're early enough in the game that you should focus on really fostering and building that interest and passion. Whatever it is that got you interested, I suggest doing much much more of the same. Is it robotics, or AI, or virtual reality, networking, security, or social networks? Whatever you're the most interested in, study and develop those interests as much as you can. On the way, study related topics that help you go further. You have college classes to help you fill in the gaps. But for now, go as deep as you can into what drives your passion...
