 You don't. In the end, the only race is the one you have with yourself. When you're in the later stages of your life, as you look back on the footprint you've left, you will not be comforted by the number of hours and sleepless nights you spend trying to outdo your peers. It will not bring you short term or long term happiness. You'll likely regret the time and hours taken away from your family and friends. My suggestion: become comfortable with who you are. If you want to accomplish more to make yourself better, for your family etc, then do it. But don't do it for others, peers or not. No matter how much you try and how much you sacrifice, you will always meet people better and more accomplished than yourself. Remember that real "world changers" don't use their peers as measuring sticks. If they did, Gates, Jobs, and others would have stopped long before making their real impact in the world.
