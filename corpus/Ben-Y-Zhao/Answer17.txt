 Graduate applications are all about distinguishing your application from the hundreds of others in the same application pool. My thoughts:1. abstract algebra and analysis are not likely to help you that much in ML. Linear algebra yes, statistics, probability theory, and many others will. But it sounds like retaking those courses are solely about improving grades in a couple of courses.2. Coursework and GPA is often used as a minimum bar, and often acts that way, i.e. you will be grouped with a large group of candidates who have similar GPAs. Unless your grades are spectacular, it is difficult to stand out using GPAs alone.3. Given that your grades are already non-ideal, I would give up on trying to distinguish yourself using grades. Instead, focus on research. On that front, I am highly skeptical that you can get 1-2 papers in that short of a time frame. But it is likely that you can at least get deeply involved into a project, and with some luck, get a submission and a good letter of recommendation from the faculty PI. That alone *might* serve to distinguish yourself from the hundreds of other applicants in the pool...
