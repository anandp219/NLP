 I don't quite understand the premise. In the absence of mitigating circumstances, I think it's incredibly shortsighted.If you're going to undertake a 5-6 year PhD, you're going to be paid a stipend that will likely average 1500-2000 USD/month. Out of that, it should not be difficult to save at least 200-300/month. Compared to this, your average PhD application costs somewhere between 60 and 100 USD? So if you have zero $, and you borrow from your friends/family the $ you need to apply to 7-8 schools, you should still be able to pay them all back in 3-4 months, and possibly sooner.So the cost/benefit analysis here doesn't work. You can either save $800 and take on the HIGHLY probable scenario where your 1 school does not accept you, or the even more likely scenario that even if that school does accept you, it is not the best school you could have gotten into. That's just simple probability. Either way, the cost in the future quality of life (not to mention the difference in potential future earnings) is immeasurable. My advice, do whatever it is that you have to do to get the $ for your applications. Having one more application might mean you get into a substantially better graduate program and hundreds of thousands (or even millions) more in future salary.Emailing professors is useless. In all likelihood those emails will generate very few responses, if any.
