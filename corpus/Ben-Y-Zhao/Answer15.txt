 Not sure what type of questions you have in mind... but I guess it's possible.We tend to interview many of our PhD applicants (I've tried to institute an informal policy that tries to make sure every eventual admit is interviewed before the final decision is made).I don't know whether any hesitation is significant enough to be a "red flag." Everyone reacts to questions differently, whether they be personal or technical. Offhand, I can't think of a question that would require a "non-hesitation" response. Perhaps something basic like "do you want to come to our department?"
