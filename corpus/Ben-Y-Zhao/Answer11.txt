 I'm sorry to say that in my opinion your chances, even with ok TOEFL/GRE scores, are not going to be very good for Berkeley.Most PhD departments batch students by quality of their undergrad school. Schools from China outside of the top 10 or 20 will have a very difficult path in to the short list at top departments. Berkeley has the additional luxury that they get all the top domestic US candidates in their application pool. So there is zero need to take high risks beyond the absolute top students in China.Regarding the papers, all that matters is the quality of the venue. Number of conference papers doesn't matter if the quality is poor. If it's a top tier paper, e.g. SIGCOMM/MOBICOM/NSDI/PLDI/CCS/STOC/ISCA, then just 1 will get you a very close look.
