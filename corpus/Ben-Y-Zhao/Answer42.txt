 LOL. Come on Jessica, you know full well academics find ways to get what they need.Yes, it's true that letters written for us are meant to be confidential. But that's not alway the case. When you become a faculty member, you get redacted versions of the letters that got you hired.But that's not all. As a faculty member, you get to see lots of letters of recommendations. Letters for graduate admissions, letters for faculty applications, letters for promotion to tenure. Pretty soon, you learn to recognize different styles of writing letters, what's useful to include, what's horrible to omit, how to make a convincing and objective point, etc. It's just like learning to write good papers from reading other papers, except the sample set is smaller, and there are less nuances to master. Pretty soon, if you pay attention, you know how to write a decent/good letter of recommendation.
