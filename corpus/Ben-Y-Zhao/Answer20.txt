 Sometimes you have a crappy day and it's just best to get it over with. Go to bed and everything will be a little brighter when you wake up, and the pain you feel from the exam will be a little duller. And if nothing else, waking up the next day proves that the world did not end simply because you did poorly on an exam. Try to remember that everyone fails sooner or later. And many have said in some form or another, we are not defined by our failures, only the failures that we do not get up from.
