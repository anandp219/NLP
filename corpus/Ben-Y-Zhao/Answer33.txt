 Everyone has said something truly stupid once upon a time.The real question is how often does something like this happen? If it's a pattern, then you have a problem. He's creating an atmosphere that is making you uncomfortable.

If it happens again, I would definitely mention it to him, that jokes like these make you uncomfortable and you'd like them to stop. If it continues, then see paragraph 1 above.
