 Crypto and security are both very strong at UCSB. By "Security" i.e non crypto security, you have Giovanni and Chris (and me on occasion).

They're a really strong dynamic duo, and have that unique energy that new assistant professors have.I think more importantly, you should worry about getting in first.
