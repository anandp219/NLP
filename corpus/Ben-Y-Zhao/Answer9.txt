 First, in computer science, most of the selective venues are conferences, partially because of the longer turnaround time for journals. That said, there's little point trying to quantify average publication rate per student, because the venue and selectivity of the paper is a much more important factor in its value and impact. Two or three mobicom papers (especially if it's an important area) might be enough to get you a faculty job. Dina Katabi got offers from basically every top cs program in 2002(?) on the basis of two sigcomm papers. So if trying to quantify student productivity is poorly done using number of papers, trying to do so two years in is even less useful. Students will start publishing papers at different rates depending on project type, learning curve, level of background necessary, level of advisor involvement, and of course the productivity of the student. But so many factors make trying to quantify this useless.
