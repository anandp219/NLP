 It depends, but generally no. We're happy to write them, because it's part of our responsibility as professors.I think I'm in the majority when I say that I enjoy writing letters for students who I know well and want to support. Students who have interacted with me substantially will get very detailed letters. For me, that's a core and very important part of my job. And writing letters for students who I enjoy working with is an actual pleasure. The other side is the student who comes in and asks for a letter when they've have near zero interactions with me. Even if they've done well and gotten an A, it's hard to write a substantive letter without knowing the student beyond a face in the classroom. If the student meets with me and talks to me in depth, that helps. Otherwise writing the letter will be difficult, because I need to think hard about something useful I can mention in the letter. So if you don't know the professor well, then be sure to meet with him/her before the letter needs to be written.
