 Simple, because people demand it.Those people are the parents of students who want guidance in where their students should apply. They also need metrics for success, so they can quantify the quality of the institutions their kids are attending.Rankings serve a purpose in that they are effectively a centralized repository for global reputations of universities. So anyone can check and see what is the "consensus reputation" for a given university. Of course that serves as a self-fulfilling prophecy: the better the reputation, the better the applicants and the better students who attend; that produces higher quality and more successful alumni, who donate more $ back to their alma mater, adding to their resources and improving the quality of teaching, faculty, and physical infrastructures and resources.Hence a massive self-reinforcing loop that makes good schools better, and rich schools richer.
