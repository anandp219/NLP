 My answer would be complacency.Success is rarely binary, but almost always a sliding scale from utter failure to overwhelming world shaking success. We all have inner battles that rage within us, often silently, between expending the energy and will to move one step up the success scale, and the relief that comes from accepting your current place in the world as "good enough."Success is also relative. No matter how good you become (by some metric of success), there will always be people who are more successful on the same metric. They are the people who chose not to accept your level of success as good enough.
