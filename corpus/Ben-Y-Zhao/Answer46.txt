 Answering this question is rather awkward.Nobody should try to be "like" me. Everyone is a product of their experiences and decisions. While I've had my share of bumps in the road, I've been also very fortunate at key points in my life. There's no point (or benefit) to trying to emulate what I've done.Everyone is different, and there are countless ways to succeed. I have friends from high school, college, and graduate school who have been far more successful than me on a variety of different metrics. Some have wonderful families and work everyday by helping people in need. Others are professors, scholars, SVPs at large financial institutions, and roles with significant political and economic influence. They just don't happen to be on Quora right now.My suggestion:1. Define your success metric. Really figure out what you want in life. Is it $, family, fame, recognition of your peers? If you don't know what you really want, it's going to be harder to find it.2. Be fearless. A couple of those unfortunate bumps early on almost cost me everything. Getting past them gave me a new perspective on life. I felt like I had nothing to lose, and that allowed me to take risks others have shied away from. Hopefully you can overcome fear without facing the adversity I did.3. Finding success is sometimes just recognizing your own strengths instead of forcing yourself to be something you're not. I've always been interested in finance and economics going back to high school, but it wasn't until graduate school that I realized I could indulge in it while serving a useful purposes of managing investments.
