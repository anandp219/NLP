 Of course you can. Any decent cs program will have sufficient breadth to cover these areas. If you're aiming at some of the top programs you should have no problems. Many people switch areas during their PhD, and do quite well afterwards. I entered Berkeley as a programming languages student, disappointed my PL faculty advisors by declaring interest in systems in year 1, and ended up graduating with papers and results more centered in networking and algorithms than OS. It's ok. Faculty have seen this happen again and again and will not be upset when you change areas.
