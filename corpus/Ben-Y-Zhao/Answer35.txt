 Why bother asking these questions?The simplest way to determine if you've got what it takes, is to try it! You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain. Who cares if you didn't get publications during your MS? If there's someone who you would consider to be a great PhD advisor, willing to take you on, then TAKE the offer! If you can't handle it, then leave. No big loss. At the very least, you've answered the question and probably put yourself to a real test. That'll be good for you. If you don't try, then no matter how well you do later, you'll always wonder "what if."Most/all of us don't really find out what we're truly capable of until we're put into tough situations that bring out the best in us. If you don't take the risk, then you'll never find out just how good you could be.
