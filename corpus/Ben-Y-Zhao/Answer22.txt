 If your top reason for getting a phd is so that you would "have a PhD", I think you should get a masters. Getting s PhD is hard enough without being sick of the department to start with. That discontent will only magnify every time something doesn't go well. Probably better to save yourself the anguish and time.But before you make any big decisions like this, I would suggest consulting with others who know your situation well. Their opinions are likely much more well informed than anyone reading your question on Quora.
