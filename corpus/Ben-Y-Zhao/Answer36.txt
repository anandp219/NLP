 This sounds like a very reasonable question.If you're honest and correct in your self-assessment, then the answer is fairly simple: you need a more challenging career. There are two ways to solve the problem.1. Some people see their job as just that, a "job" they perform to earn money to do the fun things that fulfill them and give them meaning. If you work for money so that you can travel, live a certain lifestyle, etc, then this is you. If that's the case, then you just need to recognize your job as a job, and find your challenges and fulfillment elsewhere. In that case, you should take advantage of the fact that your job is easy. Find and explore new challenging hobbies (try financial investments, or get deep into photography or cooking). Do what you need to do to succeed in your job, and use all your extra time to become an expert in your hobbies.2. If you're the type of person who is mainly defined by their career and their success in their career, then you're likely to seek fulfillment and self-affirmation through work. If that's the case for you, then the solution is simple, you need a more challenging career. Find a line of work that thrills you, the kind of job that you wake up early for without an alarm. Do what you have to do to switch into that career, and then pour your time into it. It'll be rewarding in the way that your current job is not.
