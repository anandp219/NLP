 The same way you would hope to live a fulfilling life if you failed a class in elementary school.Life is long, and GPAs are short.But a more serious (longer) answer:Step #1: Take other people out of the equation for your self-worth and success. Strive as much as you can to take full responsibility for your own successes/failures, regardless of how difficult the circumstances. Failure to do so puts you (and your mental view of yourself) at the mercy of the world around you. Step #2:Get better in math. Even though your aspirations today will likely have little correlation to your actual future career, math is pervasive, and getting good command of mathematics is a critical tool that will at least avoid putting you at a disadvantage, and possibly give you a huge leg up against competitors for the same job/career.
