 Yes, Albert Einstein, and many of his direct descendants, played the violin. Einstein was passionate about the violin, and though Einstein often had a distant and strained relationship with his family, he shared a love music, and left his violin as a legacy.Einstein's remarkable talent was for physics, but he played the violin throughout his life, and he was a good musician with an intuitive understanding of the music. Playing the violin brought him happiness, and he bequeathed his last violin (said to be nicknamed Lina), to his grandson, Bernhard Caesar Einstein. Bernhard Caesar, also became a physicist and shared Albert's ability to play the violin. Bernhard Caeser's second son, Paul Michael Einstein, also inherited the love of playing and Bernhard Caesar gave him Albert's violin. Today Paul Michael lives in the South of France, where he is a professional composer and violinist. In 2004, Paul Michael performed Mozarts Sonata in E Minor, Alberts favorite piece, at the German Physical Societys celebration of Albert Einsteins 125th birthday. All of Einstein's descendants didn't inherit Einstein's IQ, but many of them did inherit his love of music and ability to play the violin. And, studies have indicated that Musicians Are Probably Smarter Than The Rest Of Us.
