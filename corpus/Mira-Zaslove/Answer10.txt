 Who won the debate? Depends who you ask. The winner is either Clinton or Sanders. Like the election itself, O'Malley, Web, and Chafee are not in the running. Unlike the Republican Primary race, the Democratic Primary race is clearly between 2 people. I watched the debate, and thought both Clinton and Sanders performed well, and further solidified their base. As the graphic below shows, reviews on who won are mixed. But interestingly, they are mixed in a pretty similar way: Editors largely believed Clinton was the clear and decisive winner, whereas viewer polls on these same sites, largely believed Sanders won by a significant margin.(Source: Facebook) Sanders also picked up a lot of Google traffic, as compared to Clinton. However, I don't view that as meaningful. Hillary Clinton is one of the most recognizable people in America, and she's effectively been running for President for the last decade. We already know all about her husband, her business ventures, and her e-mail servers. Very few people probably feel the need to Google her much anymore.
