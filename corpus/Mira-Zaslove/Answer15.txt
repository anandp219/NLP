 The strangest thing I ever saw at airport security was at the Antonio Rivera Rodrguez Airport, in the Isla de Vieques, Puerto Rico. It was the first, and only time, I've ever seen a pet adoption at a security check point at the airport. The Vieques airport is tiny. It flies mostly small local airlines, offering flights to San Juan. The attitude at the airport is informal and friendly. And at airport security, there was an adorably friendly stray puppy running around. The puppy lived at the airport. He was small, but looked reasonably healthy, and well cared for-- he was well fed by tourists at the security check in. He even had a hat and some clothes on. A woman in our line, took it a step further. She took a liking to the puppy, and actually put him in her purse and began walking to her flight! The security folks reluctantly let her.I'm not sure if she was able to take the puppy on the small plane to San Juan, but I really wouldn't have been surprised.
