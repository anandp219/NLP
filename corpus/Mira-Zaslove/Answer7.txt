 It's perfectly acceptable and correct to write either. People will know what you are trying to say. The goal in professional communication is to be understood. "Please find the attached file," is more common, but not the only correct phrase. For example, if adding additional text, like: "you requested," it would sound more natural to use the later, "Please find attached the file you requested." It's always good to remove unnecesary words, so when in doubt cut "the" and just write, "please find attached" or PFA. "Attached" is the correct word for e-mail & electronic communication. Enclosed, is more frequently associated with physical mail. Finally, "find" has more than one meaning, and using it doesn't necessarily mean that something is lost. "Please find attached" is letting the reader know that something is attached in the email. And yes, this can be necessary, as some people really do miss that little paperclip icon denoting an attachment.
