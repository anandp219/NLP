 especially in tech and in Silicon Valley.Now for the harder part that actually may impact your job prospects: navigating the immigration process. Visa issues can prohibit opportunity and limit job prospects. The US distributes visas by lottery, and the number of H-1B is capped by Congress. The process is complicated and limiting. Once you graduate from your MS program, and are looking for a job, you will need your employer to sponsor your H-1B visa. If they want to hire you, it won't typically be a problem. Especially in the Bay Area. However, the company does have to pay additional money (approx $2-5K) and generally make the case that you have specialized skills that an American doesn't. If you are on H-1B visa and want to move to another job, again you will need the new company to transfer your visa. Not every company will do it, and this could limit your prospects. Smaller companies and new start-ups aren't always as familiar and comfortable with the process, and may not sponsor you. Many Indians are therefore more conservative with their jobs and careers. They gravitate towards, and stay longer, at safer jobs, because they can't afford to take as much risk. If an Indian gets laid off, or the company they work for goes bust, they will need to quickly find another employment sponsor. If they can't, they have to go back to India. Americans can take a risky job, without worrying about deportation. Similarly companies that have just gone through big lay-offs often can't or won't sponsor H-1b visas during that time. So companies like these, going through transition and tough times-- which ironically are often very good for career growth and opportunity-- can be off limits for those on work visas. Once you get your H-1B visa, you will need to ask your employer to sponsor your green card (GC). Good companies will do this for you. However, once the GC process starts, it takes some time, and is complicated, with many steps. Yo have no control over how quickly it will get done. And switching companies while you are in the process of getting your GC can be scary, so many Indian engineers generally stay with the same company until they get the GC-- which can take up to 7-8 years. Once you fianlly have your GC, then you are a free bird and can move around. There won't really be any issues with your job prospects or types of companies ready to hire you. Americans generally consider Indians to be great engineers because Indian technical schools are believed to be just as good, or better, than those in the US. Indians particularly dominate in engineering. However, you will need to prove your worth, just like everyone else. Ultimately, your skills and some luck, rather than your skin color, will be the determining factors of your job prospects.
