 If someone accosts you in a secluded area, and asks you to give them your money, give them what they want, and get out of the situation as fast as possible. If the person is truly only after the money, they will focus on the money and give you a chance to escape.In these cases, your goal is to stay safe, not to risk your life over a few hundred dollars. Most ATM's have transaction limits, so the thief is after a quick "grab and go" rather than a big score. They don't want to bring attention to themselves or cause too much trouble. It isn't worth it for them.Get away as fast as you can. Don't try to fight. And absolutely do not get into their car. Stay in the open and run as fast as you can towards public places. It's much better for the thief to be suspicious, than for you to be robbed, or in danger. So if you think someone is a thief, run. Cancel your transaction mid-stream, if you have to, and get out of there. Even if your ATM card is in the machine. You can always call the bank to cancel the card, once you are in the clear. Again, your goal is always safety, not holding onto your ATM card or money. Most ATMs have video cameras, so if they start to attack you, point at the camera to distract them, and run. Remain calm and confident. If you frequently go to unsafe areas, and know of people getting mugged in your area, have a decoy "muggers" wallet, with only a small amount of real money and outdated / old credit cards. If you are accosted, hand over the decoy wallet, to satisfy the thief, and get out of the situation quickly. The best way to stay safe, is to exercise preventative measures, and try not to be alone at a secluded ATM. Whenever possible:Go to the ATM during the day, preferably during relatively busy timesUse popular ATMs in well trafficked areas that you are familiar withIf you need an ATM at night, go to a grocery store, buy something small, and get cash backBring someone with you Be as fast and efficient as possibleDon't count your cash in publicDon't get a receipt to check your balance -- do it online or inside the bank branch insteadPut your cash and ATM card away immediatelyDon't listen to earphones, make a phone call, text, or look at your phoneRemain alert and mind your own business
