 There are a few times when ruthlessness is the best course of action.ruthless (roothls)adj.Having no compassion or pity; merciless: ruthless cruelty; ruthless opportunism. 1. When someone is out to harm you, or your company, be ruthless. Whether it be a competitor, a colleague, an employee. If you are dealing with someone who is a bad faith negotiator, and is looking to hurt you, then you have to protect yourself by whatever means necessary. Contrary to what some people believe, it's not necessary to start out with this attitude. Many of the most brutal and ruthless people start out kind, and compassionate until someone gives them a reason to distrust. In the words of Al Capone:Don't mistake my kindness for weakness. I am kind to everyone, but when someone is unkind to me, weak is not what you are going to remember about me. When you are dealing with someone who doesn't have your best interest in mind, be ruthless in defending against attack. Be careful though not to be vindictive or petty. Protect yourself and move on. It doesn't do any good to hold onto silly or meaningless grudges. 2. When you are dealing with someone who doesn't respond to anything else.There are people who don't respond to anything less. I've dealt with these types of people, and tried to reason with them, and tried to be nice. Compassion did not work. The nicer and more reasonable I was, the more they took advantage of me, and worse, continued to think they could trample all over me. These people will respect you only when you are ruthless. To them, compassion looks like weakness and they only respond to unbridled shows of strength. So give it to them. 3. When you have waged war, and are all in. There are times in business, and battles when it is more compassionate to be ruthless. If a company is in a massive death spiral or something drastic needs to be done, it is best to be ruthless and do it quickly. One of the Maxims of Napoleon Bonaparte: "If you wage war, do it energetically and with severity. This is the only way to make it shorter and consequently less inhuman."In these times of crisis, it's necessary to be ruthless in the productive sense. Work when others sleep, be ruthless in winning. It's not necessary, or healthy, to always be at war. Balance, compassion, and sleep are a good thing. However, once war is upon you, be ruthless to end it quickly and in your favor.
