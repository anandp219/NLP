 The Parents' Club of Palo Alto & Menlo Park (PAMP) is an awesome online community for Parents in Silicon Valley. http://pampclub.org/site/ PAMP is volunteer-led and non-profit. PAMP has been around for almost 25 years and has membership of around 2,000 parents in Silicon Valley. I found our Nanny on PAMP, and have used PAMP as a good resource for activities, for both Mom's & Dad's, in Silicon Valley. PAMP is a great community resource for things like the following:Events: PAMP organizes both large and small community events. For example, I'm looking forward to an upcoming Fun at the Farm Day at Pastorino Farms which will have pony rides, a petting zoo, hay rides, train rides, and bouncy houses. PAMP also has "Dad's Playtime in the Park" events. Exclusive Discounts: Deals from 70 stores, including things for Mom, like SoulCycle and a waxing bar: The Parents' Club of Palo Alto and Menlo Parkdiscounts/#Complete Discount Directory. A few PAMP Mom's are photographers and offer discounts for members. Kids Activities: Discounted classes and events for babies, toddlers and preschoolers. Activities include Swim Classes, Petting Zoos and some Pre-Schools.Online Content & User Friendly App: PAMP has a great website and newsletter. They also have a user-friendly App.Online Forum: I'm a member of a few forums and they are great. As mentioned, "The Domestic Help" forum is awesome. I found my nanny there -- its probably the best resource for information on Domestic help in the area. Recommendations: Scrolling through the App this morning, I see Mom's asking for and giving recommendations for a great variety of things like: face painting, sleep experts, toddler bicycle seats, and where to donate old clothes.
