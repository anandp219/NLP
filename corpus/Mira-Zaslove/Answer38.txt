 Power is dangerous in the Game of Thrones. As Cersei Lannister reminds Ned Stark during their final confrontation:"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground." Jon Snow, by becoming the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch, put himself in a position of power, a precarious position in Game of Thrones. Jeor Mormont, the 997th Lord Commander of the Nights Watch, who led the Great Ranging was also betrayed and killed by his own men in the mutiny at Craster's Keep. Aerys II Targaryen was also infamously betrayed and killed by a member of his Kingsguard, Jaime Lannister -- The Kingslayer -- during the Sack of King's Landing.Anyone in power needs to constantly watch their back, even around their own men. Jon Snow failed to do that, and paid the price. Alliser Thorne, never really liked Jon Snow and was waiting for his chance. Ostensibly Jons people betrayed and killed him because Jon was seen to be making peace with the Wildlings, the sworn enemy of the men in Castle Black. Yet, Martin likely has more important reasons behind Jon Snows betrayal. Jon is not dead. He will be back, and will play a critical role in the war against the White Walkers. The Iron Islands credo applies : What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger. To this point Jon has been a little too trusting and incautious. After this betrayal, by his own men, Jon will come back stronger and less naive.The time has come for Jon to learn of his parentage and to fulfill his destiny. And to do that, he needs to leave the Nights Watch. It is no coincidence that Melisandre is on her way. The Lord of Light is likely about to help to resurrect the dead.
