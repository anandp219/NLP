 Liberals and conservatives disagree about a lot of things. However, when ranking the "worst presidents," they show a striking degree of consensus. For example, in the Murray-Blessing survey, a famous Historical ranking of Presidents, liberal and conservative historians agreed on 6 of the 7 worst Presidents. Warren G.Harding, Ulysses S. Grant, and Richard Nixon are often considered failed Presidents, because of massive corruption in their administrations.Warren G. Harding's name is inextricably linked with Teapot Dome scandal, just as Richard Nixon's is with Watergate. Yet, Richard Nixon's legacy is more mixed than an other US president on the "worst list." Nixon is considered bad by both parties, but liberals tend to view him as worse than conservatives. Richard Nixon was the first American president to visit communist China and he is given credit for opening relations with what is today, America's most important trade partner. Surprisingly, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) were also created on Nixon's watch. The Presidents before and after Abraham Lincoln are also both considered monumental failures by liberals and conservatives. They were the wrong men, at the wrong time and were unable to rise to the Presidential occasion.James Buchanan did nothing to save the Union and his pathetic response to secession and the crisis preceding the Civil War are "deemed the greatest single failure of any American President" by many historians, including Kenneth C. Davis. Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House of Representatives, and Reconstruction was held back under his leadership. Jimmy Carter's legacy is more split among political party lines. Liberals generally give Carter more credit for the Middle East Peace Agreement, while conservatives consider him a failure for the Iran hostage situation, and the energy crisis.
