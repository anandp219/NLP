The IRS publishes data on Americans in the "Top 400 Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) from 1992-2012. The average person in this group reported $335 Million to the IRS for AGI in 2012. On average:Salaries and wages: $32 MillionIncome from partnerships and corporations: $84 MillionCapital gains, subject to preferential rates: $230 Million(full report: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/1...)So, the really rich get their money largely through capital gains, profit resulting from a sale of a capital asset -- such as stock, or real estate. The World's Billionaires by Forbes magazine ranks the richest people in the world and none of the top 10 can really be said to work for someone else.
