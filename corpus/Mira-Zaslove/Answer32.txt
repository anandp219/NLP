 I've had this happen to me a few times in my life, and usually the person I kept seeing in my dreams, signified something larger in my life. The person you keep seeing in your dreams, may also represent something more in your life. Sometimes it can be as simple as dreaming about someone you think about during the day, but often the people you see in your dreams can also represent subconscious desires and thoughts. Psychologist Carl Jung believed that dreams acted as a window into the unconscious mind. According to Jung, dreams can present "a spontaneous self portrayal, in symbolic form, of the actual situation in the unconscious." (www.dreamresearch.ca)For example, when I was going through a career shift, I thought a lot about work, and other people who I thought were more successful than me. I was subconsciously envious of some of my friends, who I thought had it all figured out. And during that time, one of my friends, a successful entrepreneur, often showed up in my dreams. However, now that I have a new job and am not obsessing so much about finding "the perfect career" (especially before I go to bed), this person has completely vanished from dreams. Similarly, when I really wanted to get a promotion at work -- but hadn't yet articulated the desire to myself or others-- I had a few dreams where I kept seeing my boss. Nobody wants to dream about their boss (especially me)... but during that time my boss kept coming into my dreams. I was thinking a lot about how much I deserved a promotion. Yet, I was nervous to ask for it, and hadn't really admitted to myself how much I really wanted it. Subconsciously, at night, however my mind was still getting comfortable with the idea and gaining the courage to act. Thankfully, after I got the promotion, my boss stayed out of my dreams. So, a recurring person who keeps showing up in your dreams could reflect a feeling or desire that has not been successfully resolved in your waking "real" life. Unresolved feelings are uncomfortable and we tend to replay them in our subconscious minds. People you see in your dreams can also signify the future and something you are excited about. Jung believed dreams can provide prospective images of the future. For example, when I first got pregnant, I had a few vivid dreams of a baby. Perhaps this person you keep seeing will have a part to play in your future? So, if someone keeps showing up in your dreams, take a look at where you are in the current phase of your life, and take a look at what this person signifies to you. Do they always make you feel a certain way? What was going on in your life when you first met them? Is there a time you always see this person? The person you keep seeing in your dream could be a signal. Is there something in your life that they signify? If so, interpret the dream and act.
