 Most of the characters on the Walking Dead (TWD) are badasses to have survived this long. Sure there are some non-badasses, like Father Gabriel, but our group is solid. Carol, Michonne, and Daryl are major badasses. And so are Maggie and Glen. In the midst of the apocalypse, I would trust any one of them with my life. But the biggest badass on TWD has got to be our main man, Rick Grimes. (Source: The Walking Dead, Rick Grimes)Rick is the leader, and ultimate badass among badasses. He is alert, loyal, and brutal. Rick does what needs to be done to survive. Not only has Rick survived, but he has also kept his son, and his daughter alive. He is a single father, taking care of a baby and a teenage son -- which makes him a pretty big ass-kicker by itself. Not to mention, fighting off hoards of walkers, wolves, and deprived humans who want to kill him, and his group, at every step. Anyone who has tried to take care of a baby in the best of circumstances, knows how loud, hungry, and utterly dependent they are. Sure, Rick has had plenty of help taking care of his kids -- which only further shows how much of a badass he is. Rick is capable with a gun, a knife, and oh yeah, in the Season 4 finale, he literally tore open a mans throat with his teeth.
