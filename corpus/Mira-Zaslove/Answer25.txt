 Want to get some insight into whether that crazy someone is, in fact, a psychopath? Try this quick psychological trick: yawn and see if they yawn back.People with Psychopathic Traits Are Less Likely to Catch a Contagious Yawn than Empathetic Folks, Study FindsBrian Rundle, behavioral scientist at Baylor University, makes the case that contagious yawning is an innate form of empathetic communication. It isnt just coincidence, or lack of caffeine, when you yawn in a morning meeting when you see your co-worker yawning across the room. Yawning when others yawn, appears to be linked to a person's degree of empathy -- the ability to understand and connect with the emotional states of others. Contagious yawning turns out to be pretty common, it has even been found in other social species, including chimpanzees and dogs.However, according to Rundle, some people aren't as likely to catch a yawn. Those least likely to yawn, when you do? People high in psychopathic personality traits. One reason? They aren't that empathetic. According to Rundle's Research: "Psychopathy is characterized by an antisocial lifestyle, including being selfish, manipulative, impulsive, fearless, domineering and, in particular, lacking in empathy."Properly diagnosing a psychopath is obviously more complicated than just watching to see if they catch your contagious yawn, but next time you are questioning whether your new boss or new date is as psychopathic as they seem, try this quick psychological trick.
