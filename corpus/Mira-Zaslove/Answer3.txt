 Many amazing lines from The Matrix, including: Neo: What are you trying to tell me? That I can dodge bullets? Morpheus: No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to. ***Trinity: Neo... nobody has ever done this before. Neo: I know. That's why it's going to work. ***Morpheus: There is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path. Morpheus: This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.***Neo: I want my phone call.Agent Smith: Tell me Mr. Anderson, what good is a phone call if you are unable to speak?
