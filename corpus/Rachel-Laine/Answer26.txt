 The need for more than a simple polite apology usually arises after an emotionally charged event. While most of us go on autopilot and remember without conscious thought that it's appropriate to apologize after you bump into someone accidentally or spill something, it's really difficult to access that same mental cheat sheet and gain perspective in the hours or days immediately following a highly charged emotional tussle. It is important to be acutely aware that when you are in the thick of it your judgment is clouded by your pride and fear and the sting of things that were said and not said. When the dust is just starting to settle on the battlefield, try thinking about what you want out of the relationship and what your long term goals are for the relationship. Don't focus on whether or not you are sorry that you said that Janet's mother nags too much. Examining your relationship as a whole often has the ancillary benefit of improving your perspective on the event. Do you really want to draw a line in the sand (or set up a fort on the sofa) over x? How important is this? Maybe a lot, but maybe not so much.Sometimes apologies aren't about us and our rightness or personal sense of justice. In the give and take of a relationship, occasionally an apology will be just about the other person's needs and that's okay. Apologies help people to save face and that's important. When we love and respect people, helping them to save face and saving face ourselves is part of the relationship tango. This is part of the idea behind an "act of contrition". Being contrite isn't necessarily *always* about being woefully and excessively ashamed of what you have said or done, but about understanding and caring for your partner's needs and the needs of the relationship. If you can find something genuine to apologize for that is ideal, of course, but think of the bigger picture too.
