 Dating is rough, isn't it? The women that I know invest a lot in an evening out with a man, even if they don't pay the dinner tab at the end of the evening. Dates are such a big investment of time, money, and emotional energy that I don't know a single person who would accept a dinner invitation simply for the gratis overcooked steak. The women I know would be more than happy to stay home and eat leftovers in sweatpants rather than spend a terrible evening with Mr. Wrong.You know how nice women look on dates? That pretty dress, those heels, her hair styled just so? This all takes time, money, and effort. When I was younger my friends and I would help each other get ready for dates. We weren't saying to one another, "This is the date that you said yes to for the food, right? Are you going to order the lobster?" We were asking about her feelings for the guy. What he was like. How the date had been set up. How she had been feeling since her date with Mr. Chews With Open Mouth. Even though you are only saying "yes" to sharing a few hours together, the emotional investment and potential messiness are worth a whole lot more than her 12 dollar tilapia entree. Ignoring the energy invested in presenting your best self and opening yourself up to a new person, rejecting someone is actually a very difficult and stressful thing to do. While it's not necessarily the best choice, your dates might ignore your texts because it's a lot easier than telling you that they didn't enjoy your company enough to want more of it - even another piece of that coveted free tilapia. It's an extremely difficult thing to do, but try thinking about why these women might not have connected with you enough to accept your offer for a second date. Do you not make a great first impression? If not, why? Really think about what it would be like to go out on a date with you. Good luck!
