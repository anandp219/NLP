 People from all walks of life and all tax brackets love to hate on Black Friday. The Black Friday hate parade isn't made up only of the upper classes or the 1 percenters, and the Black Friday sales aren't enjoyed only by the economically less-advantaged. To the contrary, statistics show that the sales-seekers are from a pretty equal distribution of income brackets. Outrage about Black Friday is not a form of classism, it's a type of elitism akin to hating on suburbs or the "I'm too good to own a television" crew. It says, "I'm above the masses and their disgusting, unenlightened consumerist ways that have harmful effects." So, no, not classist. Elitist.
