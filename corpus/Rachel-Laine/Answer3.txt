 Absolutely. I definitely qualify as an introvert and I worked in both in-house and agency public relations. As with most jobs, there were parts of my job that I loved and parts of my job that I was less enthusiastic about. I loved writing press releases and drafting pitches and doing research. I was less enthusiastic about making calls to editors or talking to television producers or attending cocktail parties. While I got the job done well, these calls and meetings and parties drained much more of my energy than they did for many of my extroverted coworkers who fed off of these activities like leprechauns on clover. While loving every single aspect of your job isn't a realistic requirement, I think it's important to take a careful, honest inventory of your strengths and weaknesses, what is a source of energy for you and what drains your energy, the type of environment and people you work well with, and so forth. "Communications" encompasses *a lot* of jobs. Just in PR, for example, there are very specialized jobs that focus on things like writing or media training to broader, generalist positions.
