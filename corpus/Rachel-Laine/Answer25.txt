 I am an introvert who occasionally dresses up as an extrovert. Like most things in moderation - exercise, trashy television, tourist attractions, Starbucks holiday drinks - I enjoy socializing in moderate amounts. Over the years and through some disastrous social experiences, I have learned that if I am going to continue to enjoy socializing I need to take steps to set myself up for success. For me, and I suspect for other reserved introverts out there, this means not volunteering to be part of the welcoming committee and the unofficial ice-breaking crew at parties. Bless the people who do this, but this is not a great job for reserved introverts to sign up for. If you arrive at a party at the time designated on the invitation you are, perhaps unwittingly, signing up for the welcoming committee. When you ring the doorbell at the stroke of 7pm, you are saying to your host that you are "that guy". "That guy" bellows a warm welcome to newcomers and integrates them smoothly into the conversation. He insists that they get a drink. He makes them feel welcome and special. I am great at radiating nervous energy and not so great at ice breaking antics or warmly instructing people to grab a glass of wine. No host wants me on their welcoming committee. It's much better for all involved for me to show up fashionably late after everyone has had a few of those glasses of wine and I can slink into the crowd. Most reserved introverts have cat-like crowd-slinking reflexes. No bellowing or cheek-kissing needed. Speaking of cheek-kissing, it's also in an introvert's best interest to leave before the pack if they wish to avoid the awkward obligatory hugging and child-kissing. To maximize social reward, reserved introverts often do well arriving fashionably late. While it may seem counter-intuitive, it makes it easier, not harder, to fit in.
