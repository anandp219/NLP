 Cooking for someone usually involves effort and time and love, which are all just as important as your preference for broccoli over asparagus. There are ways to diplomatically communicate your preferences to your spouse while still (genuinely, hopefully) expressing appreciation for all of their energy and effort. One approach is to be more emphatic in your praise of the dishes that you really enjoy rather than picking apart the dishes that you dislike. People tend to respond well to positive feedback and generally less well to negative feedback. Keep in mind that it's very rare that two people will have the same exact idea of what is "good" and what is "bad". This means that you might think her lasagna tastes like it came from an elementary school cafeteria, but it might be her childhood favorite. Likewise, she might think that gravy you like tastes like paste, but she makes it because you like it. This is one of those great relationship compromises.
