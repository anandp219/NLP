 I wouldn't worry overly much about this or make any changes to the list that you have already submitted and shared with your coworkers. I would move on and consider making a change next time. When I receive requests for general feedback and suggestions I keep a few things in mind: The first thing that I keep in mind is that everything is someone's job. So if I'm suggesting a change to something, it's possible that the someone who is in charge of that something will take offense. Everyone is different, but some people are quite sensitive to calls for change to things that they "own". They might feel as if you are saying to them personally, "you're doing a bad job". With this in mind, when I do offer suggestions, I do not share them with coworkers and I prefer to submit them anonymously. Let's say that I'm making a suggestion about the annual holiday party. Even if I'm not speaking directly with someone on the holiday party committee, both viruses and gossip spread pretty quickly around offices. When I give feedback I choose to limit myself to my top few suggestions because I don't want my employer or whomever it might be to mistakenly assume that I am not happy or disgruntled. While I might be a perfectly content employee with merely a lot of great ideas for improvement, if I submit an overly long list of opportunities for improvement, it's possible that my employer will incorrectly assume that I'm quite dissatisfied. Finally, I like to keep the attention span of my audience in mind. While each of your ideas might be absolutely, stunningly fabulous, it's possible that a consultant will go cross-eyed reading a really long list and your best ideas will be lost. Keeping it brief gives your best ideas the best chance.
