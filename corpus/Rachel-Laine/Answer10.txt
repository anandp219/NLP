 Dating is notoriously unfun for a reason. A person who isn't dating might look at themselves in the mirror and think, "I could probably stand to see the inside of a gym more often, but I'm not doing too badly overall." A person who is actively seeking love might glance into the mirror and never climb out because they are too busy picking out so-called flaws. That invisible wrinkle on their brow, pores that are too large, a hair or three that need to be waxed, not enough fat here or too much fat there, not enough muscle here or too much muscle there, not enough hair up top or too much hair down there -- the list is as endless as a hall of mirrors. But there is good news.It's highly likely that your potential date is suffering from this same syndrome. That she picks at her own so-called flaws and worries that her legs aren't shapely enough or that she has a bit of a muffin top or that her cheeks are a bit too round. Or maybe it's that she has too many freckles or that her hair is too wavy or too curly or that her skin isn't clear enough. Either way, why is someone else's suffering good news? How is that possible? Because it's quite likely that she isn't picking you apart in her mind at all - she's thinking about her own self-perceived flaws just like you're thinking about your own flaws. Many women are attracted to confidence, so I would spend some time practicing projecting confidence (even if you don't feel confident). Good posture is part of projecting confidence.
