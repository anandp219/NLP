 It is sort of fun to play around with the idea of what life might be like if we didn't care what other people thought about us. I might cut to the front of the coffee line to shave a cool 10 minutes off of my morning routine. Uncaffeinated people are pretty surly and unpredictable when they are angry though. Hmm... so maybe scratch that. If I'm not interested in what anyone thinks, I could dominate the conversation and only ever talk about myself and my life obsessively with friends. Do I care if they stop calling? There are a lot of ways to enjoy and exercise personal freedom in your life while still maintaining meaningful relationships and avoiding harm from not participating in societal norms. A lot of the social lubricant comes from relying on what people think of us and one could argue that it is actually selfish not to care. Not caring at all what people think of you would probably be a bit of a kamikaze mission. I'm not sure how long one could go without being jailed or beat up. An interesting experiment, maybe, but I'm not so sure that you want to volunteer to be the rat in that maze.
