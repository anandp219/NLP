 I am one of those women who accepted the traditional ring but did not take her husband's name. We spent a long time talking about rings and discussing rings before we purchased them and, likewise, we made the names decision together too. I didn't "refuse" to take his name, it was a thoughtful joint decision.I don't think that we were being hypocritical by going "cafeteria style" with our wedding choices. We chose together as a couple how we wanted our wedding and marriage to look and feel and what traditions we wanted to participate in or not. We were active participants in shaping our marriage and relationship, rather than passive observers of ancient customs. When we mindlessly observe ancient customs designed around antiquated social thought, we are both paying homage to our forebears and passing up the chance to create our own, more relevant and meaningful traditions. So what you are calling hypocrisy was, for us, about creating genuineness and meaning.
