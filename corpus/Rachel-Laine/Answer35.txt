 The essence of this question, I think, is: Do you have the right to privacy on your personal mobile phone? I suppose the answer lies in how much crime you are willing to tolerate in your society in exchange for personal liberty (in this case, a private cell phone). To take this to this to the sort of logical extreme that would make Spock blush, if we wanted to have no crime we absolutely could. It would just cost us a lot of money and some of our freedoms and almost all of our privacy. So of course, we are willing to tolerate some crime to avoid opening the door to Big Brother. We choose to have some level of crime. The government already has the ability to listen in to every phone call, text message, email, tweet, pin, Quora questions, and so on -- if they need more than that to prosecute, perhaps we either need better prosecutors or this is the intersection at which we find the level of "tolerable crime".A weaker point is the "criminals will always have guns" take. In other words, if we deny encryption to the general populace it will not prevent the use of encryption by the criminal element.
