 Have you ever imagined that your life might be a little bit better or easier in some way if you just had that something? That something that your friend has or the person in the magazine, maybe, and you imagine how wonderful their life is because of it? If you were just 10lbs thinner, you would have a much easier time attracting all of the attractive guys or girls. If you just made 10k more a year, you could live in that desirable neighborhood with the desirable people and their desirable friends. If you just had 10 more IQ points, you could go to a better college and get a better job. If you were just 10 centimeters taller, you could kill it at sports and command more respect at your job. There are countless "somethings" that people torture themselves over and women bemoaning their physical features is one more something. While almost none of the somethings that we subject ourselves to are going to make our lives more wonderful, some women might imagine that having a more petite nose, for example, might somehow make her more glamorous and her life more fabulous or that having perfect skin will make her life easier. Glancing around at the little, micro-tidbits of other people's lives that we see on social media or the carefully curated ad campaigns that we are bombarded with, it's easy to get caught up thinking that "somethings" are the cure for what ails us. We easily slip into thinking that changing our hair or our nose will change our life, just like it's easy to think that changing our popularity or bank balance will make us happy.
