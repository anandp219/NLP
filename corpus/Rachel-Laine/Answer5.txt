 It is tough to communicate to Western Quorans that driving is unnecessary because sometimes it's not unnecessary and sometimes there aren't better choices. Sometimes there are better choices, of course. I grew up in a very small, rural town in Washington state that was about an hour away from the nearest urban center. There was no public transportation. I did take the school bus to the public school and that was a 45 minute ride each way after a 1 mile walk to the bus stop. Residents relied on their cars to get to work and to retrieve groceries and other necessities.When I was in my 20's I moved to the Bay Area for a job in San Francisco. While I did have a car, I chose not to drive into work on a daily basis as it was much easier and more economical to take public transportation. I could have gotten by without a car entirely, but I am glad that I chose to have a car as it allowed me to easily take weekend trips to Napa or to the coast. A car also made little errands like getting groceries easier and more convenient. It was indeed a luxury to have a car and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I think it's a bit problematic to make a sweeping statement like "driving is unnecessary" when your audience includes very remote places with no public transportation at all and large urban centers with arguably advanced public transportation networks and more and more alternative choices like Uber and Lyft. Rather than trying to convince such a heterogeneous audience that driving is patently unnecessary, have you tried asking other probing questions so that you might better understand the motivations? Like why people might choose to live in the suburbs and spend a long time commuting rather than living in the city where they work? Or why people might choose not to carpool? Why a family might need two cars? What has stopped public transportation from being better/more efficient? Can you take a stroller on a public bus? There are a lot of layers to your problem statement.
