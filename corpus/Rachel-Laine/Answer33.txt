 You mention that things "feel incredibly jumbled". I think that this is a really great way to describe how the breakup of a relationship feels. You can feel it emotionally and physically. Almost like someone has put your insides in cement mixer. It sounds to me like you are thinking about some good things in the wake of this breakup. That's great. The people who we really care about and play an important role in our lives inevitably change us (and we them) and I don't think that this is a bad thing. You mention that you are thinking about things like the consequences of leading people on and the difference between chemistry and deeper love. You also mention that you are thinking about things like being vulnerable and physicality and where you are in life. These are all excellent things to think about and I wish that I had thought more deeply about them earlier on in my life. So how do you move on? It seems to me like you are. You are thinking about what went wrong in this relationship, about yourself and who you are, and what you might want in your next relationship/from your life and that's a pretty darn decent step in the right direction. Carry on.
