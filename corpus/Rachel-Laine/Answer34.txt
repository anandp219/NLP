 This question was a bit awkward to me (kidding, sort of...). Most people aren't social rock stars in all situations nor are they socially awkward in all situations. Have you ever met that ridiculously charismatic person at a party who just seems to float around on a rainbow of light, followed by a trail of laughter and awe? Even they are awkward in some situations. Disappointing, right?As social media and lightening fast internet and cheap air travel make our worlds bigger we are exposed to a larger cross section of people. The people you meet on Quora or Facebook might appear to you to be either profoundly socially awkward or those rainbow of light people, but sometimes aspects of these impressions are cultural and sometimes this is PR image crafting and sometimes it is just site self-selection. It's easy to think there is something in the water, but maybe the size and shape of your pond are just changing. The majority of people are neither this nor that, they are somewhere in the middle. Most of the time, however, we happen to bump into people in one narrow channel of their life which skews our perspective.
