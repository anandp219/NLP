 your man look like he stepped straight out of the pages of GQ? He might be an NSA plant or he might just have like three great "date outfits" that a friend helped him find, I don't know, but either way it's time to do some snooping. I don't generally endorse any sort of snooping in an intimate relationship, but if you are dating a programmer who dresses well, this is very serious. If your covert op turns up free tees he scored at Linux World and TSR tees and other free logo tees that he won at programming competitions or meetups of his favorite online games, then breathe a sigh of relief and never, ever, ever do that sneaky snooping stuff again (who told you that was okay?). He probably just bought a few special dating outfits to impress you and isn't with the NSA. Look, honey, all these charity event invitations!!Nope, not the gala kind where you get to wear your LBD and heels kind. When you are married to a Silicon Valley programmer, events like your second cousin's wedding in the Midwest can become uncomfortable charity events. It all begins when your grandma or whomever starts bragging to the table that J is like the best computer person, like, ever. I mean like rockets and spaceships and stuff (sorry, J, I think what you do is very interesting, but it's not rockets and spaceships). And, of course, the GOBS of money. Because everyone in SV makes LOADS of money (please note the extremely heavy sarcasm). Protip: It's important to master the "polite smile" so that at events like this you don't let the annoy seep through the polite. Everyone at the table is *very* impressed and mentions that cousin Eddy needs a website and Aunt Doris needs help with using Word and so on and so forth. Protip: It's important to attend weddings with open bars. OMG! This trophy is for me? But I didn't do anything to earn it! But I didn't even prepare an acceptance speech! I'm so embarrassed! No, really, I'm embarrassed. If you are an attractive woman married to a programmer, people will sometimes give you a trophy whether you earned it or not. Like, even if you married your programmer when he had 3k to his name and lived in a seedy apartment. Trophy. To illustrate, I was shopping for a pair of nice heels at a nice department store (which I was paying for out of our joint account, to which we both contribute) and the overly-friendly salesperson asked me, "Are you married? What does your husband do?" They asked me nothing about what I do or my life. I told them that J is a computer guy, to which they responded, "Wow! That must be so nice - the success (wink) - and you get to come and buy shoes!!!" hmmmkaaay... I wore my trophy shoes on our next date to a nice restaurant in SF (we were celebrating an anniversary). J wore a logo tee, naturally. We were showered with a ridiculously embarrassing amount of attention by the manager, the sommelier, and the waiter. I mean, at a certain point it crosses a line from "attentive" to "why don't you just join us at our table". So, if you love a programmer, be prepared to occasionally embrace the trophy. Match his socks correctly and he will bring you flowers. It's true that programmers have their little oddities. J, for example, will not wear socks unless they match exactly perfectly. He says that it makes him feel weird all day long. But, for as many little quirks as he or they may have, they have 10 times more love to give. J shows his love in all sorts of little ways. And he really listens, even when I'm talking on and on about some random Quora answer. He knows how to make me happy when I'm sad and how to make me laugh and why I hate surprises. Programmers are pretty awesome.
