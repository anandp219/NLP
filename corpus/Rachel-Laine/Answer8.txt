 There are surely exceptions, but I think it's generally unwise to put your life on hold until you achieve whatever goal or milestone it is you have in mind. It can be quite a slippery slope. "I will start dating when I am self-supporting" can quickly turn into "I will start dating when I make above x dollars per year and I can attract a better woman." I have fallen into this trap a time or two myself and have more than a few regrets. There was a time in my life when I was quite overweight and I told myself that I would socialize more when I lost weight or I would buy clothes when I lost weight. While I'm sure that some people take dating to the extreme even in college with fancy dinners and ski vacations and gifts, this is the exception not the rule. Cook spaghetti together or take a picnic to the beach. Attend parties together. Take in a cheap movie. Volunteer somewhere together. There are countless things to do that don't involve emptying your wallet (or your parent's wallet). If it is your parents who are subsidizing your life right now, have you thought about why they might be doing this? When I talk to parents about why they pay for their children's educations I get all sorts of reasons, but the gist is usually to help to them get a really great head start on their adult life. These parents are looking to give their children an advantage, not to hinder their social lives. It's possible that they would be quite sad and surprised to discover that you have shut down an entire aspect of your life on their account. Tip: Keep everyone happy by keeping your grades up and maintaining balance in your life.
