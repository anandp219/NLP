 If you want to pursue a friendship with this person, you might be happier if begin by choosing activities that are lighter on conversation and heavier on experiences. Select activities that don't emphasize conversation, but allow the two of you to build a shared history that will eventually give you things to talk about other than television. Take a yoga class together, for example, or go to a concert. Trivia nights are another option or paint nights. There are a lot of possibilities. There are plenty of reasons why someone might focus on discussing non-personal things or might not feel comfortable disclosing personal things in the early stages of a friendship. It doesn't really matter why. Rather than focusing on what they aren't talking about, focus on getting to know them better first in a different type of environment. If you aren't satisfied with the level of disclosure as time goes on, you are not obligated to pursue the friendship or you can simply keep the friendship very casual.
