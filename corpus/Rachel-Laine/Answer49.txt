 Michael Jackson said, "That to give someone a piece of your heart, is worth more than all the wealth in the world." Bhavesh has certainly given us a piece of his heart. My great grandmother was a very industrious, hard-working farmer's wife. She was quite old-school in many ways and light years ahead of her time in many other ways. She would speak about "quality" people. If great grandma said that someone was quality (and not many people were bestowed with this mark) we knew that she thought of them in the highest regard, and that we should, too. Bhavesh is *most definitely* a quality person. Maybe even her exact definition of a quality person.Bhavesh is a rare mix of very hard working and whip smart and playful and funny. He is incredibly witty and while he is most certainly a studious adult, his childlike sense of wonder hasn't become a casualty of his adultness. Bhavesh knows how to weave a compelling story together, so go and read some of his answers, for goodness sake - now!! He really knows his stuff, too! Everything from science and medicine to philanthropy to music to fitness to childhood pleasures. Like many of us here on Quora, Bhavesh is an introvert and a charmingly humble one at that. I'm glad that I have gotten to know him and call him a friend.
