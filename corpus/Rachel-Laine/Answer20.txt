 Rather than trying to determine if you are getting the same dollar-for-dollar benefits as your coworkers, try thinking about this question from an employer's point of view. You will almost always lose when you play the tit-for-tat game. Someone is going to take more sick days than you, someone is going to use more dental or health insurance benefits, someone is going to consume more of those sugar packets offered near the coffee machine, or eat more shrimp at the employee retreat. If you shift your view and consider how you might lure in and keep employees if it were your company, your perspective might change a bit. Ultimately, employers want to attract, hire, and retain good employees. Most employers also care about each of their employees and want to promote their health and well-being (which also serves goal number one). One way to attract good employees is to offer benefits that good employees want. Great maternity and paternity leave benefits fall squarely into this category. Maternity and paternity benefits aren't designed as a slight to non-parents just as offering vegetarian options in the cafeteria isn't designed as a slight to carnivores or offering a health club membership isn't designed as a slight to the workout averse. Almost all companies offer more benefits than any one person can take advantage of simply because they design benefits to attract many types of people. Many employers also offer a paid sabbatical which is a benefit that you do not need to be a new or expecting parent to utilize. So some companies do offer a somewhat comparable benefit. Even if your company does not offer a sabbatical, you might still come out ahead in the endurance race. Sometimes new parents who take long leaves or vacations are overlooked for promotions or raises, depending on the company culture. Take a good look at your company's benefits portfolio and seek out the benefits that were designed to attract you.
