 Wouldn't it be a different world if today's big behemoth companies that sip on a fuel of bureaucracy and TPS reports were populated only by the academically brightest minds? People are hired for a wide variety of reasons. It's possible that you are right and that your peer wasn't as strong as some other candidates in one area, but he might have been the best match in other areas and they decided that he would improve with experience and on-the-job training. When you are coming out of an academic environment that focuses on a very narrow subject, it's very easy to get caught up in the idea that mastery in this subject is the only thing that employers are looking for. This isn't the case. Certainly not for all employers.The transition from college to your first job is difficult and it's even more difficult when you feel as though others are lapping you on the track. It's normal to feel anxious and nervous -- this is what you have spent the last four or five years of your life preparing for, after all. It sounds like you were an excellent student. If I were you I would spend an equivalent amount of effort "studying" - practicing and researching - to look for a job. Getting the right work takes some work.
