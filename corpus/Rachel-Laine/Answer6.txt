 The most valuable lessons that my mother taught me were things that I learned by watching her. Perhaps the most important of these lessons is to never stop learning or trying new things. Sometimes I find it tempting to not try something new because I might fail. All sorts of possibilities and anxieties run through my head like a ticker tape - I might embarrass myself or fall flat on my face or just be plain ol' bad. But then some small part of me remembers that my mom continues to learn and try new things all the time and it makes her a better person and I try. She finds new passions and friends and becomes wiser all the time by trying new things.
