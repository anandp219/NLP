 When I was in preschool I told my mother, "You go to college and then you go to work. Then you get married and have kids. Then you die." My mother laughs heartily about this, but I knew even at 4 years old that I was expected to attend college. That there was no choice. As it turns out, I did go to college, then I started my career, then I got married, and now I'm having a child, but I digress... The sense of obligation that I felt to attend college was very real and, at the time, a real burden and source of trouble in my life. I struggled a lot (understatement) during that time in my life and I mistakenly assumed that I was miserable because I did not get to make any real choices for myself. It was college or college.I was directionless and bitter and I chose to behave like a petulant toddler for quite a few years. I drifted in and out of majors and various mischievous antics. I finally graduated six years and six years of summer courses later (and a few sternly worded emails from my parents). Years later when I had settled into a job and a life and into my own skin, I realized that my malcontent during my college years wasn't owed to being forced to go to college - it was owed to having to grow up. Growing up is actually pretty hard and all sorts of uncomfortable and awkward. Maybe I was just particularly behind the curve, but I had to learn a lot in college and only a small percentage of that was from a textbook. I realize now that college is a wonderful, insular environment in which to do that kind of learning. But hey, it's very possible that you're absolutely nothing like me and that you have nothing to discover or learn about yourself. I suppose that some people just have their stuff together (wait - don't most people think that they are one of those people?). If this is the case, I would focus on getting a degree that complements what you really want to do. Spend your time and energy developing relationships in the industry that you want to work in.
