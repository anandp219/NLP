 I am not at all offended if someone forgets my name. Similarly, I'm not troubled at all when people call me Rachelle or Rebecca and I have to gently correct them. This happens a lot, actually. So why do some people work so hard to remember and match names to faces? I think that there are a lot of situations in which it communicates to people that you care or respect them or, maybe more importantly, don't care so much or respect them. There is a whole lot communicated in the few seconds of an initial greeting. If you were giving a sales pitch to potentially very important clients, but didn't appear to have tried to learn their names it might not reflect well. If someone you really looked up to or admired couldn't remember your name you might feel a little hurt - as if they didn't care about you. I think, generally speaking, people care how they are received by others and sometimes the little things like remembering names aren't so little.
