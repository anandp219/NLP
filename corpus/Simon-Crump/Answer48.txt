 There's a very broad generalisation which says that snowboarders suffer more minor injuries but skiers' injuries are often more serious. Snowboarders fall over frequently, especially beginners, but they are at less risk of lower body injuries because everything is fixed in place. Consequently, snowboarders tend to fracture wrists, ribs and collar bones. In contrast, skiers are at risk of twisting their knees, which can easily result in a painful injury followed by surgery, months of rehabilitation and a joint which never fully recovers. Competent skiers also tend to travel faster than their equivalent snowboarders so, if they do hit something, the impact tends to be greater.However, simply falling over isn't the whole story. Intermediate skiers are more inclined to stay within the relative safety of marked runs, while snowboarders are drawn earlier to the soft, deep powdery snow away from the piste. The risks of going off-piste are manyfold; avalanche, concealed rocks, tree wells, unmarked cliffs, etc. These dangers are more life-threatening than the incidents you're likely to get mixed up in on the groomers.Of course, advanced skiers are heading off-piste in ever greater numbers too, as the popularity of powder skis testifies, and any activity which involves sliding down an icy mountain is unavoidably hazardous whether you are on one or two planks. Lots of fun though.
