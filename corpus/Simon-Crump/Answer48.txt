 Varoufakis, like many other left-leaning figures, appeals to people because he tells them what they want to hear.People want to be told that their problems are someone else's fault. They want to be told that everything will get better without them having to do anything about it. And, at a time when many governments have run up large debts, they want to be told that their government can bring its finances under control without cutting public spending. Varoufakis brings all this, but he is also very good-looking, highly charismatic and he speaks perfect English. As populists go, he takes some beating.
