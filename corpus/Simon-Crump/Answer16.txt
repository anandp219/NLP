 Breakfast is usually a bowl of granola and cold milk, sometimes followed by a banana. When I get bored of that I have buttered toast with Roses lemon and lime marmalade instead.Lunch is normally taken at my office but I try to plan ahead and make something at home to take with me. I aim to make a salad at least twice a week and at the moment that consists of chopped romaine lettuce, celery, a sliced red apple, a sliced fresh chilli, walnuts and blue cheese, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The problem is it seems to take a long time to prepare and so other days I just make a sandwich, roast beef and horseradish is first choice. But if I have nothing in the fridge I will go to the bakery over the road from my office instead where they make sandwiches to order. There's a fabulous chicken tikka and mint mayo sandwich they do there which I take on a large wholemeal roll, but tomorrow I have my eye on the lamb kofta. The evening meal is the main event. I'd have curry every day if my wife let me and I make a lamb and cauliflower rogan josh which stews all day in the oven. Otherwise we do a chicken stir fry or a pasta meal; Thai prawn curry is another favourite or maybe grilled tuna steak with fries and peppers.I don't think there's anything particularly unusual about that menu. British cuisine is very international these days but perhaps there is more bread and cheese than in some other places. One thing that might set me apart is that I don't drink tea and never have done, I just drink water all day.
