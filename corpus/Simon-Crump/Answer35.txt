 When policemen become indistinguishable from soldiers, liberty has already been lost. There is nothing left to defend. The right to bear arms does not and cannot protect US citizens from the state. No militia could ever hope to challenge it now, no matter how many automatic weapons they have stashed in their log cabins. That particular arms race has already been decided.This is what a police officer looks like where I live (see below). Outside of high-profile targets such as airports, the most lethal weapon he carries is a can of pepper spray. The important difference is that in Britain policing occurs by consent, not by force. That's liberty right there.Now as it happens, a policeman was killed on Merseyside yesterday, 5th October 2015. That area includes Liverpool, one of Britain's largest cities and not known for its conformity or allegiance to the government in Westminster, yet David Phillips was the first police officer in 34 years to be murdered while on duty there. And he wasn't shot, he was run over by someone in a stolen car. The last school shooting in Britain was in 1996, following which handguns were outlawed. No child has been shot dead at school since and for the most part parents feel safe dropping their kids off in the morning. That's what liberty feels like, and the price of it is that ordinary citizens don't get to walk around with a gun.You see, the freedom to own and carry a gun could be considered one form of liberty, but freedom from the fear of all the other nutjobs who are carrying them is another. You can't have both.
