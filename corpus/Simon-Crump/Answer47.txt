 UKTrump is the joke candidate. The person you have in the contest so that whoever wins in the end, you can look back and say, ah well it could have been a whole lot worse.However, as we just found out here, sometimes the joke candidate can win. The Labour Party in Britain have a tradition in their leadership elections of always nominating someone from the far left of the party. They're nominated to show how inclusive the party is and how it hasn't forgotten its roots and this time that candidate was Jeremy Corbyn. But this time, even though his odds at the start of the race were of the order of 200-1, Corbyn won.In some ways, Trump is the anti-Corbyn. Both hold views which place them at the extreme fringe of their party. Neither has any experience of government. Both have ridden a wave of populism to galvanise new supporters and re-engage jaded voters. Both would make a terrible leader of their country.The problem is that Americans have form for electing celebrities into positions of power; Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger spring to mind. And while Prime Minster Corbyn might not cause much damage outside the UK, President Trump would be a disaster for the whole world.From outside he appears to be completely unelectable but we have a saying over here in the old country; "Only in America". Please, no.
