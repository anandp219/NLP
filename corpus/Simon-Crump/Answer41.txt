 Journey's Ross Valory is known to prefer a Musicman Stingray bass. These guitars have been available since 1976 and, as Don't Stop was recorded in 1981, it seems likely that he used one to record it.The punchy sound is certainly consistent with a Musicman Stingray. Although twin pickup models were later produced, the classic configuration has a solitary twin-coil pickup mounted very close to the bridge, almost forcing the player to achieve that sound. The tone on the recording is also clearly pick rather than finger-style. Commit to the riff and play it hard down near the bridge.Effects-wise, you can hear compression and lashings of chorus. The chorus is what makes the bass sound really distinctive in this song.
