 I think the whole concept of "white" will become meaningless quicker than you think.There are still parts of America where white people only breed with other white people but that is going to change. Look around major cities in America and Europe and you will see people of indeterminate race all around you. We live in a globalized world and our genetic diversity is beginning to reflect that. By the time you need to explain that you are a quarter white, a quarter black, a quarter Chinese and a quarter Pacific Islander, none of it really matters anymore.The "white" people you're asking about might become a minority in America but slightly off-white people may never do. It's an entirely artificial distinction and it will become increasingly difficult to pigeonhole people and assign an arbitrary race to them.
