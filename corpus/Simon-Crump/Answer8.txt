 I enjoy Peter Hawkins' writing and find it very instructive. Peter's PPE from Oxford trumps my degree in Industrial Economics from Birmingham on matters of political philosophy and I've learnt a great deal from reading his answers.I don't want to speak for Peter here but I think one difference may be in our approach to utilitarianism. Peter is fairly clear in his rejection of utilitarianism and has opined that any policy which results in a worse outcome for a single individual, even if it improves the outcome for everyone else, is morally inferior. He wrote a great answer about this which I have searched for and been unable to find.I'm more equivocal on this and I'm happy to support an outcome which delivers the greatest benefit to the greatest number, within reason and so long as there is no discrimination or arbitrary selection. Inequality is inevitable and will tend towards a Pareto optimum, so I hold that public policy should be aimed at maximizing social mobility rather than eliminating inequality itself.Peter has been heavily influenced by John Rawls' A Theory of Justice, which I have not read. It's on my list.
