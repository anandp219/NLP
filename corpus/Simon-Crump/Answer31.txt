 There is a wide variety of responses, ranging from "Oh no, these people have had such a hard time and are so desperate, we must do everything we can to help them" to "We have too many foreigners in this country already, we must stop any more of them coming in". Both these extremes and everything in between can be heard in just about every European country. In some countries, such as Germany, more people lean more toward the former view, in others such as Hungary, more people lean toward the latter.Europe is not one nation and so part of what makes the situation so difficult is that many people are inclined to see it all as somebody else's problem. When refugees are trying to smuggle themselves into the UK from Calais, residents of the south of England are likely to say "they're quite safe in France, why don't they just stay there". Similarly, European leaders point to the fact that the refugees arrive via Turkey and argue that they can't claim asylum in their country if they have already made it to safety in Turkey.It's a region-wide problem but there isn't a region-wide authority capable of dealing with it. The EU lacks the sovereignty required to force member states to accept refugee quotas and any attempt it makes to do so may backfire and strengthen opposition to the EU from within.
