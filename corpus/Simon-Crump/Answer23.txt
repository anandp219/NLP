 I don't have much of a problem with Facebook optimizing their position within the law. I'm more concerned that what this situation seems to indicate is that our tax code isn't really fit for purpose.Global internet companies like Facebook do pose something of a challenge for legislators. It shouldn't be too difficult to work out how much revenue they've generated from UK advertisers but clearly most of the costs are in the US; most of their employees are there and most of their servers are there. Their UK operation is entitled to assume responsibility for some of the expenses incurred by their US hub and they would seem to have engineered the accounts in this case in order to wipe out their taxable profit.Our legislators need to respond to this and figure out how to make it more difficult for multinationals like FB to export all their profit. There's no point whining about FB acting in their own interests because they have a duty to their shareholders to do so and it would be negligent of them to pay a penny more tax than our laws require them to. It's our law which needs to catch up and respond to the modern-day globalized environment.
