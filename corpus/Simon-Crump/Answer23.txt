 No, not unless you have a "Portable Document A1" or E101 from your country of origin, which states that you are making the equivalent contributions back home in Germany:New employee coming to work from abroadAlthough National Insurance was originally a ring-fenced fund which paid for pensions and unemployment benefits, it is now effectively just a part of general taxation. As such, it would make sense for it to be abolished and incorporated into income tax, but this is politically awkward as it would make the tax system more transparent and people might realise their marginal tax rate is higher than they thought. There is also an additional element of National Insurance which is paid by the employer and which the employee never sees in their payslip.If you are living and working in the UK, you are obliged to pay the relevant taxes. Historically there were loopholes which allowed self-employed people to operate through a limited company and avoid National Insurance but these have been all but closed by the government via legislation known as IR35.Note that around half of British people also contribute to private pension schemes, either independently or through their employer. These pay out in addition to any pension they are eligible to via the state pension scheme.
