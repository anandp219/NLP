 I'm sure Corbyn would consider capital controls to be completely unnecessary, but they would ultimately become inevitable under any government led by him.Corbyn imagines that he could fund all of his spending plans just by cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion. This is extremely naive. Tax rises would be necessary and naturally they would be targeted at the wealthiest. These tax rises would almost certainly raise no additional revenue because the extra received from those who were willing to pay would be cancelled out by those opting to take their money and leave. As soon as this became clear, Corbyn would announce capital controls due to the "exceptional circumstances".Rupert points out in his answer that capital controls are illegal under EU law. However, there will be a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU before the next general election and the "no" vote is looking alarmingly strong. It is possible that the UK could already be on its way out of the EU before Corbyn could take office.An EU exit is currently opposed by the majority of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) and Corbyn says he will not campaign for an exit because he respects that opinion [1]. His personal view, though, is that the EU is a capitalist project and he is somewhat equivocal about it [2]. His mentor Tony Benn was a consistent Eurosceptic [3][4] and it is not out of the question that a new look PLP aligned more with Corbyn's politics would be in favour of exit. I would posit therefore that a Corbyn government would impose capital controls in the medium term, even if they had to leave the EU in order to do so.[1] Jeremy Corbyn confirms that he will not campaign for Britain to leave the EU[2] Jeremy Corbyn: Our EU debate has been hijacked  here's what we should be talking about[3] Jeremy Corbyns world: his friends, supporters, mentors and influences[4] Tony Benn: The case against the EU is its lack of Democracy
