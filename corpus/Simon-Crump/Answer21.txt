 None.The British Empire no longer exists and the Commonwealth of Nations is not an empire. It is not an organisation of states subservient to the Crown, even though some of them have retained the Queen as their head of state. Most Commonwealth nations are now republics and a few actually have their own monarch. The only criteria for membership of the Commonwealth is a broad commitment to principles of equality, human rights, peace and free trade.Member states of the Commonwealth do pay subscription dues, but these pertain to the running costs of the Commonwealth itself and are not passed onto either the Crown or the UK Government. Indeed, the UK Government is obliged to pay these dues just like any other member.
