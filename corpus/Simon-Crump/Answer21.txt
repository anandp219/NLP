 I have never met an Edwina in person either, but in Britain the name will always be associated with former Tory MP and Junior Health Minister, Edwina Currie. Edwina Currie was a household name in the 1980s, happy to attract attention to herself and well-known for being outspoken and at times politically incorrect. She was forced out of her health ministry job after announcing that most UK egg production was infected with salmonella (a claim which later turned out to be true) and had a four-year affair with the future Prime Minister John Major. She was notorious enough to have her own puppet on the satirical TV show, Spitting Image, and established her own media career after losing her parliamentary seat in 1997. Given the sample size of one, the name Edwina for me evokes a strong and rambunctious woman who you wouldn't want to mess with. I neither like nor dislike it especially.
