 No we don't know them all.Some billionaires are interested in the fame and the glory which their wealth can bring, but most are not. For the latter, public recognition of their status is an inconvenience which attracts unwanted attention from the jealous and the greedy, such as criminals, tax collectors, and anti-capitalist campaigners. It can make personal relationships difficult because it can be difficult to judge the motives of people seeking to make their acquaintance.A wealthy entrepreneur I know once appeared in The Sunday Times Rich List [1], an annually compiled list of the richest people in Britain, due to a business deal which took place in the public domain. This caused him some anxiety and he instructed his accountants to ensure that he did not appear in the list when it appeared again the following year. He lives modestly, pays his taxes and donates generously to charities, and he does not want his family harassed or otherwise put at risk. It suits him better to stay under the radar.Concealing one's wealth is not necessarily a sign of dishonest intentions and there are many good reasons to keep your finances private. The billionaires we know about are the ones who like to flaunt their wealth or who acquired it via means which are well known and publicly documented. There are many others who are quietly going about their business without drawing so much attention to themselves.[1] Rich List | Public | The Sunday Times
