 Russia's objectives are fairly clear; support Assad's regime because he is a long-term ally and crush all the various rebellions. Western/American objectives are less clear. They don't like secular dictators like Assad and Saddam but they don't like theocratic revolutionaries either. They aspire to an idealistic scenario where democracy and Western freedoms can flourish, even though there are too few people in the region who actively pursue those values. They support rebels fighting against secular dictators right up until the point at which they become theocrats, then start looking for someone new to support.This brings Russia into conflict with the West because the West currently support the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and Russia does not. That is the main bone of contention because everyone hates ISIS and no-one outside Turkey pays much attention to the Kurds.So from a Western perspective the Russians are attacking the wrong people because they are targeting the FSA more than ISIS, and because their weapons are perhaps not quite as technically advanced as the Americans there is also more in the way of collateral damage. Russia seems to be aiming for a resolution in which Assad remains in charge but large parts of Syria are reduced to rubble and most of the population have left.
