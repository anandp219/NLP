 Where I live in the north west of England we are supplied with three different bins by the local council for putting our waste into. There is a weekly collection service.The grey bin is for clean recyclables. Into this we put newspapers and magazines, plus plastic packaging, empty cans, jars and bottles. Anything which contained wet goods like fruit juice or sauces should be cleaned first.The green bin is for garden waste like grass cuttings and leaves. However, uncooked vegetable waste like potato peelings can also go in here.The black bin is for all non-recyclable waste so this is where leftover food scraps and and other waste like crisp packets go. This waste can be messy so we use sturdy black plastic bin-liners in the bin we have inside, and then transfer the waste in the tied-up bag to the outside bins when it is full. The bin-liners we use are of the 40-litre variety.Other councils have a different recycling system and some of them have more bins so that the initial sorting can be done by the residents themselves. For instance, they might have separate bins for paper and plastics.
