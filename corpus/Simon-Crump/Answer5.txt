 Wikipedia tells us that:Capitalism is an economic system in which trade, industry, and the means of production are privately owned and operated via profit and loss calculation (price signals) through the price system.A good way to judge which is the most capitalist country might therefore be to rank countries by how easy it is to operate a business there. The World Bank Group's Doing Business website ranks Denmark as the easiest place to do business in the EU, followed by the UK, then Sweden, Norway and Finland:Ranking of economies - Doing Business - World Bank GroupAnother way to determine which country is the most capitalist would be to rank them by the percentage of the workforce which is in private sector employment. This time the Scandinavian countries are way down the list due to their large public sectors, with Spain, Germany and Italy leading the way and the UK mid-table:Challenges for Public Administration in Latin America (see figure 2.1)A variation of this method would be to rank the countries by public spending as a percentage of total GDP, with the more capitalist countries being those with a lower percentage. The winner here is Slovakia, with other countries from the former Eastern-bloc close behind and the northern countries bringing up the rear:List of Government Spending as % of GDPAlternatively you might decide that the most capitalist country in today's global economy is the one which attracts the most foreign investment. Investors seek returns, and so investment will go to countries which offer profit opportunities without excessive corporate taxation. By this measure the UK is the clear winner:Foreign investment into UK is highest in Europe and second highest in worldThe overall picture is therefore inconclusive. The UK might be the most capitalist country in the EU were it not for its large public sector, and the Scandinavian countries are also good places to do business in spite of theirs. It ultimately comes down to which criteria you want to judge it by.
