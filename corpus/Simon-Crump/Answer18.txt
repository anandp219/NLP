 Greece shares its currency with a large number of other nations, most of which have a much stronger economy. Greece represents only a very small part of the Eurozone.This means that the normal mechanism via which the value of a currency falls during times of economic difficulty does not function in the case of Greece. The value of their currency is propped up by more successful Eurozone nations like Germany.This works to Greece's disadvantage and makes recovery less likely. If they had their own currency and it was free to fall in value, their exports would become cheaper and they would be more able to produce their way out of the crisis.
