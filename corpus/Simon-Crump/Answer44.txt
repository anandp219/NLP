 Free trade is a mutually beneficial set of transactions, which is to say that it benefits all parties. Trade between nations thereby makes those nations dependent on each other for their continuing wealth and prosperity. I'm not going to want bomb your cities if they are a major market for my exports.Free trade also leads to specialization. One nation may become specialized in building cars while another specializes in growing wheat. If a war between the two prevents trade, one nation goes hungry while the other loses its preferred supplier of cars.Free trade promotes communication. Trade requires people to talk to people in other countries and frequently to visit them. Interpersonal relationships are created across borders which build cultural understanding and respect.Free trade tears down borders and makes us part of one, big, global society. Wars make no sense in an entirely open trading environment because everyone's interests align.However, where trade is not free, resentment grows and conflicts arise. If one country, perhaps an imperial power, imposes unfair trading restrictions on others, those other countries may feel they have nothing to lose by challenging them.
