 You've got three main options and which is best depends on how much luggage you have, budget, time constraints, etc.. You'll probably want to go by train or rent a car.Car. Innsbruck to Venice is a fantastic drive. You head over the Brenner Pass and then you are in the Dolomites, a uniquely beautiful and spectacular mountainous region. You also pass Lake Garda so if you have time to stop along the way and enjoy the scenery, driving is the way for you. It's about four hours driving time via Verona but you'll want to take longer.Train. Most train journeys from Innsbruck to Venice require a change in Verona and this is probably the cheapest way to go as tickets start at 39. There is one direct train daily which gets you there in around four and half hours. You will experience much the same scenery as driving but you obviously won't be able to stop and look around:Timetable Munich-Innsbruck-ItalyFlying isn't a great option because there isn't a direct flight, so at best it's going to take you two and half hours via Vienna. Innsbruck airport is certainly interesting though, situated as it is in a steep-sided mountain valley. Tickets start at around 200.
