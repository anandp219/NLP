 Momentarily.In traditional British usage, the word momentarily means "for a short period of time", but in American usage it seems to mean "very soon". Sadly, the American usage has caught on in Britain enough for no-one to be entirely sure what is meant by it.If I say to you "I will be with you momentarily", that could mean I don't have much time to spend with you or that I will attend to you as soon as possible. I suspect the former meaning may die out and we will need a new word to express that idea.
