 Perhaps you behave like a dick when you drink.You might not realise that you do because one of the first things drinking does to us is suspend our ability to realise we are being a dick. When we are in a group of people who are also drinking, we don't realise what dicks they're being either and everyone just eggs each other on.As an experiment sometime, just try spending an evening with your buddies when they are all drinking and you are not. It may provide some insight into how your wife feels when you drink. Drinking can be a lot of fun but it's certainly not a spectator sport. Eventually it becomes painfully embarrassing. If your wife is not a habitual drinker you might want to spend more time sober when you are with her. And if having a few drinks with your buddies is really important to you, it might be better to do it when she's not around.
