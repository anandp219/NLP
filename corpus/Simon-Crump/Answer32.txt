 I vaguely knew of him through his association with Jackass. As such my opinion of him was much the same as the rest of the Jackass team, i.e. a somewhat amusing and rather reckless man-child who was prepared to hurt himself for our entertainment.Then he appeared on the Channel 4 show, The Jump, which is how he came to be acquainted with Stacey Solomon. The Jump is a strange show in which a number of celebrities are taught a variety of winter sports and compete against each other. It's not highly rated but I watched it because I'm a keen winter sports enthusiast myself and I'm familiar with the shooting locations. I have no idea how Channel 4 manage to arrange insurance for the show because the activities are genuinely dangerous; for instance, the previously untrained celebrities are taught to slide down an Olympic track on a skeleton bob. It sounds like the sort of thing Steve O would be brilliant at.But he actually wasn't as good as I expected him to be. He was eliminated about half way through the run, having been beaten at aerials and ski-jumping by a mixed-gender selection of soap stars and socialites. He seemed a little awkward in front of the cameras too, like he didn't know what to make of all these crazy Brits getting chucking themselves down mountains and getting drunk each night in a purpose-built bar next to a ski jump in Austria. It left me thinking that he wasn't some unhinged nutcase after all, but just some OK guy who'd accidentally made a career out of being a stuntman.I didn't know anything about his links with animal rights protests until I saw the other answers to this question. While it's nice to know he believes in something, certain aspects of the animal rights movement seems to me to be rather murky, so I'll reserve judgement on that discovery.
