 The Brummie accent is generally monotone but with a downward inflection. The overall effect can be quite melancholy.The accent has a distinctive vowel sound for "i", such that the word alright sounds more like "olroit".Good Brummie accents are hard to find on YouTube. Rock stars Ozzy Osbourne and Jeff Lynne are both proper Brummies but their accents have changed after years of hard living in the US. Former Formula 1 World Champion Nigel Mansell is actually from Worcestershire, but most people from outside the Midlands would say he sounds like a Brummie.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...- Nigel Mansell appearing on BBC Top Gear
