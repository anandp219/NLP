 In this context you can essentially replace the phrase "middle-class" with the word "bourgeois".The dividing line between the British working class and the lower middle classes was thoroughly obscured during the late twentieth century, particularly during the Thatcher era when many people who identified as working class were able to buy their own home for the first time and became de facto middle-class. As part of that process "middle class" became a pejorative used to describe a certain breed of professionals and business-owners who enjoy higher-than-average incomes and the privilege associated with that. Within the demographic in question, it is used in a similar, ostensibly self-deprecating (but actually celebratory) way to mock their own sense of entitlement and superiority.Example: It's awful, Cordelia was home from boarding school this weekend and she sprained her ankle getting out of the Range Rover after we'd been for tea at the Wolseley. Now I'm worried she won't be able to ski at Easter. Oh listen to me, how terribly middle class!
