 The whole point about democracy is that you are free to propose or oppose any ideas you like, within reason. Communist ideas do exist in western countries but they are not especially popular anymore due to the unpleasant consequences of attempts to implement them in reality.Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels began work on The Communist Manifesto in the Chetham Library in Manchester, UK and it was first published in London in 1848. Neither man was persecuted, arrested or otherwise harassed. The publication has remained freely available ever since and numerous political parties have promoted its content.The path to communism envisaged by Marx, and later developed by Lenin and Trotsky among others, requires a transitional phase of socialism in which the state owns all means of production. Historically this has typically resulted in authoritarian, one-party states in which democracy and free speech were suppressed, and production itself became inefficient and misdirected. Collectivization of agriculture at a national level has a particularly bad track record, too often resulting in famine and starvation. And crucially, the final stage of the transition from socialism to true communism has never occurred in practice, meaning that communism remains a utopian ideal rather than an achievable outcome.The broad consensus of democratic political systems has therefore been to deliver social democracies based on capitalism, featuring state intervention to redistribute wealth where necessary. Few people in such societies see communism as a viable alternative to this model and so their governments voice opposition to communist revolutionaries who threaten democracy elsewhere.
