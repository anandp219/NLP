 The problem with the weather in Britain is that it is very unpredictable. Within certain parameters you can experience a warm, pleasant day or a cold, miserable one at almost any time of year. I've sunbathed in February and I've known days in August when the temperature never made it into double figures (Celsius). The warmest day I've ever had in years of hill-walking in the Lake District was in March 2012.It means that average temperature and rainfall charts are not much help when determining what kind of weather you are likely to encounter. Obviously, it tends to be colder in winter than in summer but the main difference is the length of the days. Days in December are depressingly short, whereas it doesn't get dark for long in mid-summer at all.All that said, my personal observation is that late September and early October is one of the most settled times of year. I would be more confident about organising an outdoor event then than in August, for example. The first days of October in Brighton are unlikely to be hot by anyone else's standard but you stand a fighting chance of them being at least fine and pleasant.
