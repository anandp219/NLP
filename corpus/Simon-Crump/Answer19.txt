 Not every policy debate can be framed in a simple left/right or liberal/conservative paradigm. A person's views on economics can exist independently from any views they might have about gun control, abortion, foreign policy or the death penalty.Unfortunately, these political realities are obscured in the United States because of its two-party system. Republicans are usually associated with a more liberal (in the original sense) approach to economics, along with opposition to gun control and abortion and an interventionist foreign policy, while Democrats tend to adopt the opposite position in those areas. These policy bundles, while convenient, are artificial. Even amongst Republican Party members you will find libertarians who do not favour interventionist foreign policy, or people whose views on abortion are not influenced by religious belief. In countries with more fragmented political systems such debates are generally more nuanced and less interdependent.Sanders has strong views on economics and the redistribution of wealth but he doesn't seem especially interested in the gun control debate. This may be because he has no strong feeling on the subject or it may be because his own personal views contrast with those of many of the people whose votes he covets. I imagine he doesn't want to dilute his message on inequality by alienating anyone over gun control. There is no clear or obvious link between left-wing economics and gun control. Sanders argues for one but not the other. Somebody else might disagree with him on both. That's OK.
