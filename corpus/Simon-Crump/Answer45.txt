 It won't necessarily. There will be a sudden and dramatic re-alignment of the convertability of the money Greeks use compared to that of other countries, but there is no reason why it should result in ongoing inflation.If Greece exits the Eurozone it will have to re-introduce its own currency, the drachma. This will find its own value on the currency markets and it will be fairly weak to begin with. Greeks will find that imported goods become very expensive but it will help their export trade immensely and encourage more tourism. Unemployment will go down but material living standards will not immediately improve. Ordinary Greeks will no longer be able to afford German cars.Whether or not inflation sets in depends on the monetary policy implemented by the Greek government post-exit. Their borrowing options are likely to be limited due to their poor credit record but if they are tempted to regularly print excessive amounts of money after their initial currency launch ("quantitative easing" as it is called now) that will likely lead to an inflationary cycle. If they exploit their improved trading conditions to rebuild their economy based on exports however, there is no reason why their currency cannot establish credibility and gain value in the longer term.
