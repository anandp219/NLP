 It would almost certainly result in a reduction in tax revenues, as well as a shift of the tax burden from the richest in society to the average earner. I present two pieces of evidence to support this.Firstly, the socialist French president Franois Hollande introduced a 75% top rate of income tax shortly after being elected in 2012. Individual income tax revenues fell by 4.9bn in the year following introduction of the new tax rate, contributing to a total revenue of only 16bn in contrast to the French government's prediction of 30bn. The 75% rate has now been dropped and the top rate is back down to 45%.France forced to drop 75% supertax after meagre returnsHollande's 75% 'Supertax' Failure A Blow To Piketty's EconomicsSecondly, during the 1980s, the top rate of income tax in the UK was reduced from 83% to 40%. During that time the proportion of income tax paid by the top one percent of earners increased from 11% to 25% [1]. To put it another way, the tax burden on the 99% was less when there was a top tax rate of 40% than it was with a tax rate of 83% (75% of total income tax versus 89%).As the French have recently discovered, confiscatory tax rates lead to capital flight and are counter-productive. As soon as you raise tax rates beyond that which the wealthy consider "fair", they will simply stop paying them.[1] Sunday Times leader, 11th Sep 2011.
