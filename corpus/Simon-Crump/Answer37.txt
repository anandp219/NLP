 No, because it has been demonstrated in the last few years that the Euro project is flawed.In principle a single currency is a good idea because it reduces transaction costs across the trading zone and eliminates the uncertainty that exchange rate fluctuations cause. Such benefits were indeed observed following the introduction of the Euro.However, if the currency is shared by several countries which implement varying fiscal policies, problems can arise. Without a fiscal union or federal structure which oversees fiscal policy, divergent policies will exert pressure on the monetary union. Weak spots in the economy will emerge which cannot be addressed within the confines of a single currency. While the Greek economy in particular may have benefited from a currency devaluation in recent years, this could not happen due to their membership of the Euro.The concept of the Euro is sound but the implementation is poor and the safeguards to keep member states' fiscal policy in line are not properly enforced.
