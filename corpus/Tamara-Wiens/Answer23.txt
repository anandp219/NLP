 The LGBTQ community is full of people, raised in cis het normative environments, where the only acceptable/possible way to be was the same as your parents/family/friends/church members/schoolmates/etc. For a large number of these people, lack of information, or fear of being different, or a host of other reasons, can force them to suppress what they feel and who they are for many years. I personally know a gay man who was married for decades to a woman, has children and grandchildren with her, and only came out to himself in his 50's. He met and has now married a friend of mine - did he change his orientation? No, but it might look like that from the outside, when you fail to account for the things that kept him in a straight relationship for so many years.In the OPs case, it's very possible that you were suppressing for the first years of your life - the most insidious part of suppression is that the one doing it may be completely unaware of it, and can blame all of the symptoms (often including anger, depression, dependency, and other self-harming behaviours) on other, nominally related, occurrences. For the OP, the fact that you are now aware that your orientation is possibly not what you thought it was does NOT mean that your current feelings are invalid. You need to take the time to explore how you truly feel, who you are attracted to, and why, and go from there.
