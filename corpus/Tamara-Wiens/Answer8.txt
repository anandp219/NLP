 I don't know that doubting yourself ever completely goes away. I have been fully transitioned for almost 3 years now, and occasionally random events will make me doubt myself. Just this past week, I had a dream that my dangly bits grew back - when I mentioned that to my youngest daughter (one of my strongest supporters!), she mentioned that she had a dream that I de-transitioned. That combination certainly gave me pause, and made me wonder...The feelings of doubt come less often and less strongly, but when you are almost constantly dealing with being different, and noticeably so, it can be difficult to completely avoid the doubts.
