 The motivation for me doesn't change at all. Credits were cute markers signifying reach and popularity but that never incented or disincented me from answering. The thing about the sharing economy, epitomized by sites like Quora, Wikipedia and Instagram, projects like the Linux core or Apache, or even crowd funding, is that the participants are motivated by things other than profit. These can include a bunch of reasons, such as notoriety, social group acceptance and status, supporting a worthy cause or simply adding to human knowledge in some small way. Credits, which were always pretty useless anyway, could be part of that as status markers.My personal motivation has always been the opportunity to add something to the store of human knowledge by contributing my unique experiences and perspective. I suspect that this is likely the motivation for many people. I am doubtful that credit count could be a motivation that generates quality responsive answers.
