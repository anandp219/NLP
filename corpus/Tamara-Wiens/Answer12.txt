 I think that there is a bit of truth in your question - but it's a bit of a Catch-22 for Quora. If they showed new users all of the content available, there would be a lot of lower quality answers shown, which may chase away users who would stay if they had better writers showcased.The thing is that new users aren't restricted to just the "top" content - if a question interests you, click on the question header, and you will get to see lots of answers by other users. If you see a writer whose content you enjoy, then upvote and follow them - that's what I did. Eventually, I got noticed for my writing, and ended up a Top Writer since Feb 2015.Basically, the "top" content gives new users a starting point - it's up to each user to explore from there. The more you explore, and the better (and often more unique) your content is, the more likely it is that you will be featured as part of the "top".
