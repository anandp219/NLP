 Women have three openings in their groin area - the anus, the vagina and the urethra. Unlike men, where the urethra is used for both urination and procreation (picking up seminal fluid from the prostate and semen from the testes), women have two separate openings - the urethra for urination only, and the vagina for the introduction of sperm and for giving birth to offspring.The major components of a woman's groin, from front to back are the vulva (which contains the clitoris, the urethra and vaginal opening, in order, all surrounded by the labia majora and minora), and the anus (separated from the vulva by the perineum).Interestingly, birds have only one opening for all functions, called the cloaca - this is why fresh laid eggs often have feces on them.
