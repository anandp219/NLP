 I think that every trans person, regardless of their support network status, should delay transition as long as they can. Transition is a literally life altering decision, which makes our mental state about our gender much better, but tends to make all the rest of our lives much more challenging. If a trans person can successfully postpone their transition for their whole life, it may not be the most fulfilling, but it will be far easier than transitioning.That said, if your gender dysphoria is driving you to dependency or depression, or if you have suicidal thoughts as a consequence of your identity, then I strongly advise you to seek help from a mental health practitioner, preferably one who is familiar with gender dysphoria. When it's time to transition, you'll know - and you'll go ahead regardless of the status of your support network.
