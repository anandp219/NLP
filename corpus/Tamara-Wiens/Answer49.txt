 As soon as you can safely do so. There are very few good reasons to delay transition other than personal safety, because most of the other reasons involve continued deception and sacrifice and could result in greater damage to the individual and to anyone that they are trying to protect.The ideal age to transition is as early as possible - if we were left ungendered at birth, this would allow each of us to choose the path and gender that we feel most connected to, and would avoid at least some of the negative impacts that occur otherwise. The major impacts are the acculturation into assigned gender, and the physical impacts of puberty. In an ideal world, these wouldn't matter, but the reality is that males and females are treated significantly differently, and this creates a set of in-built responses and behaviours that become harder and harder to change the longer that a trans person pretends to be their assigned gender.Puberty impacts result in a number of issues - for MtF, this includes atypical height/skeletal size, muscularization, facial and body hair growth, and hair loss eventually. For FtM, the impacts also include breast growth, subcutaneous fat deposition and pelvic development. In both cases, early identification of the child as trans will allow the delay of puberty, for one purpose - to allow the child to reach the age of maturity, when, as an adult, they can decide for themselves if they want to make the changes (or lack thereof) permanent.All of this requires significant support, from family and friends, from the law, from the school system, from churches and other religious/social institutions, and so on. The unfortunate reality is that most of this doesn't exist even in some of the most liberal jurisdictions, while in far too many jurisdictions, transition of this type is actively discouraged through a variety of means. The only real answer is to continue pushing back the age at which trans people have access to the required information and support structures that will allow them to come out as early as THEY know their gender, to allow them to develop, socially and physically, as best suits them.
