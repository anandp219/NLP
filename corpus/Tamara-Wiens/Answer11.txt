 To be clear, the term is "Most Viewed Writer", which is only one small dimension of the characterization of "top answerer". The problem is that Quora puts an inordinate amount of emphasis on "views", as page views are what drive advertising revenue, and advertising is very likely to be one of their monetization approaches.Quora has moved to almost exclusively using bots and algorithms to do most of the moderation and "quality" verification on the site. This means that non-quality metrics (like views and upvotes) matter far beyond any impact that they should have.Your displacement was due to a Quoran with a large following writing an answer which appeared in thousands of feeds. If only a few of those click through (or if the answer uses words that Google's indexing mechanism finds particularly interesting), then a SINGLE answer by a person who is NOT an expert will rise to the top.My advice - don't stress it. Quora has multiple systemic problems, and their current approach to dealing with them doesn't give me much hope that anyone who is not part of the "norm" will have a long and successful time on the site. Sorry that I couldn't be more helpful.
