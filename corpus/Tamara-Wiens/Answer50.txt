 I don't know that my experience would apply to anyone else. I suspect, but without any evidence, that it largely depends on WHEN the trans person comes out to themselves, but that is only speculation on my part.I didn't come out to myself in any fashion until I was in my mid-teens, and after a brief exploration of hormone options, I suppressed almost completely for about the next 30 years. As a consequence, I bought into all of the male socialization things that I was taught as a supposed boy, both explicitly (honour, duty, chivalry) and implicitly (competence, strength, power, prominence). I was a huge beneficiary of that socialization, and I continue to be severely embarrassed by the realization that the chauvinistic and misogynistic messaging that feels so hurtful now, when it comes from the mouths of men, was spouting from my lips as recently as two years ago.However, if a trans person embeds fully in the cis culture of their expressed gender, they are likely to be resocialized to a large degree very quickly, particularly if they are willing to listen and emulate the cis people around them. This isn't necessarily best from an equality perspective, but it helps one to blend.
