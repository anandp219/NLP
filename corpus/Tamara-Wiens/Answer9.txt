 I had the same issues with questions about trans people, trans women in particular. Caitlyn Jenner's coming out triggered a flood of trans related questions, many of them incredibly negative. I looked to the Top Writer community for help in downvoting negative/exclusionary answers, and to write positive answers countering the negative perceptions and assumptions.Instead, Quora moderation decided that the best approach was to delete the offending questions, and sanction the users that wrote pejorative answers. I asked that this not be done, I specifically stated to the moderation/user relations team that these issues were painful, but they NEEDED to be dealt with.I think that Quora faces a systemic issue in dealing with marginalized groups in an appropriate way. This is likely due to the fact that the majority of the leadership team is white, heterosexual, well off men, with no visible people of colour or from the LGBT community (as just two examples), and with only one woman regularly visible to the users. There are signs that they are trying to get better, but it seems to be overwhelmingly difficult given the place from where they are starting.
