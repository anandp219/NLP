 There are some significant problems with the question and details. First is that Canadian retailers open to the public are not allowed to decide who may enter. The only allowable restrictions are for health (shirts and shoes restrictions in restaurants) and product protection (no food or drink) - but the restricted people can enter once they get dressed or finish their meal. I can't restrict Christians from entering my corner store simply because I don't like Bible carriers.Second is the assumption that being LGBTQ is about values or lifestyle. This is one of the most pernicious lies told by cis het people about LGBTQ. The reality is that we have as much variance in lifestyle and values as redheads or lefties or tall people - we are born this way, it's not a matter of choice or something as trivial as our religion or hobbies.That said, there is no logically valid argument for exclusion that doesn't violate the law in Canada.
