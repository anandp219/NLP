 All years can be hard, particularly if there isn't a mutual commitment to continue to work on and maintain the relationship. That said, from my own experience, there were 3 particularly hard years. The first was at the 6 year point. We had moved to England, and I was taking my master's degree. My wife was along with me and became more and more morose as the year progressed. We were on the verge at that point, until she committed to not counting on me to make her happy (her own words). It was sad for me, as I realized that I probably wasn't doing all that I could or wanted to do, and it fundamentally changed our relationship. The second was at the 16 year point. I reached the conclusion that our relationship was fundamentally broken, that it wasn't going to change and that there was nothing to be done. I gave up and we actually separated for about 6 months, but we reconciled and carried on.The last was at the 24 year mark. I came out to my ex, and she decided that our marriage wasn't going to work with such a drastic change in me. Although I fought it for a long time, I recognize the wisdom of her decision, and appreciate that we went through with the divorce at that time.Of course, no 2 relationships are the same so YMMV. But our crisis points came at approximately the 7, 15 and 25 year points, which correspond to some things that I've read about difficult/divorce prone years.
