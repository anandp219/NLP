 I first realized that I wasn't "normal" when I was in my late teens - somewhere between 16 and 18, I started to research hormones, because I knew that testosterone was not my friend, and I desperately wanted estrogen instead. However, that was as far as it went until I was 45, and I finally confronted my lifelong feelings about gender. At that point, after a 2 week vacation in which I did nothing but eat, sleep, and read/think beside the pool, I knew that I needed to be true to myself, the one that had been trying to get out for almost 30 years.At that point, I came out to myself as a crossdresser, probably because being a CD seems much less scary - you don't have to give up much of anything, and probably nothing public, unless you want to. But within 2 months or so, I realized that it was so much worse than that, that it wasn't just about the clothes or "playing at" being a woman, I was a woman, had been one for all my life, and needed to be publicly seen as the woman that I knew that I was. I count Feb 3, 2012 as my "coming out to me" day, but by other measures, it could be as early as 1982 (or earlier, because there is other stuff that I was doing without being conscious of it), or as late as early April 2012.
