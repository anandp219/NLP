 I have probably been blocked by many people on Quora. For most of them, I am unaware of the block, or the reason for it - but given that I am pretty liberal with the use of the block function, it's likely that I hold some view, or represent something, that the person who blocked me found offensive in some way. The people that I block are either believers in a view that I find harmful, or have dealt with me in a way that demonstrates disrespect for who and what I am.The one block of me of which I am aware was by a Top Writer, a year or two back, who I unintentionally offended through comments that I made about a gift giving experience. I don't remember the details anymore, but I do know that I tried to explain, and apologize, for causing pain, and it didn't work. I attempt to be more careful when I answer questions or comment, and I am far more likely now to just ignore things than to say something that could offend someone that I want to stay in contact with.
