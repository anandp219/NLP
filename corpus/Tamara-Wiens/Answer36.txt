 Quora answers are expected to address the question as asked. When a question is difficult or impossible to answer in the form in which you see it, you have a couple of options:Ignore the question. Ask for clarification from the OP in the question comments.Ask for clarification from the OP by private message.Attempt to edit the question and/or details to make the question answerable.What you posted was completely correct... as a question comment. However, it didn't answer the question at all, so it can't actually be considered responsive.In my view, both answers should have been collapsed, and I would have down voted them accordingly. Note that collapses can be automated (by Quora bots), manual (by admins) or as a result of down votes. Quora has a problem with the granularity of the reasons for collapsing, so your answer may have been caught by a bot or down votes and you wouldn't necessarily know the real reason. There are a number of tools available, and using them correctly will help ensure that you don't get caught by the mechanisms for improving answer quality.
