 What gay thoughts? Are you finding people of your gender sexually attractive? Do you imagine going on a romantic date with someone of your gender? When you see someone of your gender, do you imagine what they would look like without clothes?If you answer "yes", then maybe you are "getting those gay thoughts" because you are, in fact, gay. On the other hand, maybe you are just thinking in non-linear ways. Only you can tell. The GOOD thing about this is that, if you ARE gay, this is about as good a time to come out as there ever has been in the English speaking world. I suggest exploring those feelings and thoughts a bit more, and see if you really are gay - the worst possible outcome would be to live in denial for all your life rather than taking a chance at true and full happiness.
