 What is a bisexual lifestyle? I fear that most men interpret that to mean "promiscuous", as back when I was dating, acknowledging my orientation attracted a lot of men who were only interested in sex. However, bisexual really just means "attracted to both men and women".I am bisexual, and I spent almost 25 years married - I never cheated on my wife. My greatest desire is to be in an exclusive monogamous relationship - I have been fortunate enough to meet another bi woman who also wants an exclusive monogamous relationship. I don't believe that there are many women or men who truly want to be in open relationships, or with someone who insists on sleeping around. And it would be useful if you didn't conflate bisexuality with a promiscuous lifestyle - orientation is not a choice, beimg faithful to your partner is.
