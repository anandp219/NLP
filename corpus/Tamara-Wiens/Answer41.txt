 I don't have any study based data for the specific question. Anecdotally, approximately 30% of couples in MtF transition stay together. As surgery is not a requirement of transition and isn't discussed or considered relevant in most conversations, it is harder to assess.Edited to address the completely independent question in the question details.Gender dysphoria and various areas of study related to the transgender community are relatively poorly covered from an academic and scientific research perspective. This is partly due to lack of interest on the part of qualified researchers, stigma associated with public perception of gender dysphoria, and the reluctance of trans people to expose themselves to public scrutiny after transition and social assimilation. Accordingly, the statistically significant and scientifically rigorous gathering of survey results about trans people is difficult if not impossible. That said, there are rules of thumb and certain expectations that developed from the observations of long term members of the community. My expectation is that the pre coming out/pre transition orientation of MtF women will conform relatively closely to that of the general public (i.e. the vast majority will present as heterosexual male with significantly smaller proportions presenting as bisexual and gay males). Post transition, this seems to shake out quite a bit differently, with approximately 1/3 of trans women oriented to each of men, women and both (i.e. straight, lesbian and bi). However, there is a period of settling in to orientation, and how a particular person identifies can change over time.
