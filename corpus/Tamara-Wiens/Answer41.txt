 No. The question assumes that gender differences require gender limitations. I don't believe that this is true.As other answers have pointed out, upwards of 90% and likely greater than 99% of humans are cisgender. This means that the probability is likely less than 1% that your child will be discontent with the gender assigned to them at birth. And the reality is that your social experiment will needlessly make your child an object of uncertainty and oddity, something that our monkey genes encourage us to ostracize and ridicule. Far better is to raise your child without cultural gender expectations. This is something that much of the western world is ready for and actively encourages in many ways already. And if you teach your child that there is no requirement to conform to any of those expectations, then you make it possible for them to come out if they need to.
