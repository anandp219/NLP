 I'm not sure of your cultural background, so this answer could be way off track for the norms of your society.As far as I am concerned, being asked this question, even after the previous one, would not be disrespectful. It might not get you the answer that you want, but it wouldn't be wrong to ask.If it's not too late yet, I would suggest that you be ready with some suggestions to deal with the fact that you are both minors, and (I assume) still will be next May. Proposing that he (or another parent) accompany you on the overnight trip, suggest that an older sibling or close family friend could accompany as chaperone/adult assistance, or another alternative that could address her father's objections, would go a long way to getting an answer to your question that you actually want.
