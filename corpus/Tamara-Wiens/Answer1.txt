 So far it appears to be none. This lack of diversity has been pointed out by Top Writers and other users both publicly as questions on Quora and posts in the Facebook support groups, and in PMs to the relevant people - no substantive answer has ever been forthcoming. The reality is that there are no visible PoCs or LGBT or other minority representation within Quora. There is only one visible full-time staff member who is a woman (Tatiana Estevez - I believe that Alecia Morgan is either part time or contract), and she is in the 4th level of the hierarchy. I believe that this lack of diversity plays into the ongoing loss and disengagement of minority and nonprivileged communities from Quora. I have seen the drain on the trans community and in the black community, and I wonder how bad it is for the other underrepresented groups.
