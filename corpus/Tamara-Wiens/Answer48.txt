 Terrible. It's very heavily biased toward an educated, upper middle class, white American male audience, largely due, I believe, to the founders and the employee composition.This doesn't mean that people aren't trying. I believe that, to some degree, Quora realizes how bad they are at this, but they consistently fail to take appropriate visible action to resolve the systemic and structural issues. Things like the lack of a representative group of black American writers, or of Indian top writers (particularly women), or the weakness of the reporting and moderation structures in place (which were gratuitously gutted by removing user moderators rather than fixing the problems that existed within the user moderator paradigm), and the ability for misuse of anon privilege to go relatively unchecked, are all issues which impact the ability of Quora to be a safe space in which to have a reasonable discussion about race.There is a very significant discussion within the TW community about the issues, particularly with the recent (June 2015) attention being paid to race issues and transgender identities in the US. We are doing what we can to help bring about better conversations, but it often feels like fighting an uphill battle, against the tide nonetheless...
