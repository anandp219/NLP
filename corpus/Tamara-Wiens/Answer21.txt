 Wear what makes you feel right and comfortable. I was presenting female outside of work for about 5 months before I came out at work, so during that period, my presentation became more androgynous, as I grew my hair out and started wearing more and more feminine touches, like clear nail polish. That worked for me, but if it doesn't work for you, then you need to find your comfort level.The reality is that transition is so very personal that no one can give you a roadmap to the entire process - the best that anyone can do is tell you what worked for them, and you can decide from there.
