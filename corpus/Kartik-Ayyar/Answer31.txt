 Birdman is a film about the struggles of Riggan Thomson ( played by Michael Keaton ), an aging actor coping with changing times. In his past, he was a star of a superhero blockbuster movie - Birdman. However, in present day times he is struggling to stay relevant as a broadway actor.I think it's a good movie that focussed on a situation many of us can relate to: when times are rough, one can't help but remember past laurels, but at the same time come to terms with how things have somehow changed.Keaton is the perfect actor to play the part given his past performance as Batman in the 80's. The movie makes great use of crossover effects between his hallucinations and reality to tell his story.As the movie progresses, his hallucinations become increasingly powerful.The movie reminded me of The Black Swan in ways. It is sometimes up to the audience to figure out what is going on.The casting has been done really well, and the acting is superb. Michael Keaton and Emma Stone in particular absolutely blew me away by their moving performances in the film. I can see why the movie critics like this move, as well, but it is somewhat of an art film rather than a really mainstream movie.Some parts of the movie are also a bit slow.All in all, I enjoyed it, though wouldn't be too excited about watching it again if presented with the chance to do so.
