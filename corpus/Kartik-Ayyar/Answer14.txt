 A lot of the other answers cite Tesla, which I agree with. The Model S has long been called an iPhone on wheels.Though subjective aspects aside, here is one chart that tells you exactly why: the product is so well branded, differentiated and aspirational that people alter their budgets by an average of 60%.70% of people who got 100K Teslas previously had cars that were far cheaper. 20% had cars that were sub 30K.It's a similar pattern to how many of the people who have iPhones previously just went for random phones.Source:Turns out, you dont have to be rich to own a Tesla
