 I have no idea what influenced design decisions in this matter, but as a general rule of thumb, most accusations around people saying that someone copied design from someone else are baseless, and even if true, are pointless.People use software all the time, particularly people who care about products, and that influences how they think.Similar classes of software, say social software, will sometimes have similar feature.The key part is that design is a means to an end to solve a problem, and the problems being solved are very different in this case, even if some of the building blocks are similar.As a user of both products, they exist to solve different problems and that's a much more important differentiator than some small widget in either of them looking similar.
