 Issues I've run into:Lack of Android Auto and Carplay integration.More generally, the lack of 3rd party SDKs for infotainment and communication.Auto pilot is great for straight freeways, though still needs refinement for a number of corner cases.The door handles can be a bit buggy - sometimes they don't retract naturally.Non next gen seats have poor back support.Issues other users complain about but I've not had problems withTiny CupholdersReliability issues ( I have not had issues, but according to consumer reports users ran into issues with earlier models. )The interior is rather minimalistic and non luxurious as compared to other options.Issues which people assume are an issue but are almost never a problem:Range anxiety.
