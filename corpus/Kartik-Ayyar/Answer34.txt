 The best Hunger Games movie so far, and very different from the first two movies. The first two were survival action movies, while Mockingjay was far closer to a war action movie. There is more drama, the characters are fleshed out far more.I particularly liked the fact that Jennifer Lawrence really gets to showcase our top notch acting talent much more so than the other movies. She's also a really good singer for one key song in the movie [ I suggest not listening to it till after you see the movie ].https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Though I felt the movie ended abruptly, and was kind of annoying how the franchise is being milked by making two movies.
