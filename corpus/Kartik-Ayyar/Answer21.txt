 I was a former paying Spotify user and happy with it for a few years, but after trying out Google Play Music for a couple of months, I made the switch for the following reasons:The basics - streaming, offline support, recommendations, playlist management, content selection, multi platform support are all there in both products.Great support for Nexus Player and Chromecast. It's very nice for broadcasting music when at a friends place.A web interface which does not use Flash, has keyboard shortcuts and is much faster. I use a Linux desktop and so this is important to me.I had more problems with Spotify and Bluetooth as compared to Google Play music. I did not diagnose why this was the case, and instead opted to go for the app which did work for me.Using Google Play Music also improves your YouTube and Google Now recommendations from what I can make out. I like how the subscription fee also disables ads for a lot of YouTube music.I have an Android tablet at home, and it's got slightly better voice integration as compared to Spotify, in terms of being able to say "play [song] by [artist] on Google Play Music".The fee is 8$, 2$ less than Spotify, which is a nice to have, but not a key driver for me.I find the social aspect of Spotify creepy and distracting more so than helpful. I want my music listening to be private and never really discovered any meaningful amount of good music through their social activity feed.Spotify had a really simple way to star songs, but they made it more complicated. You could just like star song and have it added to an auto generated playlist, but then they changed it so that you needed to add it to a playlist, and they still kept the old starred playlist - one extra level of friction for what was a simple function I liked.Note that I work at Google, but as of this writing do not directly or indirectly work on the Google products mentioned above, and made the switch based by accidentally trying out Play Music to get a YouTube Music key subscription, and finding out it was better for my needs.The only Spotify feature I really miss is the native app. Arguably, if I were not on Linux desktop for development most of the day, I might have been less likely to switch over.
