 The good parts:You get to interact and at times meet with some very smart people.You upvotes and content get more distribution.The not so good parts:The notification spam makes it much harder to use Quora:It's much, much, harder to consume content on Quora due to lots of notifications.There are some benefits, but unfortunately it comes with drowning in low signal to quality ratio notifications. I get way too many notifications of people following me, and way too many notifications of people up voting my content.These notifications make it harder to just see notifications of people writing answers about content I care about. Yes, in theory I can go to the answers tab on mobile, but in practice it's a lot of clicks.As a workaround, I have had to resort to deleting the Quora app and creating a bookmark to the answers subsection under notifications. I've not measured it in detail, but at first glance only 5% of the notifications I get about are for answers ( the primary notification type I care about ). Most notifications I get are about people following me or upvoting answers. This was sort of interesting when I was new to the site, though when you get so hundreds of notifications daily, the novelty wears of pretty quick. I have to resort to other strange behaviors to keep my notification counts lower, such as immediately unfollowing questions after answering them, and so on.
