 Programming was and still is fun.Programming contents are basically competitive sports for engineers. The programming itself was fun.It let me skip other classes in high schoolIn high school, preparing for programming contests came with the added benefit of being granted permission from my teachers to skip classes and sometimes many days of school to travel to contests in remote cities.It let me meet smart peopleI met some very smart people through programming contests. People you probably can't meet by other means.So all said no regrets.
