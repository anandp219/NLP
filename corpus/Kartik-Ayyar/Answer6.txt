 I thought the movie had great acting, but there were a few very jarring parts of the movie that didn't click for me.The movie tries to show Jobs life and relationships evolve, and how some characters are so tightly linked to him. While this is fine, the problem with the depiction is it's very unrealistic to have those people around for 3 separate product launches.The movie shows Jobs as being really good at being a huge jerk and not showing him as being much of a product guy either.There is no continuity around how he was married and had kids by the later sequences of the movie.It doesn't tell a story of the products, just that they are somehow magically built and ready to be demoed.It doesn't cover the comeback years of Apple at all, namely the iPod and iPhone years. Or for that matter Pixar. I would have expected at least some of that.If it were a pure work of fiction, I might have liked this movie - the acting is really quite good. I expected authenticity, and I did not feel I got that, which is what broke it for me.I really enjoyed The Social Network, and felt if this movie had a similar vibe, I'd like it too.However, I came out feeling disappointed.
