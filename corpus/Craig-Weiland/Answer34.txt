 Boy that's an unusual lowercase 'a'. You hardly ever see them in that style.The closest I could find is Avant Garde Gothic Condensed Medium. But the x-height is a little high compared to your example, and the letters look slightly wider. The forms seem mostly accurate (the downstroke on the k looks like it may start slightly higher than yours, but your example image isn't all that sharp so it's hard to be sure). Maybe there's another version of Avant Garde in a narrow or condensed width bouncing around out there, or it could be a cheap knockoff someone came up with.
