 Workers receive their mutually-agreed upon salary. This is what they are paid for their contribution to the company. They have no right to "demand" anything further other than what compensation was agreed upon when they took the job.Bonuses are just that: bonuses. They are paid out at the employer's pleasure (again, unless these are negotiated up frontfor most middle class workers, they are not part of the package). The appropriate response to being paid bonuses at the end of the year is "Thank you. That's money you didn't have to give me. I appreciate it."The corporate profits belong to the stakeholders. If you want to become a stakeholder in a publicly held company, you can buy stock. As a stockholder you are entitled to profits of the company. As an employee you are not.Gregory Norton's example is a very good one. When you hire a house painter, you agree to what you will pay him for what service he will provide. That arrangement does not entitle him to equity in your home nor any percentage of what discretionary income your own household budget allows you. Why would you want it to? And how is that unfair to him in any way?
