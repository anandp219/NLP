 When it comes to sports cars, if you have to ask "can I afford it?", the answer is automatically "no."60K annually is not nearly enough to justify a 65K vehicle, especially with a 1K monthly mortgage. Your driving record and credit history have no bearing on the matter.No, you can't afford it. Having a 40K nest egg is great! But that money should be working for you. Do not waste that incredible interest-bearing cash pile on something that will depreciate like a bomb. If you haven't already put most of that 40K into Roth mutual funds, you should do it immediately. The sports car will be fun for the first year or two. Then it will become part of your everyday experience, and those car payments and insurance payments will smart. Bad. Not to mention when it needs maintenance and service. You will find yourself filled with doubt over whether or not it was the right choiceand the side that says "no, it was not the right choice" will have the stronger arguments.The car will still be there when you are in better financial condition to afford it. Owning it will be a better experience, too. When it breaks down, you'll be able to afford to fix it without stressing. You won't feel the sting of those insurance payments so badly, either. Knowing it's out there in your garage, waiting for you to get in and drive it, will feel good. You won't be thinking of it out there constantly sucking down your finances, and be constantly wondering why the hell you never have any money.
