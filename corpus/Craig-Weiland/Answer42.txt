 I have two negative connotations that immediately come to mind.One is it sounds like a feminine form of "Eugene", which to me, will always be this:Grease, 1978Poor Eugene is the guy wearing the bow-tie. To me the name is synonymous with unfortunate, socially awkward, fashionably clueless. I'm sure there are plenty of great guys out there named Eugene who are anything but the character in the film shown here, but that's what I think of when presented with the name.The second connotation is more serious. "Eugenia" is strongly homophonous with eugenics, which was an excerable (yet at the time, highly fashionable) intellectual assumption that the human race would be better served by breeding out undesirable races. The name Eugenia, to me, sounds like the name of a nation-state founded on this ugly principle. I would continue to investigate other names.
