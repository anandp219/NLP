 My keyboard volume control is one of two places where I adjust my PC's audio output. It's the first place I go. Seconding what May Leong said about not wanting to tab-out of a full-screen game experience, it's just so much easier to use the hardware controls on the keyboard than it is to interrupt my game to fiddle with Windows' volume in the Start bar. I also like that my keyboard (Corsair K95) has a mute button so if I have to take a phone call or something, I can squelch the sound without any trouble.Sometimes I'm piping music through the PC via a streaming radio station. On those rarer occasions, I'll want the volume a bit higher than usual, and that's when I turn to my speakers' volume control, to crank it up a tad. This is pretty unusual since most of the time I route internet radio through a different computer (which is attached to much better speakers), but the point is sometimes I'll use the little speakers' volume knob to crank it up for a short while.But 99% of the time I use the keyboard roller and mute button to control PC volume.
