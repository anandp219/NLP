 To me it sounds like someone who is assured in their belief [in a supernatural entity] is describing someone who doesn't share their belief, in a deliberately patronizing way. They are employing a convoluted and unnecessary phrase to imply that the nonbeliever is missing something that is usually taken for granted, as in, "He lacks sight in his left eye" or "She lacks a television."While not untruethe atheist does indeed lack a belief in supernatural entitiesit is a mildly condescending turn of phrase.
