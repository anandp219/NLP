 In my opinion, she smokes because this is something the writers (the Wachowskis) used to anti-stereotype her character. Before we met the Oracle, the crew of the Neb talk about her with the deepest reverence. An expectation in the audience's mind is created, that this entitywho can seem to tell the futureis powerful, wise and intimindating. Morpheus only takes Neo to see her when he's good and ready, meaning to see the Oracle is not something one does capriciously. So the audience has some expectations of... perhaps something priestlike, or maybe like a shaman, something ancient and wise and even a little scary.No. The Great and Powerful Oracle is a mom in a kitchen, baking chocolate chip cookies."Not quite what you were expecting, right?"The Oracle is a great character. Smoking is just something she does. The questioner seems to believe that programs can't "get high", but I have two issues with this assertion: first, nowhere in the Matrix films is this established (programs are shown to enjoy sex and a great many other human pleasures, physical and emotional), and two, smoking tobacco doesn't produce a "high". Smokers smoke because they like the calming effect it has, and the flavor of it. The Oracle smokes because she feels like it. I very much doubt she worries about a cancer risk, just like I doubt the Merovingian worries about contracting an STD when he seduces random women who dine in his restaurant. They're both programs in a simulated reality, not living human beings. Even if there is a risk she might get cancer from smoking, the Oracle already knows she's not going to be around long enough to find out.
