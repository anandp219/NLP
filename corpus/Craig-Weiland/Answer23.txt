 No one is "ad immune". While web advertising offers an immediate call to action (click here!), this is only one of its purposes, a secondary purpose at best. Its primary purpose is to be seen and communicate its advertising message.As savvy Web users, our eyes are trained to ignore anything that looks like an advertisement on our Web pages. (Sometimes it's quite startling how blind people can be to user interface elements when they come too close to resembling ads.) But that doesn't mean we aren't exposed, or invulnerable to their influence. Seeing an ad in our periphery in the morning for a certain television show may prompt us to go looking for it on Netflix later in the day. Seeing an ad for Pop-Tarts somewhere in our Web surfing can tickle a "oh yeah, Pop-Tarts" idea the next time we're carting our way past them in the grocery store aisle. An ad for an expensive, trendy new Bluetooth speaker may find its way onto our Amazon wish-list at a future date.All it needs to do is find just the slightest amount of our attention, and its mission is accomplished. Many people think they are impervious to advertising and the marketing messages in ads. This is a false confidence. We may be aware of advertising all around us, and this is good, but it is foolish to claim none of it has any influence on our buying habits.
