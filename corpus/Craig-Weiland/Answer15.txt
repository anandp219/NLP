 I think it is cool. The Apple Music logo was not dependent on its choice of typeface for its recognizability.This is actually pretty generic. So it seems natural to me that Apple would liven it up with different typefaces, representing the variability in people's musical preferences. The campaign photographed in the question details makes perfect sense to me.This is the second logo I've seen that incorporates Apple's new San Francisco Compact (the first being that for the Apple Watch). It seems like a touchup of Nudista Bold to me. A lot of others are comparing it to Akkurat and Colfax. It appears Apple has finally moved on from Myriad, but still isn't so beholden to its brand new font that it can't loosen up with its usage when it suits them. I think the variability of the Apple Music logo is a fun and appropriate creative direction for them to take.
