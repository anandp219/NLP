 No. The matrix was rebooted, with a few changes made.Once Smith was purged, the Machines reloaded the matrix to allow for a few things to be changed. The Machines agreed to release people who wanted to be released, so the humans would no longer have to hack the power plants to free the minds they needed to. We can assume some in-world, "official" system was put in place to allow for this to happen.In the final scene of the film, Sati shows a colorful sunrise to the Oracle and claims she did it "for Neo." This is deliberately left unexplained, but I have a theory about Sati's role in the new matrix.But the most profound change in the new matrix is that it is built on an entirely new theory. In previous matrixes, every human is allowed to choose, at a subconscious level, whether to accept the matrix as reality. This choice inevitably results in a One to manifest, which would follow the path Neo took back to the Architect. However in this new matrix, the choice is offered to humankind overtly whether or not to remain plugged in or freed, and this untested approach may not result in a new One to emerge. In the canonical continuation of story in The Matrix Online, this did not happen before humanity and the Machines resumed hostilities again.
