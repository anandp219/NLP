 Portal (2007) and Portal 2 (2011)These brilliant games take place in a future scientific research facility (presumed to be contemporary with the Half-Life series), where an artificial intelligence system called GLaDOS has killed the humans who built and operated it and taken over the "testing" being done there. Your character, strongly hinted at being one of a large number of test subject clones, is given what's officially called the Quantum Tunneling Devicebetter known as the Portal Gunand led through a series of predesigned chambers with the objective of reaching each chamber's exit.The Portal Gun does not shoot projectiles. It creates openings in solid surfaces. Not holes, mind you, but bi-composite apertures that are wholly disconnected spatially.

Portal 2 is a fully developed triple-A first person "shooter" with incredible writing, puzzle design, environments and voice acting. The character of GLaDOS is, in my opinion, one of the most enjoyable, intriguing and flawlessly realized video game characters I've ever encountered.The Portal games have been recognized as some of the best video games ever made. Eurogamer had this to say about the series: "Portal is perfect. Portal 2 is not. It's something better than that."
