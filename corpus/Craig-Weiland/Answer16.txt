 Some excellent answers here. I have one other suggestion, which I wrote in answer to What do you do when you get tired of living?, which I will quote:Plan something.Plan something extravagant, something you've always wanted to do but never really thought you could. It can be something that may take many years to prepare for, to save up money for, to research and train for... but give yourself a goal, a realistic one, and make it a goal you really want to achieve. That will give you something you may be missing in your life: hope.Make it something that does not depend on the whims or permission of any other person. Something you do for yourself, something that touches on one of your most cherished life passionsyou know you have them.If a friend (or lover) wants to come, by all means share this with them... but it is yours, not theirs to derail and compromise with concessions to their preferences. Don't let anyone else try to force you to settle for less than your goal.When you feel depressed and alone, and feeling like there's no point to it all, remind yourself that you have a plan, you are working your plan and that someday it will be complete. Remind yourself that there is a joy ahead for you in your future, and to keep going, a day at a time, until you reach it. Don't give up on this plan... cling to it as though your life depended on it, because in a very real way, it does. Do not give up on the plan, and do not give up on yourself.Craig Weiland's answer to What do you do when you get tired of living?
