 I'm not what you would call a "typography expert" but I do use type every day, and I'm very conscious of the use of typefaces and letterforms in design.That said, I believe Apple Watch typefaces are less about typography and more about usability. For a screen that size, an interface designer is going to be less concerned with the finer details of ligature, kerning, tracking, leading and type design then s/he will with functionality and readability. Typeface selection will have to be deliberate, of course, but simple letterforms will work better in such a small display than elaborate flourishes or exaggerated serifs. I'm willing to bet most apps will rely on sans-serif fonts, to display information as concisely as possible while maintaining legibility.That's not to say that simple faces designed for small screens are unsophisticated. Anything but. Many popular faces have entire variants expressly for use on small digital screens like phones, PDAs and single-function devices like MP3 players. These will be in high demand by those designing apps for the Apple Watch.But if you're designing an interface for an app which is about the consumption of words, chances are you're going to do it in very abbreviated form on the Apple Watch. Most likely, you will use the Watch as a satellite device for the primary platform, which will be the iPhone or iPad... some other device where typographic concerns become more relevant.
