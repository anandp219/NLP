 No. The Architect does not exist inside the matrix. He is one of its creators, so he is not accessible from inside the creation except through the specific path Neo followed (into that specific building, through that specific door, using that specific key at that specific time). When Neo is standing in the white room conversing with the Architect, he is not in the matrix any longer. He is in the Machine mainframe. The only way Smith would have had any access to the Architect would be if he had already infected Neo before Neo went through the doorway. Even then, it's unknown whether the transit would have been allowed. The Keymaker specifies that only Neo can open the door using the key, implying that anyone else attempting that door with the same key would trigger the alarm. So it's reasonable to hypothesize that if Smith had overtaken Neo, and then tried the door, the alarm would have gone off and triggered the building's massive bomb.
