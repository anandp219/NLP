 Because dependence is a form of slavery.If you are dependent upon someone else for money to live, you must do what they say. They have power over you. At any time, they can cut off your money supply and if they're your only source of income, you must make sure this doesn't happen. That means you have no choice but to do what they want.Independence means no one else has that kind of power over you.I could never just accept my parents' money to support me. That would mean I'd be giving them tacit veto power over anything I wanted to do."I want to go to Kansas City this weekend to see my friend.""Oh, you're putting miles on your car just for fun? The car we still haven't paid off? We don't think that's a good idea." "I'm heading to Best Buy.""Why?""I want to buy a movie.""What movie?""Why do you want to know?""It's our money. What movie?""Uhh.... it's called Salt, mom and dad.""Oh, we've read horrible things about that movie. It's too violent. We don't think you need to be buying that."Pretty much everything can be boiled down to:"I want to buy something.""What?""Why is that your business?""Because you're spending our money on it and we want to know."No thank you. If I earn my own money, pay my own household bills, pay all my own taxes and can take care of myself without supervision, I'll go where I please, when I please, buy whatever I please and do whatever I please and I don't have to explain, justify or validate my decisions to anyone.That's what independence means.
