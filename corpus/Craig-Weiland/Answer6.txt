 Agent Smith did not die. He, along with Neo, transcended together into their next state of being.Neo and Smith are innately connected with each other. The Oracle describes Smith to Neo as such: "He is you. He is your opposite, your negative. The result of the equation trying to balance itself out." Smith's path is deeply woven into Neo's. They are inseparable.Neo knew that both he and Smith had reach their respective limitsNeo in the real world and Smith in the Matrix. Neo had penetrated the Machine City and decimated all defenses that the Machines threw at him... blindfolded. He had become undefeatable. Smith had conquered the entire Matrix, replicating himself into every avatar there until it was nothing but a city of Smiths. Neo knew that Smith could not be destroyed, but he could be removed from the Matrix by his own sacrifice. They would transcend both worlds. It was the only way to get Smith out of there.Smith was eradicated from the Matrix as Neo expired in the real world. But neither of them are dead.... it is only left unexplained what their next state of being actually was, because the Wachowskis never took the time to tell us. The films give us very strong clues, however, that neither of them are permanently dead.See: Craig Weiland's answer to What happens to Neo at the end of The Matrix Revolutions?
