 Many keyboards now have 2 USB heads. One of them is to provide power and data access for the keyboard to operate. The second is a powered pass-through for the USB port located on the keyboard itself. Some keyboards, like DAS, have multiple USB ports and USB devices require power. By providing a dedicated USB power pass-through to the computer, the USB ports do not have to leech power from the keyboard's own source.Some USB devices, like external hard drives, need a certain amount of power to operate effectively. A USB pass-through makes this possible.
