 Zero.If the song was so universally hated, Fox would have quickly figured this out and just had Whedon revise it or come up with a new one. The show involved a great deal of investment on their part, and if it had been performing well enough to maintain, simply changing the song would have been no trouble at all to do. Keeping the show on the air would have been reason enough.Numerous shows have revised their title music and opening credit sequences during their run. This is not something that gets shows cancelled in and of itself. The opening theme of Battlestar Galactica (reimagined series) was completely changed partway through the first season.Besides, there was nothing at all wrong with the title music of Firefly. It was perfectly appropriate to the visual and dramatic themes of the show. Sorry you didn't like it, but most of us fans disagree with you.
