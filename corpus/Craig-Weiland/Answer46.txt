 I don't know about "instantly in a good mood" but there is one song that somehow has insinuated itself into me in such a way that it operates like a switch. No matter how stressed, angry, upset, anxious or depressed I might be at a given point in time, if this song comes on, a switch is thrown in me that chills me out and lets me relax.The song is called "In the Waiting Line" by Zero 7.https://youtu.be/5tZlu4wP4pwSomething about this song 'resets' my inner emotional mixture and puts me in a state of mind as if it's a Sunday afternoon, with a light rain outside, nowhere to be, no deadlines to worry about... everything's ok with the world in this moment.
