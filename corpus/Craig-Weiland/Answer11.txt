 The best Apple keyboard ever made was the Apple Adjustable Keyboard.I've been using Apple keyboards since the late 80s, and this product, which debuted in 1993, is simply the finest keyboard Apple has ever come out with in my opinion.The keys are based on the same Alps mechanical keyswitches as used in the Extended Keyboard II, having perfect feel, travel and feedback. The Adjustable Keyboard was a radical design which featured a hinge in the middle, which could split the board apart down the center for ergonomic comfort. It also included generously sized palm rests on both the alphabet keyboard and the numeric keypad. Yes, it took more desktop space than others, but for those of us whose keyboards are particularly important to our comfort when using a computer for long periods, this was a negligible tradeoff.The keyboard was powered by ADB, Apple's proprietary desktop bus for peripherals.
