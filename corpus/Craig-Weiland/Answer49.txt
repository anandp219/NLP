 While I think Rob Weir's answer is probably the most practical, I think if I were somehow given knowledge (from a source I trusted) that the world was going to end tomorrow, I'd do a few things differently that day.I'd immediately drive to my parents' house. I'd want to be as close to family as I could for my remaining time. Unfortunately, I think my parents would insist on spending as much of their remaining time in church, praying. I'd join them for part of that, but I couldn't live out the rest of my life in a church.What I'd do instead is, I'd try my absolute best to get in touch with certain select people, those who have meant the most to me during my life. I'd tell them how important they were to me, and thank them.I'm not sure what else I'd do. If this were to happen before I published my first book, I'd quickly put it up on Amazon in its current (almost finished) form, just so I could die knowing I was finally a published author (a lifetime goal of mine).
