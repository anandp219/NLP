 For what it's worth, I grew up in the northern suburbs of St. Louis when it was still relatively crime-free and safe. We always locked the car, and we always locked doors and windows. It was just the prudent thing to do.However many of my friends grew up in more rural places in the state, and they still do not lock their cars... usually they're either at home, where they feel safe, or at work, where their cars are pretty safe in the office parking lot.Now I live in a much smaller city, but I still keep my old habit of keeing it locked wherever I am. My house's front door is always locked, even when I am home. My car doors are locked no matter if I'm at home or elsewhere. In my neighborhood, it's not uncommon that crooks cruise parking lots at night and help themselves to whatever they might find stashed in unlocked parked cars. They got me once when I (quite accidentally) left my car unlocked overnight. Fortunately they didn't take anything of real value, since I don't keep anything of real value in the car that they may have wanted. But it was a worthwhile reminder to always keep my car locked up.Today I keep my car secured in a garage when I'm at home, and I still lock it up when it's in there. No sense falling out of habit.
