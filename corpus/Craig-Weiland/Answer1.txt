 In a physical confrontation, Bond. No question.Bond has training, years of experience, larger body mass and much more strength. If you've seen any of the recent Bond films (Casino Royale and later) Bond is shown as an explosive weapon with a very short fuse. When attacked, he becomes a fury of pure instinctual lethality and does not stop until his opponent is dead. Sometimes he kills so fast I wonder if he even did it on purpose (Edmund Slate in Quantum of Solace, for example).Poor Lisbeth would be toast in under 10 seconds.
