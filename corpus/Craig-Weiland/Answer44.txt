 It is just as ethical for them to lay you off as it is for you to quit.A job is a business arrangement. You agree to provide your time, skills, labor, talent, etc. (to a certain limited extent), and they agree to pay you money. So long as this arrangement is mutually beneficial, to both parties, it stands. When either partyyou or the companydecides they are better off changing it, then they have every right to do so.Contrary to many people's belief, companies do not exist to provide jobs. They exist to provide value to society through their products and services, and generate profit while doing so (the profit is what makes the provided value worth producing). They are not charities designed to give people incomes and health benefits. Of course many companies take very good care of their employeesmine doesbut ultimately I would not feel like I've "wronged" my employer if I were offered a more lucrative job elsewhere and then resigned to take it.I would feel sad to be leaving my co-workers, which would have to factor into my taking another job elsewhere... it would have to be a pretty good offer to make me want to give that up. But I know not one of them would feel like I'd done anything ethically wrong.
