 Their parents' perspective.Often when a teenager will want something or want to do something and the parent will deny it to them, the teen will get angry. "Why can't I [have it]?" they ask. The parents' response often comes in the form of, "Because I said so."This is infuriating to the teen. The teen knows only their own personal experience and the short-term need that the thing they want will address. They are incapable of seeing a bigger picture, one that includes not only this short-term thing but the possible long-term ramifications of it or various possible unintended consequences that stem from it. This perspective is completely foreign to them so they don't understand that it even exists.And most parents aren't even aware that this is the basis for their parenting decisions in many cases. They know that X behavior could lead to possible Y bad consequences and they don't want that for their children, so X behavior is just off limits. But the reason they know that is because they have a few more decades of life experience of their own, and they have a more seasoned view of how the world works than their children do because they have a more mature way of looking at the world. They have a broad life perspective. Teenagers have a very, very narrow one.But you can't communicate this to most teenagers. Their needs are immediate and they cannot see past them into a possible context that isn't in their long-term interests. They are like the proverbial mouse in the maze. From their point of view, life is a series of simple choices: what turn to make next. Parents are seeing much more of the maze their children are navigating and can more effectively guide them toward positive outcomes, even if it seems contradictory to their children's short-term priorities of the moment.
