 Aston Martin, BMW and Lotus in the James Bond movies.James Bond films are particularly notorious for their product placement of vehicles. Each actor who's played Bond has a particular make of car associated with him, as contracts to supply cars are made over a multiple-movie run (as in, "BMW will supply cars for the next three Bond films").Sean Connery of course is associated with his classic Aston Martin:(Goldfinger, 1964)Roger Moore drove Lotus in many of his Bond films:(For Your Eyes Only, 1981)Aston Martin returned to the franchise with Timothy Dalton:(The Living Daylights, 1987)Pierce Brosnon's Bond was fond of BMWs:(The World Is Not Enough, 1999)And Aston Martin once again took its place as Bond's go-to car in the Daniel Craig era:(Casino Royale, 2006)SUVs in Jurassic Park & The Lost World(Jurassic Park, 1993)In 1993, the sport-utility vehicle was still a pretty new product segment. Most people associated the body style with the venerable Jeep Cherokee, which was not particularly trendy and was owned mainly by people who actually took it off-road. The Explorer was a risky venture for Ford at the time of its release in 1990, and Jurassic Park was a perfect vehiclepardon the punto promote it to the world. (Note that the vehicle does a pretty admirable job protecting its occupants from the T-Rex attack.)Due to the Ford's success with the first film, Mercedes Benz took a page from their playbook and hooked up with The Lost World to introduce their brand new GL SUV in 1997.(The Lost World, 1997)I think it's amusing to point out that the GL didn't do quite as good of a job protecting its occupant from the T-Rex attack. To be fair, though, there were two of them this time.
