 While it may be educational to be around someone who knows a lot of information, history, or knowledge in general, it can paradoxically also be very dull.A know it all is dull when he interjects his knowledge (as he knows it) into a conversation or situation that does not necessarily welcome it. It can be tedious to listen to, rather than enlightening, spacious, or fascinating. There is a quality that leaves an unwanted impression, as opposed to the smart person who speaks and shares the right thing at the right time.What is dull? The loss of presence to those around him coupled with a lack of room for creating conversation in a mutually satisfying way. In essence, when we know too much and don't give a damn how it affects others, we become out of sync, out of harmony. And the possibility of embracing the unknown dries up. There is nothing wrong with knowing alot but like anything, if it is used for selfish reasons, receptivity to the knower will be devalued and his (or her) superiority will usually get shunned.
