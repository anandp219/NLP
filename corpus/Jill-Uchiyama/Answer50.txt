 I've got a great book for you: the life-changing magic of tidying up by Marie Kondo. Her book has become a huge hit and is a NY Times #1 bestseller. My friend told me that it's a sensation over there in the Bay area where you are.The premise is simple and helps you clearly decide what you are going to keep rather than what you are going to throw away. The first section in the book is all about clothes, specifically.I'll summarize her very easy method to save you the $7 on Kindle: put all of your clothes on the floor -everything, even your underwear. Sit by the pile with a glass of white wine (ok, I added that part in). Pick up one item at a time and hold it in your hands. Ask yourself, "Does this give me joy?"If it doesn't, discard it. If it does, keep it.By the end, you may have quite a big pile to discard- and that will be your answer. The rest will truly be clothes that you love- and only ones that you love. You can't go wrong!
