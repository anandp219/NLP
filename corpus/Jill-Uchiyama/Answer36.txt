 You are the most important person in the world.What this refers to is the importance you hold in taking yourself seriously, knowing that you are the chooser and the only one able to map out your life with each footstep, with each decision. Once you become an adult it all falls on you. You have to continue to question yourself and the direction you are going, because if you decide not to take a direction- the world and everyone in it- all the forces at work- will choose one for you.Being the most important person in the world requires the willingness to really be here. Many people are not so sure they even want to be alive, but the fact is, we are alive. As long as you are alive, you are the most important person. You hold the joystick. You direct the vessel.Humility is requested. Being the most important person in the world means that you are given a gift. As long as there is even 1% possibility of free will to make choice, you have access to the power of directionality, of evolution. You get to create a life, play a hand, roll the die and be rolled all in one. As the most important person, you have the capacity to find happiness within you, if you dare. You have the right to get rid of everything that you are not, and begin to eliminate falsehood from your being. The more in harmony with the truth you become of who you are, the more happiness can emerge because you fall deeply in touch with your own true self. When you step into the shoes of the most important person that you are, your whole relationship to life will take on a new dimension. Some call it the power of now. Some call it the here and now. It is a perspective that will bring you to a sobriety about life and all that falls into the potential of your being a conscious, human part of it. This is a huge lesson- and an experience that is worth knowing.
