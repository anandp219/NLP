 Accept reality. Put down your idealizations about a particular person, job, situation, relationship, bow your head and accept that life does not always work out on your terms.Letting go is the same thing as accepting reality. This is why meditation is sometimes simple, sometimes impossible practice. It is hard to let things be when we have a stake in the outcome, when we are attached to our ideals. Sometimes you just have to accept losing people, opportunities, things, money, time, and health. And even as I write this, something rages up inside of me that screams, "NO!!!"
