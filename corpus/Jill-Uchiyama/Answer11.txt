 It goes back to tribes. And luckily now that we have DNA websites which allow us to find out what haplogroups we belong to, we can now know what our original tribes were. This is where things get really interesting for us: finding out where we originated.You see, I do not think this is just a Caucasian American thing, but a human thing. Americans may be more prone to wanting to find out because our country is so young, and because our lineages are much vaster than we ever thought. Knowing what nationalities you belong to is a right. This isn't easy for certain races such as African Americans, who may never trace back their heritage because their lines have been cut by forced migration and slavery. Luckily with DNA testing, there is hope. And now many more people are able to know not only where they came from 200 years ago, but thousands. When this catches on to other groups of people in the world, it has the potential to revolutionize how people see themselves- as not just belonging to a country or a region, but to the entire world.
