 I don't think it's normal to be oriented only toward suffering or pain as a goal, and yet, I agree that suffering is a necessary part of life in order to grow and evolve.Evolution takes struggle, it does not come without some form of pain, whether it be stretching to move forward, working hard, or picking oneself up after a personal devastation.Happiness serves a purpose too. It is just as important as suffering. Where suffering is the temperature gauge that tells you when something is really off about a situation, people, or attitude in oneself- happiness is the full tank of gas that allows for life to flow lovingly along. Happiness is a state of being. It is a birthright. It doesn't just come along superficially. Happiness also, demands respect. It is the state in which life and the cosmos comes alive. It is a beautiful state, and it reminds us of the preciousness of life and how truly good life can be.So respect your pain and your happiness. Both are part of this interesting path in life and both serve a purpose.
