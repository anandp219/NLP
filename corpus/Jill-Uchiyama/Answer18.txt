 If you think about it, it is not necessary to love oneself in order to be in love. Many people claim to be in love if you consider how many things this means. We do not have to love ourselves in order to feel the desire to be rescued from loneliness, for example. We do not have respect ourselves in order to experience sexual attraction. We do not have to treat ourselves well in order dream about a perfect world with another.But if you asked the question, "Is it possible for us to fully partner, care for, love, and commit to another human being if one does not love oneself," my answer would be, "no."There is a huge difference between the feeling of being in love and what it means to be truly loving. Being in love serves the function in bringing two people together and forming a bond. As powerful as it feels and even as all encompassing as it is, being in love, the state of it, is really not that deep. It is not attached to morality. It isn't associated with being a good partner, a peaceful person. This is why it is so easy for people to fall in love but much much more difficult to stay connected and committed. And so, loving oneself or even hating oneself is irrelevant- because it has nothing to do with a self possessed, conscious form of behaving morally, truthfully, faithfully, or bestowing goodness upon your beloved.On the other hand, truly staying loving, committed, and acting in the best possible way on behalf of your beloved, requires great love for oneself. When we love ourselves, when we respect ourselves, and when we care about how to conduct ourselves as fully loving people, we must know firsthand what that means, and above all else, value it. Even if we are full of unconscious holes, or conditioning, or have had pain inflicted upon us, we must have some basis for knowing what loving behavior is and therefore, have some kind of connection to it. So many people seem to have that foundation but have not yet learned how to fully love themselves throughout all circumstances, and so there are gaps in what we value and how we react and behave.So on one hand, we must have that core in order to be fully loving, and on the other, rarely does an individual have a complete sense of self-love - in the healthiest and highest sense of the word. In essence, we are all a work in progress on the continuum of becoming self loving and loving others.
