 It's like waiting for Godot.I spent many years attempting to lose my small self. I had many powerful experiences but none lasted indefinitely. Still, I was expecting that at some point in time I would just be there.. on the other side of my ego, in a spaceless, timeless, state of consciousness that would last.Even though that moment never came, I learned one important thing: if you have had even one glimpse into that world- just one taste- that's enough for a lifetime. And so, over time, I gave up on that endeavor and carried the memories of all of my experiences with me- for whenever I needed to recall how beautiful, how free, how ultimately positive- the nature of life really is.
