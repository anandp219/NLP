 Being self- possessed, that is knowing yourself.Happiness is a mood for some, and a state of being for others. The state of being is intrinsic to being free enough to face who you are on a deep level. It allows for truth and authenticity to be felt and known. The more you can let go of the ego's false impressions that masks our true selves, the more freedom is felt. In this way, happiness is not a passing feeling that is based on lucky circumstances, it becomes who we are the more we go into who we are- both psychologically and spiritually.Know yourself, face yourself, and then you can be free to know nothing. That is the best kind of happiness- and it's a byproduct of authenticity, trusting life, and giving up all that you are not.
