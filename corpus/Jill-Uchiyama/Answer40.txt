 It's possible that it is just a bunch of people jumping on another bandwagon, or it could be a collective cry from people who witnessed some excruciatingly hateful behavior on the part of our human race. Maybe there are just hoards of us that are really sorry about this. It's not just about a lion. It's a loaded event. It's white privilege in the form of a U.S. dentist who goes to another continent to live out his dream of slaying a lion. It's about the indecency and brutality of the human who cares more about his own ego than about what is true, beautiful, and awe-inspiring.It is about the anguish in hearing how an innocent animal was coerced by such an evil intention, and how the human brain manipulated an animal in his own habitat for the purpose of hunting it down and killing it.It is about the inhumanity of those who participated in injuring Cecil and then finally killing him, burning him, decapitating him... is this enough? Do you get why so many people are dying over this?The only good thing that comes from this story is that bandwagon of millions of people who feel this pain, who shudder at the site of Cecil's beautiful form when they see his videos, who have felt sick about this atrocity. Apparently, this story cuts close to the bone for many people. It's a lion. A beautiful animal who had a story. Most humans have respect and awe for such an animal.Human atrocities are also real and up front in the media. Caring about Cecil's death does not negate caring about other serious topics of the day. It just hurts, is all.
