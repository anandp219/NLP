 My advice is do it. Take the position in Thailand if that suits you better.As someone who has also chosen the helping professions over making money, as well as living abroad in different places- you cannot change your own mind if this is the path that makes the most sense to you.I did it this way and even dedicated a decade of my life to experimenting in a spiritual community that I wholeheartedly believed in. My aspirations have always been lofty and, perhaps, over the top. To be sure, they have never been mundane.But as I stand on my 47th birthday today, I will tell you, there is a price to pay for this nomadic life. If you want to live freely and help people around the world, great, but don't deny the practical aspects of needing to build something for yourself on the material plane.Money, while it is not everything, is something. If you spend all of your money and time as a young person and do not put anything away for yourself, you will need to catch up like hell when you get to be my age. That is what I'm doing now, and it's definitely put a kink in my "live and let live" lifestyle. I do not regret any of the decisions I made and the ways I spent my time and money as young adult. But some day, you will need to take stock of what you have built and may find yourself looking around at friends who all have done the "mundane" thing- and they have much more built than you do.Nothing can replace the experiences you have in your lifetime. Just continue to plan smartly. That's my advice.
