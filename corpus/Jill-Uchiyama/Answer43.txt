 This is funny! I consulted my brilliant team of Master's level English language teachers and there was some disagreement and some hard feelings. Basically when you use the present perfect tense it brings the past into the present. It has a subtle feeling of doing this. And basically when you use the past, it has a feeling of being, well, just in the past.In this example, however, there is no difference and both are grammatically correct. The word "before" is what equalizes these two sentence structures.
