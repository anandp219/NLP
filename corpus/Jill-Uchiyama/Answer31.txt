 Learn how to self-partner, to live life as a full, whole human being, instead of a victim.Most people have been hurt and wounded during the course of their childhoods or young adulthoods. We've been privy to loved ones with addictions, lying, betrayal, gross insensitivity, and so much more. It's just a fact that no one gets out of life unscathed. We're human beings, we injure. We're a rude lot. We're gross. And yet..It is possible to not fall into victimization for life. And if you can learn how to self-partner, you'll be on your way. Learning the skill and orientation of how to heal your own wounds can lead you to a very different life. The question is, how conscious do you want to be?This takes work. It takes openness. It requires the willingness to leave the victim behind. To stop blaming the world for your pain and begin to heal yourself so that you can live a completely different orientation to life.Thriving is when life really begins. Everything up until that is painful drudgery with moments of happiness. I believe if everyone were taught this at an early age- this incredible skill of how to self-partner, our lives would be beyond our dreams. We'd have wings to really go somewhere in our lifetime.
