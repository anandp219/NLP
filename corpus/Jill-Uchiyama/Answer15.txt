 It doesn't matter whether you are fixated on the past, present, or future. What matters is your relationship to your thoughts. One of the functions of ego is a really nasty drone inside of ourselves that basically says, "Something is wrong. Something is missing. Something stinks." It is a faint voice that continually drones on and on. Some people, when they get into a meditative practice can begin to hear that voice and objectify it. This is part of the purpose of meditation- to objectify and get some perspective on the crazy thoughts, and emerging feelings that seemingly well up out of the blue.Once you recognize that you are not those crazy thoughts, that ego, there is room for more liberation inside of you. There is space to breath and in that, the objectification of those thoughts- such as referring to the past- will begin to diminish in importance.This is really the big lesson: you want to diminish the importance of those thoughts, not necessarily get rid of them (which may not be possible anyway). So the goal is not to just live in the present- it's to develop a positive relationship to your thoughts, whether they are negative in nature or not. To be untouched by them, really, and not to be victimized by them. That's power. And that is so so possible to those who truly want to develop a healthy relationship to thought.
