 Generally speaking, no. The purpose of a secret is to conceal a fact or truth. The purpose of concealing is because you suspect your partner won't like or be able to tolerate that truth.There is a period of time when two people are getting to know each other. During that period, there will be all kinds of things that they don't know about each other, all kinds of secrets you could say. As they get to know one another, sharing those stories and becoming closer and more intimate is a special kind of process. It requires trust and honesty about one's life. Discretion is important, and there is a time and place to share something that may be difficult, or very personal. But one would hope he/she could share most anything.In this way, a couple will become closer and more intimate over time and though they may not know everything about each other, they won't be intentionally holding on to certain aspects of their lives that they are unwilling to share.
