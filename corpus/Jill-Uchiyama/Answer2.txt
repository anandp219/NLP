 Otaru in Hokkaido prefecture is a city about 40 minutes by train northwest of Sapporo. It is known as the most romantic city in Japan, characterized by a man made canal lined with warehouses which contain beautiful glass, art museums, and the largest collection of music boxes in Japan. This fairy tale city is brought to "light" not only through its famous glassware, but the city's landscape is illuminated inside and out through keresene lights which glow all along the canal as well as inside some of the most mood-oriented eateries in Japan.Shopping for glassware is one of the most enjoyable treats and Otaru offers plenty of incredible designs for the home.It is also known for its music box museum which houses over 25,000 beautiful glass music boxes. For an extravagantly interesting experience, go have a beer at Kitaichi Hall located in the glass building. This captures the mood and feeling of Otaru so well- dreamy and romantic.Otaru offers the best of what other great cities offer in Japan, with the flair of Hokkaido style, weather, and cuisine. In one of the coldest areas of Japan, it is perfect as a snowy backdrop to the otherwise humid Honshu island, or a beautiful way to cool off during a visit in the summer. A must see!
