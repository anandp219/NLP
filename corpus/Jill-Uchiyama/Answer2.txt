 We've all had those days when we feel like the world is conspiring to keep us down, as if we're in jello or some sticky substance that holds us back from getting things done. Those days when things break down- when the toast gets burnt at breakfast, or we spill our coffee on our report. Maybe it's one of those days that we are in a fight with a loved one, or someone takes it out on us. A stranger on the subway yells at you. From there on, it seems it's one calamity after another.On days when things don't go our way, we can feel like we're in a bad movie- like life has its own agenda for us which is to cause things that don't normally dysfunction, to do so with full force.It's days like those that we might believe we have no access to choice or even free will. Like all of our moves just play out in some big story that we have no dominion over. So what do you do on days like this? When you think there is no hope for turning it around?Look at the sun. Look at the moon. Look at a friend. Gaze at a body of water. Look at the leaves blowing. Search for the face of an animal. Anything natural will do. Just look at it, intently, for a while. Let its energy carry you away a little. Let it wash over you with something warm, something simple, something that feels right. And as you look at this lovely thing, this piece of nature, let your mind be still for once today, on this day where nothing seems to be going the right way. Just still it as you meditate upon this piece of nature, this work of art that is your friend, or that sun- whatever. And then tell yourself these words, "It stops here because I say so." And to seal the deal, look some more- until you are ready to start your new day. No matter how bad things seem, it doesn't get to be bad unless we allow it to. There is always more room for an attitude of positivity- a position of lightness (not denial) -even on the worst days.
