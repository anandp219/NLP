 The path and the goal are one.The minute you make room for anything out of the ordinary to occur, the second you get out of the way from your mundane way of life- you open yourself up for anything to happen. Dreaming of that which is possible, which seems impossible- making that dream or goal or whatever it is conscious- is the start of your path.The American actor who played Superman, Christopher Reeve, dreamt of walking again after a terrible horse riding accident left him paralyzed in all four quadrants of his body. He put everything he had behind doing what everyone thought was an impossible act- to walk. Every time you break a personal record, or do something you have never done before, you are setting your own personal records. And some people, will set records for the human race. Thus, a blind man decides to climb Mt. Everest- and he does it. A man with no legs decides to ride across Ghana- and he does it. A fat person decides to walk across the United States- and she does it. Whatever your impossible dream is- you put yourself on the path toward it just by letting it in, letting it take over your heart. You may find yourself walking in a whole new body, new life, new world. That is what is so extraordinary about being human. We can do this.
