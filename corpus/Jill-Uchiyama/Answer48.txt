 Yes. I did although my mother and I aren't even biologically related (I'm adopted).I was so excited about my results from 23andMe that as I shared them with my mother, she began to get excited too. Specifically, she was interested in the ancestry part and had wondered if the family rumor that one of her grandmothers had Native American blood was true or not. When I shared with her about all of the biological cousins I was finding, she was also intrigued. Now, my mother is not computer literate, so she gave me full permission to take care of her account. This was about 3 years ago. She signed up, received the kit in the mail, sent it back and waited.When the results came, I was the first to see them, naturally. I gathered everything on paper for her so she could refer to the data when she wanted to look at it again. And later, I'd just bring my laptop to her home and we'd sit around and look at her profile. For someone who is not a "science" person, my mother really enjoyed 23andMe and learned a few things about her health (still allowed at that time) too. I'm so glad she did this because her grandchildren who are biologically related to her will have that record at their access (through me). What a precious gift!
