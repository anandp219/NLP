 Someone who becomes part of your brain, literally. You get this person. They get you. They know you deeply. You know them deeply. In fact, even if you have separate lives, separate partners, separate jobs, and live in separate cities- when you get together with this person- you just feel you are with yourself in some way. A good friend makes you feel that comfortable. As if you are with yourself in the best way. Their company is like a warm coat on a chilly day, a small breeze on the ocean, a wink from a blinking evening star. This friend, your friend, lives inside of you- at some point along the way, and it's hard to define when- you really merged into one luscious person. Your good friend is not someone you have to explain much to- they already internalize your life's story. They get it. It's like they become a song in your head- one that you know the lyrics to- one that you pull out and play again and again. There is trust. There is celebration when good things come their way. They are on FB liking all of the important posts and pushing you to break up with that jerk that's treating you wrong- all the while understanding your feelings and needs.The good friend is like nothing else in life. In the hardest of times, you'll see. They'll be there to give you a sense of what is important in this world, why it's important to keep going. This one is for you my dear, dear friends. Luckily, I have many to keep me remembering who I am and to stick to in a life that is otherwise so undefined.
