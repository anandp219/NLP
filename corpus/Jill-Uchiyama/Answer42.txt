 When you really are meditating, you are in a timeless state. That is why many people who are deeply resting in a meditative place can sit for potentially hours and not know it.Because time is non-existent in the deepest place of letting go, there is no attachment or bondage to the minutes and hours. That is how many who have gone off the grid to meditate somewhere for years on end are able to do this. It is a powerful place.If you are sleeping, that is something different. You also lose a sense of time when you are asleep, but it is important not to confuse this with the meditative state. Sleeping is not the same as meditating even though you can lose all trace of time in both.If you are sleeping, you may just want to try a shorter meditation and see if you can stay alert and awake for the whole time. Also, try to set a soft bell or alarm at the end of your meditation so you do not fall asleep and go over the hour. There are some great apps (such as Insight Timer)that can provide singing bowls and they make great alarms at the end of the session.
