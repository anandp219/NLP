 That which you are seeking is causing you to seek.There are many paths to the inner world and you are already on one by asking this question. How can you be separate from spirit or your own true self, and not know about it? In many cultures which focus on materialism, we have never been taught how to develop spiritually. The fact that you are interested in finding out how to develop spiritually means that you are ready to consciously develop spiritually. Your consciousness has expanded to include spiritual development which is very different from other forms of development such as cognitive, emotional, physical, or financial development. Spiritual development is specifically, something else entirely.So you develop spiritually by continuing to put attention onto your questions, your inquiry. Seek after what pulls you forward. Contemplate what you think about spiritual development. Look at what others have to say about it- read, try a practice that you are drawn to- whatever speaks to you, draws you in, interests you above all else, man, do it.
