 Being adopted, I was very much like you. I had no access to my past beyond just a few ideas which were passed along to me by my parents. I had no real idea what my ethnic background was for sure, and certainly knew nothing beyond what my biological parents were rumored to be. Then came 23andMe- Time Magazine's "Best Invention of 2008". I was first introduced to this life-changing website and testing service through an article written by Steven Pinker (The Language Instinct) at Harvard. I read his experience of doing 23andMe in a published article in the Boston Globe about 6 years ago. Your saliva puts you on the map. For a small amount of money (these days), you can get tested and 23andMe will illuminate your DNA history in a way that nothing else can. I had no knowledge of my ancestry and now know more than I could ever have imagined. The test allows you to peer back- 40,000 years into your distant past- where your haplogroup which is a distinct set of people who share the same DNA as you do, originated. You will find out what your haplogroups are, where your origins come from, and you will probably, like many of us, be surprised by the findings.I highly recommend this. It has the capacity to connect you to your past and present in ways that are beyond your dreams. Here is the breakdown of an ancestry profile on 23andMe:
