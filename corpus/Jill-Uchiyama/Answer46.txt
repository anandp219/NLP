 It depends on the argument. In some cases, it is obvious which side is right.If it is not obvious, then either both sides are posing a similar position with a different angle, and/or are not hitting the mark entirely.There is a way of hearing something as truer than something else- and that could be construed as being "more right". Usually the truer argument is the one that embraces a bigger view than the less truer argument. It encompasses more of reality, more angles, a higher (if you will) perspective.Other times it is the side which is the least complicated and clear that wins the argument. Whatever you decide, it is really interesting to try to decipher! Have fun with it and enjoy the challenge!
