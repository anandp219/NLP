 If there is any confusion around whether Japanese people love golf, look no further. They do. They really do. And while many of my Japanese students would cite "golf" as one of their hobbies, the golf craze in Japan means much more than your general stamp collecting way to pass the time.Golf in Japan is a form of status. To have a golf membership at one of the countries' 2500 courses (the highest number of all Asian countries put together) is a form of financial success and social status.In my brief married life, my Japanese family actually took me to their golf resort which included a posh onsen, hotel and spa. It was more than golf. It was a spendid vacation and we were pampered to the nth degree. Having grown up with golf in my family (my father was caddy master at the local golf course down the street from my high school), I myself grew up on the golf courses in Indiana. No big woop. It was kinda fun. Not my thing. Boring, yet serene. I liked riding the golf carts.But my Japanese family. Whoa. Where my father paid less than a couple of Lincolns in the 80's to play golf down the road, my father-in-law boasted a $100,000 membership at his resort. I taught hundreds of Japanese people and based on more than dozens of conversations, the topic of golf came up frequently. In fact, I used to debate with my male students (in particular) as to why golf was so riveting to them as I have always found it boring.What I heard, time and time again, was first the expense of playing golf in Japan. It cost (as of the late 90's) around $300 to even get on a golf course. This is exponentially higher than in other countries. Check out this article in the New York Times written in the 80's. Want to Play Golf in Japan? Got a Million?So the reason why golf is so popular in Japan, is, prestige. Apparently you get to be somebody in a country where everyone is supposed to blend together.
