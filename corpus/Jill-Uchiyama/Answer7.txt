 Even if people say they don't believe in ghosts, they would probably not want to get anywhere near a so-called haunted locale. Some people who say they don't believe in anything supernatural, paranormal, or even spiritual, are actually terrified of anything that is not logical or rationally based. Most people are easily spooked and that sensation does not come from the logical part of the brain. A friend of mine, Gerard Senehi, used to do shows for people that would scare the hell out of them. He moved objects without touching them, bent spoons by just twirling them, and levitated cigarettes and other objects. He was good. Really good at this.I was at several of his shows and he would literally scare people some people to death. His shows defied all reason and logical thinking. They were filled to the brim of acts that would make the hair on your arm stand up. And some of his so-called tricks were so elaborate, no one could figure out how he did it without having some kind of special powers.I witnessed people actually get angry during his show and run out the door. In part I think anything that challenges our logical brain and reasoning is a threat to our very own existence. Some people can accept that kind of mystery, others simply cannot.
