 I had the experience of being an American working abroad in London and Tokyo- totally different times, and different jobs. Here are my own notable comparisons:Both Londoners and Tokyoites are shy, reserved people. Neither make eye contact on trains very often.London offers Beatles walking tours. Tokyo has the John Lennon museum.Both cities drive in the right side of the car and on the left side of the road.In London, my English was frowned upon. In Tokyo, my English was valued and cherished. In both cities, I worked with English speaking people from all over the world- Australians, Canadians, New Zealanders, Irish, British, Indians, and other Americans. During the years I worked in London, the pound doubled my dollar. In Tokyo, the dollar nearly doubled my yen.In terms of diversity, it is hard to say which is more diverse. Tokyo has a replica of the Eiffel Tower. London has... well.. Big Ben. For the best food in Tokyo, go Japanese. For the best food in London, go Japanese (or Indian).In London, rioting on the streets helped remove Magaret Thatcher. In Tokyo, rioting is not necessary due to professional suicide.In both London and Tokyo people regularly get pissed drunk. In Tokyo, men piss on the street. In London, people piss off.In London, it was common to drink after work. In Tokyo, drinking is expected during work. The weirdest thing that happened to me in Tokyo was being groped on a crowded train. In London, it was a bomb threat- next door to my office building. Either way, I was nearly screwed.Both London and Tokyo can feel like enormous, overwhelmingly lonely places. London has cathedrals, and Tokyo has temples and shrines. Neither are particularly religious places.But the best part for a lonely American working abroad in either London or Tokyo... both have Hard Rock Cafes which serve Thanksgiving dinner every year.
