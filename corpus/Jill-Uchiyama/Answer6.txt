 Kindness and selflessness are not designed to make you happy in every way. Striving to be a good person does not necessarily make one happy. It doesn't keep you company through the night. It doesn't pay your bills. It doesn't wake you in the morning with a kiss and a cup of coffee. It doesn't comfort you when you are hurting or when someone is angry, hurtful toward you. It doesn't guarantee you anything in life that is material. But what it does do, if you strive to live such a life, is it gives you peace of mind. You do not wake up in the middle of the night sweating over causing another person's pain. You do not feel that knot in your stomach because you were a jerk yesterday and hurt your mother, or your brother, or you friends, or your lover. You get to feel relaxed around your very own instincts over time, because you begin to trust your own deepest motives. You know that if anyone in your life dies today, your last interaction with them was clean, loving, and kind. You know that if you die today, that all of your interactions are exactly what you wanted them to be. You are not unnecessarily torturing someone, withholding, or leaving them with guilt or shame. You stand for peace. And when there cannot be peace, you stand for kindness. Not a bad way to live a life. The payoffs are invisible, but enormous.
