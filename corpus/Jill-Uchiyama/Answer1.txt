 Perhaps it will be the book that you end up writing.Cheryl Strayed wrote her memoirs while hiking 1000 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail in California. She certainly had her problems including drug addiction, grief over losing her mother, and marital problems. Her decision to walk across California came from a deep need to change her life- to find out what is on the other side, beyond her limits. It's an amazing story, and we all have one. Some are kept in the privacy of our own memories, or between lovers. But your life is the most amazing book that is unfolding- and you are the center of it as well as the creator. When you decide to cash in for your gold, and do whatever that may take, you will have a beautiful human story to tell too. It's all yours.I'd finally come to understand what it had been: a yearning for a way out, when actually what I had wanted to find was a way in.
