 Japanese and Western food is about as different as night and day. And I would make an all important distinction between "Western" and "American" for the fact that Americanized food from any country is different (except for Greek, which is unusually similar). Talk to any group of people, in fact, and they will say there is a big difference between their countries' food and Americanized versions of it. I heard countless opinions on Western food from my students and Japanese family. Here are some highlights:1. American food is too sweet. All of it. Not just desserts.2. American steak is too thick and heavy. Hamburgers included.3. The portions are laughably much too big. One big American helping would serve about 4 people in Japan as a share.4. American desserts are ridiculously sweet and barely edible.5. There is too much fat in Western food in general. Japanese people are generally not big fans of cheese, so anything with cheese or cream in it becomes automatically an issue.6. American coffee is too watery.7. English and German food is not well liked by Japanese which includes heavy baked dishes, french fries, and baked beans. 8. Our salad dressings are pretty nasty for Japanese tastebuds. Particularly the creamy ones.9. Western style sushi is totally off and not the same as Japanese sushi. We don't get the rice right.10. The flavors we choose for potato chips are completely different than what Japanese choose. For example, salt and vinegar versus soy sauce and butter flavor. 11. American chocolate is too sweet. And chocolate for breakfast is unheard of in Japan.12. Sesame is a huge staple in Japanese cooking and it is almost unheard of in Western cooking. 13. Lastly, we don't offer nice hot towels at the beginning of our meal.
