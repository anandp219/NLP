 the juice and the tea were added in the kettle during the whirlpool (after the boil) for maximum flavor and aroma contribution. The Pear fruit complexity pierces right through the spicy Czech Saaz hops beautifully, adding a gentle acidity to this pale lager that makes for a crisp refreshing sipper. Amarillo hops add nuanced citrus notes that meld perfectly with the fruit. DoppelbockSamichlaus Classic Bier - Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg (Austria)Image via Eggenberger Samichlaus ClassicDescription:The once strongest beer in the world is back ! Brewed only once a year on December 6. Samichlaus is aged for 10 months before bottling. This beer is perhaps the rarest in the world. Samichlaus may be aged for many years to come. Older vintages become more complex with a creamy warming finish. Serve with hardy robust dishes and desserts, particulary with chocolates, or as an after dinner drink by itself. Brewed under the exclusive licence of Feldschlsschen-Hrlimann-Holding, Switzerland.*Alternate: Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock - Privatbrauerei Franz Inselkammer KG / Brauerei AyingSaison / Farmhouse Ale Saison Dupont - Brasserie Dupont sprl (Belgium) Image via Les Coureurs des Boires: mai 2012 A slightly cloudy yellow-colored ale with high carbonation, fruity and spicy aromas and tastes, and perceptible, somewhat quinine-like bitterness. Brewed in the Saison style from Pilsner malt and Kent Goldings and Styrian Goldings hops. Originally titled "Saison Vielle Provision", the beer was also dry-hopped until the brewery stopped this practice in favor of a larger late hop addition in the boil. Unfiltered and bottle-conditioned, Saison Dupont is packaged in green glass bottles of a thickness appropriate to withstand the substantial carbonation. The bottles are finished with a champagne-style cork and wire cage.Old AleTheakston Old Peculier - T & R Theakston Ltd. (England, United Kingdom)Image via The Br Rev - Theakston Old Peculier The brewery describes this beer as:Old Peculier is a beautiful, yet very simple beer, brewed using a very generous blend of finest pale, crystal and roasted barley with two bitter hops combined with the majestic and noble Fuggle hop to produce a beer of awesome full-bodied flavour with subtle cherry and rich fruit overtones. It tastes superb when accompanied by rich stews, strong cheeses and sweet puddings. TripelLa Fin Du Monde - Unibroue (Quebec, Canada)Image via Unibroue La Fin Du Monde Ale La Fin du Monde (literally French for "The End of the World" as per the translation on the back of each bottle) is a Belgian-style tripel and bottle conditioned golden ale introduced in July 1994. The name is claimed to derive from the European explorers' belief that they had reached the end of the world when they discovered America.The colour is a cloudy blonde with a golden hue. Though similar to Belgian tripels in appearance, La Fin du Monde is less bitter and more spicy (featuring coriander and orange peel), more similar to Tripel Karmeliet than standard tripels like Chimay and Westmalle. The beer contains a very high (9% ABV) alcohol content.*Alternate: Westmalle Trappist Tripel - Brouwerij WestmalleRye Beer Founders Red's Rye IPA - Founders Brewing Company (Michigan, United States)Image via Founders, Red's Rye P.A. The brewery describes this beer as:Serious hop bitterness, along with an unyielding grapefruit bouquet from the Amarillo dry hop, balances the malty richness of four varieties of imported Belgian caramel malts. Pours a spectacular crimson with a creamy tan head. A generous addition of rye malt accentuates a spicy, crisp finish.
