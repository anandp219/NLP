 also goes beyond Snagglepuss with other tracks being covers like "The Sicilian Clan" (Ennio Morricone), "A Shot in the Dark" (Henry Mancini), "Chinatown" (Jerry Goldsmith), and "The James Bond Theme" (John Barry). In A Bookshelf On Top of the Sky, Zorn mentions that "Bernard Herrmann is one of my favorite composers, and there is an element of Bernard Herrmann in almost all of my music. "At the onset of his professional career, Zorn was most well known for his free jazz efforts. In Snagglepuss the role of free jazz is notable and, when combine with the noise music of Yamataka Eye, creates the most memorable passages from the unrelenting, visceral nature of the sound. In a 1998 interview with Wilkowski in Rockers, Jazzbos & Visionaries, Zorn mentions that he started playing the saxophone after discovering Anthony Braxton's album For Alto(1969), a seminal recording with each track dedicated to a groundbreaking icon of the avant garde movement (John Cage, Cecil Taylor, Leroy Jenkins, etc). Of this group of free jazz innovators, Zorns music is most closely associated with Ornette Coleman, whose 1960 album Free Jazz gave rise to the term. In addition to the Ornette Coleman cover of Lonely Woman on Naked City, Zorn recorded the album Spy vs Spy: The Music of Ornette Colemanin 1989 featuring the compositions of Coleman performed in the brief intense style of Zorn's hardcore miniatures (akin to the outbursts in Snagglepuss).In A Bookshelf On Top of the Sky, Zorn expressed that he has for a long time been influenced by Charles Ives and cartoon music, especially the work of Carl Stalling of Wile Coyote and The Roadrunner notability. According to Zorn, both Ives and Stalling display a level playing field for every genre to coexist in, no style or practice is used in a way to imply elitism or division between low art and high art.Lastly, there is the possibility that Zorn was indeed influenced by other composers working with polystylism. In the 1971 essay "Polystylistic Tendencies in Modern Music" author Alfred Schnittke, himself considered to be a leading figure in polystylism, cites the a number of composers utilizing this concept in their work(s). Of these I can hear similarities between Luciano Berio (the third movement of his Sinfonia), Alfred Schnittke (Concerto Grosso no.1), Mauricio Kagel (Ludwig van), Carl Orff (Carmina Burana), Krzysztof Penderecki (St. Luke Passion), Karlheinz Stockhausen (Hymen), and Igor Stravinsky (Pulcinella). Zorn describes in A Bookshelf On Top of the Sky an affinity for block form as used by Stravinsky and later Stockhausen. Zorn calls this "moment form, where each moment is complete in itself, like building blocks. And the moments are positioned one after another in a linear fashion so it ends up telling a story."After the recording of the band's debut Naked City others influences would resurface on the band's next full-length release, Grand Guignol (1992), which also included performances of works by Claude Debussy, Alexander Scriabin, Orlande de Lassus, and Olivier Messiaen. It is unclear of much the musics of these composers influenced the construction of Snagglepuss.
