 of equal beats so that it is quite distinct melodically. Next, Reich splices together the two-voice tape with the four-voice tape, then divides it again into eight voices. At this point the voices are, according to Reich, separated it by just a demisemiquaver, so that the whole thing began to shake, then just faded it out and again put those two takes together. So there's absolutely no manipulation of the timbre, no manipulation of the tape.This point of not tampering with the material itself is at the core of Reich's process pieces. In fact, he views these semantically as early speech works, not works of electronic music because they are based entirely on actually vocal sounds, not on electronically produced tones. Also in Music as a Gradual Process: Part I Reich stated:In a nutshell, all the bad things I've had to say about electronic music have to do with electronically generated sounds, have to do with oscillator-based music  I still use electronic organs, but they're always mixed with instruments or voices. I have no such ambiguity about [using] the voice.It is curious that Reich uses the term ambiguity to describe his hesitation, or more succinctly, the lack of hesitation to work with the human voice. Ambiguity becomes a mode of expressiveness with Come Out, but also among other tape and electronic music works with speech/language elements. With such a strong political implication at first, the repetition of phrase progressively degrades its meaning, becoming ambiguous and obscured. David Schwartz writes of this in the article Semiotics, Psychoanalysis, and the Music of John Adams and Steve Reich, saying that Come Out [uses] repetition obsessively to strip meaning just as it is about to take shape. Is Reich, in essence, making Hamm's recorded speech less poignant, more clinical? It could be understood that Hamm's recorded statement, though highly charged with emotion, can only be taken literally, as it entails a first person account of an event. By excerpting the text down to a fragment, Reich is inviting a multitude of interpretations. Listeners can take in the music of Come Out as just that, Absolute Music consisting of harmonic, melodic, and polyrhythmic combinations of a found sound. By using the impersonal technique of phasing, the moment-to-moment relationships resulting here are mostly unforeseen even by the composer. Rather than craft the text-setting to play up its programmatic aspects, Reich merely sets things into motion, in part relinquishing control over the decaying intelligibility of Hamm's message, and by extension the listener's connection with the politicized message.
