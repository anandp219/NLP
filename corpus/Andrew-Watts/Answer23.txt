.In the score preface Ives stated: Of the three short piano pieces that I've composed with the use of quarter-tones, the first and last were originally intended for a quarter-tone piano, two keyboards and for one player. This proposed setup is clear through the music of each of these movements, however, not realized in typical performances; instead defaulting to the two players, two pianos arrangement (which is reflected in the published score with two grand staves). When this statement from the composer is paired with examination of the notation an argument could be made for Ives' conception of the quarter-tone piano, but settling for the sake of practicality. Excerpt from I. Largo. The phrase, though orchestrated across two pianos, would be playable as a solo if one performer had access to both keyboards. Ives, who was reportedly writing 3 Quarter Tone Pieces from 1923-24, may have been composing with such an instrument in mind. According to Boatwright: [The Czech composer, Alois Haba] wrote for a quarter-tone piano brought out by A. Forster in Prague in 1923; it had two keyboards, one tuned a quarter-tone higher than the other, Ives seems to have been familiar with a similar instrument in New York, as he mentions in his article a quarter-tone piano of this type by Dr. Stoehr, Mehlin & Sons. It is unclear whether Ives had any knowledge of Haba or Wyschnegradsky. The microtonally tuned two manual piano was also used later by Wyschnegradsky, however, his earlier quarter-tone piano works (for example Op.5 Quatre fragments from 1918 and Op.10Variations sur la note from 1918-1920) call for two instruments similar to Ives' pieces for the same reason-- compromise for practicality. Image of Alois Haba with a quarter-tone piano [Page on haba-quartett.de]Though the music clearly necessitates six performers, Haas is also approaching the microtonally tuned piano as one meta-instrument, but takes it further to create one resultant voice. Haas builds a feeling of the single mind generating gestures through the efforts of six individuals. Perhaps a more appropriate imagery for his 72 EDO piano temperament would be a multi-manual piano akin to the Haba and Wyschnegradsky examples, only with six keyboards on the solo instrument rather than two. For as much trouble as Ives had with procuring a quarter-tone piano and the related issues in performance practicalities, Haas' troubles would have been even greater for a hypothetical six manual 1/12th tone piano. Nevertheless, his writing points toward singular goals, often relating to overtone harmonies, achieved through microtonal polyphonic imitation applied to the six pianos. On the aforementioned Universal Edition page Haas describes his approach to the piano writing for the last section of Limited Approximations, stating: [...] A microtonal countermovement is composed into the final third of the piece: from the fifth C-G to the neutral second between the E sharp raised by a twelfth-tone and the F lowered by a sixth-tone. Thus 10 different intervals arise, each of which becomes the centre of an overtone chord. [...] Melodies recur again and again, wandering from piano to piano  as tremolo, as individual tones, as overtone chords. [An] interval (for example the fifth C-G) sounds in all octaves  but some of these octaves are expanded by a twelfth of a tone. The ear corrects the chord (or tries to correct it)  looked at horizontally, the intervals oscillate in twelve-tone steps, but stay in the same place after all The fact that Haas conceived Limited Approximations as a work of three parts may be a coincidence when comparing it to Ives' 3 Quarter Tone Pieces. Despite the composer partitioning of the work into sections, the approach to each is unified in, as Mason expresses, [its] ability to move between systems within 72tet: traditional 12-tone equal temperament, 24-tone equal temperament (quarter tones), and the pitches of the harmonic series up to the 12th partial are all subsets of 72tet. The same integration between sections cannot be said about the three Ives pieces. The first two pieces share more in common with the solo piano literature of the 18th and 19th centuries than the 20th and 21st. Ives (again via the score preface) characterizes I. Largo as [...] primarily diatonic, using quarter-tones as passing tones or suspensions and quarter-tone chords as extensions or variants. For II. Allegro Ives is even more dismissive, stating [it] is mostly made of rhythms contrasted or 'split' between the two pianos. From a pure quarter-tone harmonic standpoint it doesn't amount to much.The parallelisms in the final sections of each work are, however, fortuitous. Like many of Ives' compositions the last movement incorporates a chorale. The composer describes the microtonal functionality here as [a] cantus firmus, taken by the upper voice in the coda [...] made of a phrase in quarter-tones going to one in half-tones and ending in whole tones, while the harmonic plan remains throughout on a quarter-tone basis. Though it is not stated if the cantus firmus is original or not, many of his compositions draw upon quotations, in particular hymns (i.e. Three Places in New England). Haas' piano writing at the end of Limited Approximations also functions akin to a chorale, albeit perceptually stretched and intervalically compressed to an extreme. The strongest relationship between these points is the utilization of quotation and the reference of church polyphony. The most disparate aspects lie in the macro treatment of microtonality: spectral techniques without traditional form (Haas) vs. more intuitive quarter-tone treatment of harmonies with traditional form (Ives).
