 In addition to the great examples already here, I suggest checking out the Rachmaninov 5 tudes-tableaux, orchestrated by Ottorino Respighi. As a senior in high school I was quite familiar with these virtuoso piano pieces by Rachmaninoff. However, I was shocked that someone had the audacity to orchestrate such thoroughly pianistic works. Furthermore, Respighi's orchestrations actually happen to be superb, capturing the expressive gestures of the soloist and translating it into the massive machine that is the symphony orchestra. Often idiomatic writing for one instrument does not translate that well to another. For a side-by-side comparison I recommend listening to 4. Le chaperon rouge et le loup ("Little Red Riding Hood") from Op. 39, No. 6:Original solo piano versionhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Respighi orchestration (excerpt is at 17:48)http://youtu.be/y1th6B6cG-E?t=17...Lastly, according to Classical Archives:In 1929, conductor Serge Koussevitzky (who had already scored with his idea to have Maurice Ravel orchestrate Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition) suggested to his publisher, Editions Russe de Musique, that they should commission the brilliant Italian composer Ottorino Respighiwho was now internationally famous as a result of his tone-pictures The Pines of Rome and The Fountains of Rometo orchestrate a selection of Rachmaninov's tudes-tableaux. Fortunately, Rachmaninov, Respighi, and Editions Russe all agreed, and the orchestration of five of them soon came about.Earlier, Rachmaninov had kept the visual inspiration of the tudes-tableaux secret, saying, "I do not believe in the artist discussing too much of his images. Let them [the audience] paint for themselves what it most suggests." But with the Respighi orchestration project settled, he wrote his Italian colleague, "Will you permit me, Matre, to give you the secret explanations of their composer?" Rachmaninov sought thereby to aid Respighi find the right orchestral colors.
