 of analysis regarding the form and structure in Ockeghems works. Reflecting this, Missa Prolationum is categorized as a prolation canon or mensuration canon, because its main melody is accompanied by one or more imitation of that melody in other voices. Mensuration canons are often thought of to be among the most difficult to write because not only do the voices sing the same melody, but also they do so at different speeds. As a result of this complexity of construction they are fairly uncommon throughout the repertoire. Author Edward A. Melson in his paper Compositional Strategies in Mensuration and Proportion Canons, ca. 1400 to ca. 1600 points out that Ockeghems interest in this specific method was a rarity for the time:The record for this canon is not so extensive as for the motet, probably not least because in contrast to motets, mensuration and proportion canons form a miniscule part of the total repertoire of Renaissance music, and no composer apart from Ockeghem seems to have shown a sustained interest in them. In order to find a historical precursor to Missa Prolationum with a high probability that Ockeghem would have studied as an example of a rigorous mensuration canon, one may have to widen the search beyond the Franco-Flemish School. Johannes Ciconia (c.1370-1412) is a good candidate, as his Le Ray Au Soleyl was quite influential. Also, at a nearly a century earlier still, there was Philippe de Vitry (1291-1361) whose four prolations were used simultaneously by Ockeghem in Missa Prolationum. Perkins describes this act of musical quotation by Ockeghem as: [Perhaps] the most extraordinary contrapuntal achievement of the 15th century [] it presents a series of canons whose interval of imitation expands from the unison progressively through to the octave in accordance with a complex combination of verbal instructions, rests and mensural signs. Surprisingly, the result is a graceful, euphonious composition that gives the listener no hint of the intricate technical problems it embodies. Lastly, a major influence inherent in the complex canons was mathematics, and though this is not technically a musical influence it did shape compositional thought the 15th century. Paul Kinsman in Platonic and Pythagorean Ratios in the Formal Analysis of 15th Century Music highlights this crucial aspect of Ockeghems Missa Prolationum: This mass typifies a musical composition whose structure suggests a link with the type of celestial mathematics that pervades 15th C composition. The Prolation mass consists entirely of mensuration canons, or prolations, which employ a single melody to be imitated by one or more voices after a duration of time. In Ockeghems original mass only two voices are notated and the other two voices must be derived from the notated. When the two notated voices perform with the other two derived voices, a double prolation canon ensues. Ockeghem places the upper pair of original and derived voices in the prolatio major while the lower voices in prolatio minor and one voice in each of the pair sings in perfect time while the other sings in imperfect time. In Missa Prolationum the interval of imitation increases throughout the mass from the unison up to the octave, using all of the traditionally imperfect intervals as well. This intricate mass is one of Ockeghems most intricate pieces and in turn one of the most complex Renaissance compositions. Beside the intricate prolation canon, the actual structure of the mass references divine mathematics.
