 as before or, if low on those ingredients, another quick dish. 08:00PM This is often a critical point. I have been awake for 12 hours and completed enough new material to have run into a conceptual or practical roadblock (musically speaking). I still feel in the zone though, and begin to pace around my apartment while pondering solutions to this issue or issues. 10:00PM I have come up with a plan of attack and am implementing this. Generally, it is unclear at first whether or not a given solution will work. Sadly, this means I have to compose a great deal of music before I can determine if it is a successful fix or if I need another approach. 12:00AM - 02:00AM (depending on the day) I am running solely on craft and inertia, trying to fulfill as much of the latest idea as possible while still making sense. Writing short notes about where this will continue the next day is commonplace, along with skeletal sketches. When I feel enough of the idea has been realized on the page for me to know how to pick it up again in the morning I try to go to sleep. As I close my eyes thoughts and combinations relating to the composition are still racing through my head. I jump up and run back to the desk to jot things down at least twice before actually falling asleep.The weeks of the year when I am actively writing a new composition I rarely leave my room. I do not compose at an instrument, such as a piano, and therefore do not need to be at an office or studio in order to get work done. As long as I have a place to sit and write in my manuscript book (maybe also an outlet for my laptop) I can be equally productive. I never need a board meeting to determine what direction the next project will take. If I get bored I can always change things up; go someplace new, write for instruments I have no experience with, tinker / experiment with other techniques / forms I have only heard in my head, and so on. No one can prevent me from pursuing a given direction in my music or have the authority to tell me otherwise.The deep isolation can be tough, not so much on me (I have always worked well alone), but on others close to me. Often I will catch a cold the week after I finish. My body and mind have been in such a state of prolonged stress that when I am ready to relax and let my guard down my immune system takes a break too. Thinking really hard about something for such a long time does require time afterwards to reset and readjust to "normal" life for me. With that being said, I would not trade it in for anything. Getting to witness wild abstractions come to life time and time again is the greatest feeling in the world. To this day after every performance of mine this notion continues to amaze me. The composition was just a blank sheet of paper not too long ago, and in that regard, all pieces start the same way. What fascinates me is that from this uniformly blank slate comes almost all music I have heard and will ever hear.
