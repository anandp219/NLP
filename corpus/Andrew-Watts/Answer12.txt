 [image via Beethoven's Symphonies: Where To Start]Perhaps this was not the intent of the question, however, I read "just a great composer" to be trivializing in tone. Is there something wrong with just being a great composer? Composing is not an easy profession, and composing in a way that leaves a substantial mark on the history of Western music is immeasurably harder still. I find that all biographies of major historical figures in music to be questionable to some degree. How could I be inspired by Beethoven's life, when I have no idea what he was really like? Which account am I supposed to believe? No matter how faithful the author (or in the case of films, director) attempts to be, there are simply too many fictitious, often Romanticized versions of Beethoven out there. The closest thing to truth is the catalog of works he left behind. Many of his original manuscripts still exist and function as a document of his intent. This is the definitive Beethoven.Therefore, I do not view Beethoven to be anything more or less than a great composer. To be a great composer is in fact high praise, and to be considered one of the greatest composers of all time by musicians and non-musicians alike is perhaps the highest praise anyone devoting their life to composition could hope for.
