 voice and I am going to play it back into the room again and again until the resonant frequencies of the room reinforce themselves so that any semblance of my speech, with perhaps the exception of rhythm, is destroyed. What you will hear, then, are the natural resonant frequencies of the room articulated by speech. I regard this activity not so much as a demonstration of a physical fact, but more as a way to smooth out any irregularities my speech might have.Lucier, Alvin, and Douglas Simon. Chambers. Middletown, Conn: Wesleyan University Press, 1980. Musical score.Also in the preface for I am sitting in a room, Lucier instructs the performer to choose a room the musical qualities of which you would like to evoke. Like the Schwitters piece, Lucier's score is void of any typical musical instruction or standardized notation: no rhythms, no meters, no pitches. Similarly, the performer, though often a musician like with Ursonate, does not need to be. The first distinction between the two works is that one could now argue the text for I am sitting in a room is not even structured musically. Performers can, and have on various occasions, disregard the given text and make their own of any length and content. The piece works regardless of the text, albeit taking on a slightly different individual character for each interpretation. What transformed Ursonate into a musical performance was this human interpretation, however, for I am sitting in a room it is the opposite and the most musical qualities are attributed to the non-human electronic transformations. These transformations of speech into more perceivable music parameters are made possible by the physical properties of each acoustical space. Brandon LaBelle outlines the process in his book Background Noise: Perspectives on Sound Art:By replaying the recording of his voice back into a room, rerecording and playing back, repeating the process, the work develops into an accentuation of acoustic space whereby the sound source (voice) loses its original shape through larger conversational interaction in which the voice makes apparent the surrounding architecture through its disembodied reproduction. Over the course of the work's process, the original recording dissolves into a long, moving tone, punctuated, as Lucier points out, by rhythm alone  for we can still make out the general impression of the original spoken text: its inflected edges, the moments of pause, and Lucier's stutter. What we hear, then, is phenomenal in so far as space is articulated by sound, yet imbued with an uncertain psychological imperative, for as Lucier's voice states, the work is a process through which any speech impediment (in this case, his stuttering) may smooth out. It therefore appears that ambiguity is a key component in whether or not something is musical. Schwitters and Lucier approach ambiguity from opposite directions, despite the surface similarities in their text based compositions. For Schwitters ambiguity in syntactic meaning is essential to the construction of the text, and adheres to the first half of the music definition (organizing sounds in time and space). For Lucier ambiguity is achieved little by little in the composition's trajectory toward the second half of the music definition (gaining more traditional melody, timbre, harmony, and rhythm through the loss of speech). The room functions as a complex filter, which according to Aden Evens in Sound Ideas: Music, Machines, and Experience, accentuates some bands of energy, dampens others, and alternates the phase (time shift) and the pitch (frequency shift) of any sound caught in its space. Lastly, in the album notes to the 1990 recording I Am Sitting in a Room: For Voice on Tape (Lovely Music) Nicholas Collins emphasizes this point of equating increases in syntactic ambiguity with increasing in musicality, stating:By the end we cannot distinguish where one word ends and another begins; the text is completely unintelligible. What was once a familiar word has become a whistled three-note motif; what was once a simple declarative sentence has become a curiously tonal melodic fragment; what was once a paragraph of unaffected prose has become music. Somehow, somewhere in the course of 40 minutes of mean of what we've been listening to has slipped from the domain of language to that of harmony.
