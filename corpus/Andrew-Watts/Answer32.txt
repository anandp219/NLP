 At institutions with the most funding the average matriculation age is usually around 29 years old. The ages when entering such a program frequently span from 25 to 35, with those outside of this range in either direction extremely rare. I know this might come as a shock to many in the STEM fields where typical incoming Ph.D. students are fresh out of undergrad. However, for small programs like Stanford and Harvard the intake is only 2-3 new doctoral composers per year. With such a limited number of spots, competitive applications must demonstrate substantial training in the field and high promise of attainment as composers. "Substantial training" often means already having earned a master's degree in composition, participated in international music festivals, garnered professional commissions, and premiers with top ensembles/soloists. All of these components take time and are difficult to attain at any age, especially for young composers still searching for their voice. Those beginning a doctoral program at a larger school of music or at an institution with stand-alone master's programs are often younger. 24-25 years old is quite normal here because these schools commonly accept students from their own master's program into their doctoral program upon graduation.[Image via Elliott Carter at 99]
