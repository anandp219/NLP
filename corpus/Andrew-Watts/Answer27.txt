 where the audience is perceiving the points of saturation as explorations into new timbres, yet not fully abandoning the rock band archetype. Though the contribution of the rest of the band musically was quite sparse during this Star Spangled Banner performance at Woodstock, without their presence to fulfill the model expected of the situation the audience would have likely felt abandoned by such unorthodox, ungrounded sounds from the soloist. Secondly, the relationship the soloist has with the composition is also unique among the three works here. At its origin, the Star Spangled Banner is not a contemporary piece, in fact it is far from it. The Star Spangled Banner is an example of a contrafactum: new lyrics set to existing music. In this case, the music was initially "The Anacreontic Song", also known as "To Anacreon In Heaven", and functioned as the official song of the Anacreontic Society, an 18th-century gentlemen's club of amateur musicians in London. It is fascinating how this Colonial-Era, British drinking song has transformed over the centuries-- with Francis Scott Key penning new lyrics during the Defense of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812, to its later revisions and subsequent publication as a patriotic song, to the song's official designation as the U.S. national anthem in 1931, to represent the unbridled freedom sought by the late 1960s counter-culture via this iconic Hendrix rendition. It is clear that the most notable, and subsequently imitated, aspects of Hendrix's version of the Star Spangled Banner were not in any way indicated through the notated composition. The aggressive whammy-bar dives, frequent forays into amplifier feedback, and quick chromatic alterations between thick extended chords (foreign to the original song) contribute to the characteristic timbral saturation of this Woodstock performance. Interestingly, this was not the first time Hendrix had performed the Star Spangled Banner--by a long shot. According to Hendrix scholar Joel J. Brattin in an article with Worcester Polytechnic Institute there are nearly 50 live recordings of Hendrix playing the national anthem, 28 made before Woodstock.

For Hendrix, the techniques leading to timbral saturation were honed in over many performances, as the work was initially without any native tendencies in this regard. The sections of timbral saturation function not as a harmonious embellishments on the preexisting material, but rather the soloist's artistic commentary on the piece itself, virtually re-imagining the work in his own musical language. Trash TV Trance was composed in a world where both Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner and Lachenmann's Pression had already existed for over 30 years. As a result, Romitelli creates in many ways an amalgamation between these, taking the distorted electric guitar and approaching the instrument in an even more obscure, unorthodox, Lachenmann-like way. The timbral saturation is not achieved with the same sense of spontaneity or fluidity seen in the Hendrix, as Hendrix's performance was likely drawing from equal parts prior performances and novel improvisation. Trash TV Trance is fully notated, and though some interpretation is necessary for all written music, soloists for Romitelli's piece stick closely to the nuanced indications in order to accurately reproduce the intended effects. Some of these effects (touching the live 1/4 jack from the instrument cable to the metal guitar bridge, scraping the plectrum against the low E and A strings in a circular motion, etc) generate timbral saturation, though they are employed as discrete sounds, each with a repeatable identity. Where this diverges with Lachenmann is Romitelli's use of combine techniques. The resultant is far more saturated timbrally, however perhaps less opaque and ambiguous than Lachenmann's more detailed gestures. [Image via Page on youtube.com]
