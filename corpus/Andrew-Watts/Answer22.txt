 be transformed. The synthesized sine waves can glissando independently, each by different amounts, toward the partials of the bell.[3]For the boy's voice the real and fake are clearly discernible in their isolated forms through the presence (or lack thereof) of text. The synthesized voice is able to maintain the feel of a human singing through degree of exactitude in sine wave reproduction in overtones. However, it falters in lacking the nuances necessary to physically produce sound in the throat and mouth (inhaling, exhaling, syllabic articulation, etc). For the tenor bell the differentiation is far less straightforward. The envelope of attack of the real bell is often reshaped by Harvey during playback to provide a greater sense of ambiguity. Without this distinctive attack it is unclear from the onset whether what is being played is the bell, a sine tone, or even the entrance of the boy's voice. The fake bell in its isolated form still sounds fake, though this judgment is at the threshold of differentiability. As there are less physical characteristics to cue the listener (no breath or text), and the same generation of overtones from the original sound source is exercised, the final verdict for discerning the bell is a I know it when I hear it situation.[4]Perhaps the most immediately palpable and yet mysterious use of illusion stems from the transfiguration of the voice and the loss, or at times fragmentation, of the prescribed text. The clear presentation of the Latin inscription through the opening lyrics sets up a certain expectation given the tradition of boy choristers singing in Anglican liturgical settings. Short texts, such as this one in Mortuos, are typically repeated ad nauseam during a mass or similar setting to showcase the abilities of the choir and composer to generate elaborate contrapuntal tapestries given the modest initial material. Harvey deviates from this practice by the degree of compressing, excerpting, and otherwise mutilating the original recording of the sung passage. Composers of early church music certainly employed similar techniques of augmentation, diminution, inversion, and retrograde to make the most out of their materials, but this was always within the realm of human performance. By removing the restriction of human performance Harvey is able do away with the standard division keeping single sounds from becoming both individual small-scale events and multiple large-scale formal markers. For instance, the recording of the boy's voice is utilized in one section as a flurry of incomprehensible burst, sped up and played in reverse as to mimic the sounds of a tiny engine. The text content is lost entirely here. To achieve forward motion Harvey will then employ the polar opposite treatment to the same recorded passage, stretching the voice to such an extreme that the specific articulations which would ordinarily be heard as consonants are now odd, languid impurities in an otherwise pure wave of slow-moving sonorities. Again, the text content is lost entirely, albeit for a completely different reason. Lastly, when the same manipulations are performed on the synthesized version of the voice, already devoid of text content, a full catalog is established where the composer can freely draw upon any of these versions to add to and comment on the original Latin meaning.
