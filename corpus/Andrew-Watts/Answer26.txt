 indeterminate.[Image via John Zorn Cobra, North Sea Jazz, Rotterdam / NL, 2009]Cobra (1984)  John ZornThe concept behind Cobra is to take the Ornette Coleman style of free improvisation and apply it to a larger ensemble through a game. There is no published score for Cobra. Rather, according to Dylan van der Schyff in the article The Free Improvisation Game: Performing John Zorn's Cobra, the piece is conveyed through a stack of cardboard cue cards with handles taped to the back of them. On the front of the cards are large letters (SX, CT, D, T, E, B, and so on), numbers (1,2,3, I, II, III) and other symbols. Schyff further details the game, stating:We were each given a sheet where the function of each cue card was described. The sheet contained more symbols in the form of hand gestures. We were also given headbands. As Zorn explained how the system of symbols and gestures worked I realized why the piece could not be published in the traditional way. For one thing, there is no proper scorethe piece consists of a set of events cued by symbols on the cards as well as by the catalog of hand gestures on the cue sheet; the content of each event is entirely dictated by the musicians performing it. Furthermore, there is no conductorthe initiation of events is brought about by the ensemble members themselves via the prompter who stands facing the ensemble (back to the audience) with the cue cards on a table in front of him; the ensemble is arranged in a semicircle facing the audience, the prompter and each other. In performance the prompter is bombarded by various cues from the ensemble, with each musician trying to get the prompter to display the symbol he or she wants to initiate the next event. And while it is impossible for the prompter to be completely impartial, it is largely for the musicians to decide which type of cue will provide the most interesting continuation of events.For example, one musician might hold one hand over his mouth while displaying four fingers with the other hand, meaning that he wants the sub crossfade event to take place. If the prompter notices him first the SX card will be displayed to the ensemble and those who are playing fade out while those who are not playing fade in. Another musician, hearing something she likes, might place one hand on her head and hold up one finger with the other hand cueing the prompter to display the 1 card. This card initiates the sound memory 1 event where musicians are to remember what they are playing at that moment and be able to immediately reproduce and repeat it for an extended period the next time the 1 card is displayed. A myriad of other possible events may be cued, such as duo and trio combinations or different types of endings; donning the headband signals that the musician has decided to temporarily do as they pleasea renegade action that may elicit reactionary responses from the ensemble.Like Voyager, where Cobra lies on the indeterminacy/improvisation continuum is hazy. Each of the cue cards is composed, despite the nontraditional text and symbolic notation. The conductor, or rather, 'prompter' is also the composer, therefore the order that the events take is not necessarily random, otherwise it would not be much of a game. Furthermore, the game is rehearsed. The rehearsal process likely solidifies certain musical responses to specific cue cards from each player. During the concert, what an individual performer is player may not be improvised, if he or she had galvanized that response throughout rehearsals. It is, however, nevertheless indeterminate because the order of events is not revealed and the resultant sounds from various orchestrations are constantly changing. Lastly, it could very well contain a great deal of improvisation, as the above article suggests. The 'prompter', though not making any sound, could effectively be improvising. The players have not rehearsed the transitions and exact timings, plus without written parts there is bound to be differences in performance even among those with solidified musical responses to each symbol. Aspects such as the exact number of musicians, instrumentation, and duration of the piece as a whole are left as indeterminate.[Image via 80 Jahre Terry Riley]In C (1964)  Terry Riley The balance between indeterminacy and improvisation with In C is similar to Cobra, only achieved through more traditional means. Unlike Cobra, there is a score, albeit laid out in an open, modular way. There is no conductor per se, however, the the straight 8th note high C's of the pulse for a piano or mallet instrument functions in a similar way to a conductor. Furthermore, the current (2005) edition of the score Riley publishes contains the following instructions:All performers play from the same page of 53 melodic patterns played in sequence. A group of about 35 creates a rich full overlay but interesting performances have been created with many more or many less.Patterns are to be played consecutively, with each performer having the freedom to determine how many times he or she will repeat each pattern before moving to the next. There is no fixed rule as to the number of repetitions a pattern may have, however, since performances normally average between 45 minutes and an hour and a half, it can be assumed that one would repeat each pattern somewhere between 45 seconds and a minute and 1/2 or longer.It is very important that performers listen very carefully to one another and this means to occasionally drop out and listen. As an ensemble, it is desirable to vary dynamics as well as create group crescendos and diminuendos.Each pattern can be played in unison or canonically in any alignment with itself or its neighboring patterns. One of the joys of playing IN C is the interaction of the players in polyrhythmic combinations that spontaneously arise among patterns. Some quite fantastic shapes will arise and disintegrate as the ensemble progresses through the piece.It is important not to hurry from pattern to pattern but to stay on a pattern long enough to interlock with other patterns. As the performance progresses, performers should stay within 2 or 3 patterns of each other. It is important not to race too far ahead or lag too far behind the main patterns sounding.[] The tempo is left to the discretion of the performers. Extremely fast is discouraged. When a performer is not playing, she should be conscious of the larger periodic composite accents that are sounding. When she reenters she must be aware of what affect [sic] the entrance will have on the overall flow.The ensemble should aim to merge into a unison at least once, but preferable [sic] often during the course of a performance. If all patterns seemed to be played too much in unison a player should try to offset his pattern by and [sic] 1/8th note or other value so as to create a feeling of shifting alignments. It is OK to transpose patterns. Take care when transposing, especially with patterns in running 16th notes. This can create a very muddy sound. Also all instruments should aim at a blend at [sic] no one instrument should stick out except momentarily. Rhythmic augmentation of patterns can be effective.Players may omit patterns that are too difficult or unsuitable for their instrument.Amplification of instruments is allowed to help achieve a balanced dynamics Electronic instruments are also welcome.This is more indeterminate than improvisation. The parameters of extemporaneousness include dynamics, octave, individual tempo, and repetition to say within 2-3 modules of the group. However, a number of these parameters are limited naturally due to each instrument's capabilities. The indeterminate parameters are plentiful. The composer relinquishes the above listing (dynamics, tempo, instrumentation, duration, repetition); yet retains pitch, order of events, and rhythms. What separates In C from the other works is the sense of group improvisation towards a common goal. Cobra is made up of a group of improvisers, but each player has his or her own vested interests. In C is more about working together to create a tapestry rather than competing against each other in a game.
