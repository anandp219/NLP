 This is certainly dependent on how "intense" is defined when applied to listening. When I think of intense listening experiences they usually contain a lot of: timbral saturation, abrupt interjections, harmonic complexity, and a shockingly visceral affectation. Oftentimes, this is only an excerpt from a work, though may be the most memorable part. Similarly, for me, it is hard for any other era to compete with the 20th-21st centuries when it comes to raw "intense" sonorities. Of course there are emotional, heart-wrenching moments in works throughout hundreds of years constituting the Classical canon. In fact, I have focused on a number of them in a previous answer (What are the most badass classical music compositions?). Nevertheless, for this listing I will stick to a few "modern" interpretations of intensity--Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1960) by Krzysztof Pendereckihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
