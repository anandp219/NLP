 Curtis Lindsay hit the nail on the head, piano transcriptions of orchestral music used to be the norm. Composers would often write a piano short score or piano four-hands before orchestrating the work. For example, you will find a number of piano versions for Rachmaninoff's symphonic pieces. My favorite happens to be the composer's final work, Op. 45 Symphonic Dances.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Similarly, solo piano, piano four-hands, and various orchestrations exist for Brahms' most famous works (notably the Hungarian Dances). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=... Another major composer/virtuoso pianist known for these such efforts was Franz Liszt, who famously created solo piano arrangements of all the Beethoven Symphonies. My top pick from this series is his take on Symphony No. 6 ("Pastorale").https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=... Lastly, there are some interesting piano versions of orchestral works arranged by pianists. Two notable examples include--Horowitz/Bizet - Carmen Fantasyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Blackford/Wagner - Ride of the Valkyrieshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
