 It could be there is some nuance or peculiarity present in most, if not all of the Mozart works you have heard that is lacking in other classical music compositions you have been exposed to thus far. Similarly, I know folks who state that Johnny Cash is the only country music they like. In their case, they probably do not like that genre's defining musical features, but for whatever reason are willing to ignore that for the sake of the artist's individual voice. In this example, they probably really prefer Cash's genre-spanning songs and sound embracing rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel...in spite of the fact he is primarily remembered as a country music icon. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple induction in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.Mozart also has a great deal of crossover appeal, and wrote in every major genre existing during his lifetime, including symphony, opera, the solo concerto, chamber music including string quartet and string quintet, and the piano sonata. In the end, it is important to remember that no creative figure exists as an island. The influence of Mozart is massive and you will be able to find any isolated characteristic inherent to his music in the works of his successors (and sometimes his predecessors). Though I stick by my ideology from What should I do about Classical Music compositions which I find boring?, I also strongly recommend that you listen to more composers to find additional elements that you can grab on to in other musics.
