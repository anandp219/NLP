 on the Decca/Argo label since the 1950s.Returning to procedure, though one can point to the specific software Harvey used to carry out the spectral analyses; this practice of composing based on source material overtones also implies the influence of Gerard Grisey and Tristan Murail. Both Grisey and Murail were in residence at IRCAM throughout the 1970s and developed spectral techniques with the Ensemble lItineraire. As the term spectralism was only coined by Hughes Dufourt one year prior to Mortuos plango and first published in an article one year after the completion of Mortuos plango, it is perhaps best to think of Harveys efforts as proto-spectral or belonging to the late 1970s  early 1980s spectral zeitgeist at IRCAM. In a similar vein, Harveys composition shows a certain dialogue with the acousmatic listening and musique concrete works of Pierre Schaeffer. With Schaeffer the goal was often abstraction of sounds recorded from the natural worlds, divorcing the received meaning from its original source. Harvey clearly presents both his sound sources in their raw, highly recognizable form, but over the course of the piece gradually abstracts them by moving along a real vs. synthesized continuum.Lastly, there is the lineage of tape music leading up to Mortuos plango. After earning a PhD at Cambridge Harvey studied with Milton Babbitt at Princeton University on a Harkness Fellowship. While there, in addition to the works of Babbitt, Otto Luening, and Vladimir Ussachevsky using the Columbia-Princeton Studios, he would have been aware of the electro-acoustic compositions of Karlheinz Stockhausen. According to biographer Arnold Whittall:During the mid1960s [Harvey] became increasingly aware of new attitudes to time and space in the music of Stockhausen (on whom he published a monograph in 1975), and a period of study at Princeton with Babbitt strengthened his concern with posttonal compositional systems as well as with the possibilities of electroacoustic techniques. [] But for Harvey, like Stockhausen, the best way to explore the special character of the single note was by means of electroacoustics, and as an early recruit to IRCAM he found Boulezs Paris Institute a stimulating environment for the development of his technical and aesthetic predispositions.One could imagine that Stockhausens Gesang der Jnglinge ("Song of the Youths"), often called the first masterpiece of electronic music, was of particular influence while writing Mortuos plango. Realized in 195556 at the Westdeutscher Rundfunk studio in Cologne, Gesang der Jnglinge notably features vocals supplied by 12-year-old Josef Protschka. The inclusion and innocence implied by the purity of a young boys voice creates a precedent with Gesang der Jnglinge that Mortuos plango follows, immediately drawing a comparison between the works.
