 the hour-long time scale into sections. Unlike the Bach, these canons are not built off of a theme inherent aspect of the original (for instance the bass line). Rather, variation takes place via the addition of new motifs while retaining others in a static role. This creates a thread connecting the different canons and provides a sense of subtle growth from point A to B over a long stretch, then (still unhurried) back to A. Though the similarities between each of the Goldberg Variations are palpable, notably the inescapable G Major and ground bass blueprint, the drama is attained by abrupt stylistic shifts. Far from subtle, this path would be more appropriated simplified as point A to B to C to D  to A' (the Quodlibet), then all the sudden back to A for the aria da capo.In lieu of genre pieces breaking up the succession of canons, Abrahamsen uses intermezzi. These periods function as drawn out reliefs from the otherwise relentless ostinati, but also serve the practical function of allowing the players to re-tune their instruments microtonally without completely stopping the motion of the piece. It is incorrect, however, to think that without genre pieces Schnee is not as historically referential as the Goldberg Variations.[Image via Discovering recent masterworks: Abrahamsen's "Schnee"]The color and orchestration achieved by various instrumental techniques is inextricably linked to other works of the modern era; the jet whistle points back to Assobio a Jato (1950) by Heitor Villa-Lobos, the inside-the-piano muting points backs to The Banshee (1925) by Henry Cowell, and the use of office supplies (rubbing sheets of paper) as percussion points back to various efforts by John Cage and then Mauricio Kagel throughout the latter half of the 20th century. The Goldberg Variations references are integral to how Bach navigates variation form. Whereas, these references of modern techniques in Schnee are unrelated to the way variation form is employed, and can be heard as the language of the work instead of a structurally significant component. [Image via Discovering recent masterworks: Abrahamsen's "Schnee"]Lastly, due to the difference in instrumentation between these two works the way that drama is built through variation form is different. The solo keyboard (or harpsichord) player can only maintain so many independent lines at one time, a characteristic tested to the limits in some of the canons. With nine instruments Schnee progresses less by intervallic identity (as in Goldberg Variations) and more by total saturation or density of texture. Canon 1a is sparse and transparent in individual lines, and while some of the momentum is carried over to subsequent canons, more active layers are added, effectively expanding on the core pulse. The result is oddly a more linear development in the variations of Schnee than the complex relationships constituting a development throughout the Goldberg Variations.
