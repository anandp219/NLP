 Yes, a number of times. For instance, the following excerpt from Aphorism 149--Human, All-Too-Human (1878)--represents one of his more controversial:In Bach there is still too much crude Christianity, crude Germanism, crude scholasticism; he stands on the threshold of modern European music, but looks back from there to the Middle Ages.In his essay, Fugue No. 7, author Timothy A. Smith goes on to point out that:Nine years earlier (in the same year he met Wagner) Nietzsche had also praised the St. Matthew Passion. He wrote to a friend that he hadattended three performances in one week, "each time with the samefeeling of immeasurable admiration." [...] Inevitably, Nietzsche's philosophical orientation compelled him to reject Bach's music. With their continual representations of form, rationalstructures, and "unsentimental sentiments" (to use Weaver's phrase),each fugue of the Well-Tempered Clavier would have been a powerfulexpression of the Apollonian "pathology" that had made German culture"sick."
