 my imagination, in a somewhat abstract way. When Jan Krenz recorded it and I could listen to an actual performance, I was struck with the emotional charge of the work. I thought it would be a waste to condemn it to such anonymity, to those digits. I searched for associations and, in the end; I decided to dedicate it to the Hiroshima victims. (p.393) Though this rationale for this change sounds honest enough, according to Bannachs research the title change was made for far more selfish reasons:[Penderecki] only ended changing the name after a recommendation from a friend, who advised him that it would make a more emotional impact for his entering in the UNESCO Prize of the International Composers Jury. That change had an obvious and intended impact. The use of Hiroshima evokes so many emotions, but mostly of sheer horror, a kind of terror hitherto unknown by mankind, that of a nuclear annihilation.  Regardless of which of the reasons is true, the influence and council of the friend, Polish conductor Jan Krenz, is present in both accounts. In the year before writing Threnody, Penderecki won a series of composition prizes. Biographer Adrian Thomas attributes the success of these earlier works with the composers rapid advancement, distilling Stravinskian and Webernian choralism [] to Boulezian gestures. Thomas continues by saying that "though Penderecki never fully engaged with orthodox serial techniques," he did "absorb certain permutational procedures and explore textural writing" which leads to the full blown sonorisms of subsequent scores. Emanations (1958), with its two string orchestras tuned a semitone apart, paved the way for Threnody, which uses quartertone clusters. Within the canonic sections of Threnody Wallin notes the symmetrical organization of materials to be Webernian in principle as well.The influence of Stravinskian and Webernian choralism is further contextualized in Bannachs analysis, whereby he describes the division of the string orchestra up into different choirs in Threnody: Each choirs differential in range is about a third to a tritone from top voice of the choir to the bottom voice. Now, keep in mind, that while each choir is a collection of microtonal pitches, these choirs all overlap with each other to form a composite microtonal collection that spans from an Ab in the contrabasses to a high B natural in the first choir of violins. So all in all that is 52 instruments playing individual microtonal notes spanning a range of around 4 octaves. This, without a doubt, creates an incredible amount of force and tension when played. This tension caused by microtonal clusters is found the piece, and is enhanced with Pendereckis implementation of various timbral and Klangfarbenmelodie type effects.  The concept of klangfarbenmelodie or tone color melody is often credited to the Second Viennese School, in particular Arnold Schoenberg. Bannach asserts that timbre then truly became an independent component in the 1950s when Serialism became a prominent movement in classical music, from the likes of Stockhausen, Babbit, Boulez, and others. This focus on various timbres and the way they evolve in an acoustical space over time is the primary concern throughout Threnody. In the book To Cut the Gordian Knot: The Timbre System of Krzysztof Penderecki, author Danuta Mirka theorizes that Pendereckis interest in such topics may have been through the acoustician Mieczyslaw Drobner:It is likely that such a splendidly simplified image of the sound producing process was taken up by Penderecki from the teaching of Mieczyslaw Drobner, the eminent Polish acoustician and organologist. In 1958 Drobner moved from Lodi to Krakow to take the post of lecturer at Paristwowa Wyzsza Szkola Muzyczna, the school where Penderecki had recently finished his study in composition and was employed as an assistant. (p.436) Lastly, there is the possible influence of Edgard Varse. Wallin notes that: "Varses conception of music as spatialopened the door to music that centered not on melody, harmony, or counterpoint but on sound itselfComposers now wrote pieces whose material consists primarily of striking sound combinations that create interesting and novel textures, organized by gradual or sudden processes of change. Threnody is the embodiment of music which consists of striking sound combinations to create interesting and novel textures.
