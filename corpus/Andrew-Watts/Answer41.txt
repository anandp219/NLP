 I mostly agree with Curtis Lindsay's list, and I would like to further emphasize that Milhaud wrote a lot of music. Today however, his music is not performed very much when compared to other figures of his era (at least in the United States). During my undergraduate I took a number of classes with John Heiss, who studied with Milhaud over the summers at Aspen as a young composer. Intrigued by Heiss' anecdotes, I checked out a bunch of recordings of Milhaud's works. To be honest, much of the music I found to be quite bland. Nevertheless, here are some works I found to be his best.La cration du monde (1923), a ballet which outlines the Creation of the World based on African folk mythology, is probably is most famous composition.Sonata for violin & piano No. 2, Op. 40 (1917)String Quartet No. 1, Op. 5 (1912)String Quartets No. 14 and No. 15, Op. 291 (19481949); The 14th and 15th string quartets can be performed separately as well as simultaneously as a string octet.String Quartet No. 3 with solo voice, Op. 32 (1916); poem by Lo Latil
