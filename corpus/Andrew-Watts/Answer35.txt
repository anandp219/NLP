 placed him among those British composers (especially Bliss, Lambert, and Berners) who were captivated by elements of popular music and neo-classicism spearheaded by Stravinsky and Les Six. [...]A blend of neo-classicism and neo-romanticism continued in the Sinfonia concertante (19267, rev. 1943)[...] (Griffiths)Aaron Copland (1900-1990)  He then studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris (19214) and, as one of her first American pupils, gained a facility for neo-classicism which he skilfully and brashly combined with jazz in his Piano Concerto (1926). (Griffiths)George Antheil (1900-1959)  [...]He consciously chose to change his compositional style in the Symphonie en fa (19256) and the Piano Concerto (1926), compositions which in 1936 he labelled neo-classic. [...]The Piano Concerto, given its premire on 12 March 1927, was criticized as being a mere imitation of Stravinskys neo-classicism and an abandonment of the earlier iconoclastic mechanistic style. (Whitesitt)Kurt Weill (1900-1950)  His early works, for example the String Quartet (1923), reveal a teasing eclecticism that combines the neo-classicism of Busoni with the near-atonality of Schoenberg[...] (Ashley)Roger Sessions (1896-1985)  His early works, though influenced by Stravinskian neo-classicism, are sober and without irony[...] (Griffiths)Dimitri Mitropoulos (1896-1960)  After his contact with the music of Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, and Bla Bartk in Berlin, Mitropoulos became the first Greek composer who  in his mature works of the years 19248  made use of modern techniques and styles, such as atonality (Passacaglia, Intermezzo e Fuga,14 Invenzioni), the 12-tone method (his Ostinata is one of the earliest 12-tone compositions in European music history), new folklorism (Four Cytherean Dances) and neoclassicism (Concerto grosso). (Fulias)Paul Hindemith (1895-1963)  In the same year he wrote the piano suite 1922, fashionably including shimmy and ragtime movements, and Kammermusik no. 1 for small orchestra, which marked a turning towards neo-classicism. (Griffiths)Sergey Prokofiev (1891-1953)  Prokofiev showed quite another side of himself in the Classical Symphony op.25 (191617). His much-quoted remark  I thought that if Haydn were alive today he would compose just as he did before, but at the same time would include something new in his manner of composition. I wanted to compose such a symphony: a symphony in the classical style  reads like an early confession of neo-classicism. Stravinskys Pulcinella, the key neo-classical work, was not begun until two years later. Prokofiev was certainly referring back to classical models here, for instance in the proportions of the symphony, the well balanced sonata movements in the opening allegro and the finale, the triad-based melodies and the occasional Alberti bass figures. However, the stylization also includes Baroque elements, particularly in the third movement, a gavotte, and in the regular accompanying chords of its predecessor. (Redepenning)Arthur Bliss (1891-1975)  After the war he fell under the spell of Stravinsky and Diaghilev, and his first experimental compositionsMadame Noy (1918), the Rhapsody (1919), and Rout (1920)show an attraction towards neo-classicism. (Griffiths)Heitor VillaLobos (1887-1959)  [Lobos] spent 19234 in Europe and 192730 in Paris where he was influenced by Satie and Milhaud and by fashionable neoclassicism. [The] result was [a] series of works called Bachianas Brasileiras in which Baroque forms were recreated with Brazilian local colour. (VillaLobos, Heitor)Ernest Bloch (1880-1959)  He continued to compose steadily, influenced by neo-classicism in such works as the Concerto Grosso no. 1 (19245) but retaining the melodic warmth that had characterized his earlier Jewish music. (Griffiths)Manuel de Falla (1876-1946)  Other works drawing on Spain's musical-historical past include the chamber cantata Psych, set in the court of the 18th-century King Philip V and his consort Isabel Farnese; an introspective yet intense miniature, the work most clearly shows the influence of Debussy. In the spirit of Spanish neo-classicism. [...]If the stylistic label neo-classicist implies an uncomfortably wide range of meanings, it is nonetheless the most accurate description of Falla's works of the 1920s. (Hess)Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958)  The Concerto for violin and strings (19245), originally called Concerto accademico, is Vaughan Williamss nearest approach to a Bachian neo-classicism and was probably written in response to Holsts Fugal Concerto. (Ottaway)Erik Satie(1866-1925)  He continued writing piano pieces up to the same year, anticipating Stravinskian neo-classicism in the Sonatine bureaucratique (an adaptation of Clementi's Sonatina, op.36 no.1)[...] (Orledge)Carl Nielsen (1865-1931)  One of the most important and free-spirited of the generation of composers who straddle the 19th and 20th centuries, his music covers a wide range of styles, from Brahmsian Romanticism at the outset to a high-principled, personal brand of neo-classicism in his last years. (Fanning)Claude Debussy (1862-1918)  All three sonatas [Cello Sonata (1915), the Sonata for flute, viola, and harp (1915), and the Violin Sonata(1916-1917)] anticipated neo-classicism in their simplicity, clarity, and stylistic restraint.
