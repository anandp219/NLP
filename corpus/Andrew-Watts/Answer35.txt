 [Image via Composers :: Philharmonia Orchestra]The term "follow" caries an implication that the composers are currently still active. For example, you might follow a composer's works by attending the premiers or searching for the latest recordings. Neo-classicism within Western music history is often contextualized as a trend arising in the 1920s where composers displayed a renewed interest in the formal clarity characteristic of the 17th-18th centuries. This was often a reaction against the "excessive" orchestration of the late 19thcentury Romantics. Though I am sure there are still many significant composers today who are concerned with utilizing clarity of form, their aesthetic choices are far less referential to classical genres. As a contrast, the most notable neo-classical composers made direct reference to 17th-18th century forms and figures. For instance, Sergei Prokofiev's Symphony No. 1 in D major (Op. 25) "Classical Symphony" of 1917 is written in loose imitation of the style of Haydn (and to a lesser extent, Mozart). Igor Stravinsky's ballet Pulcinella of 1920, typically regarded as the textbook example of neo-classicism, is a commentary on the commedia dell'arte libretto and music composed by Giovanni Pergolesi. Though the popularity of neo-classicism peaked in the 1920s, its precursors and influence extends several decades in either direction. I am still unaware of any contemporary composers today who would self-identify as strict neo-classicists, however, a handful have certainly dabbled in this tradition for past works. To collect recommendations of specific individuals who have written neo-classical pieces I conducted a cursory search through the Oxford Music Online database. Below are figures and key works to look into, ordered chronologically from most recent.Michael Torke (1961)  He continued his exploration of 19th-century genres with the piano concerto Bronze (1990), of which he gave the premire[...] (Chute)Paul Moravec (1957- )  A prolific composer, he combines a respect for and mastery of traditional formal and harmonic structures with a driving individuality; his style can best be described as a fluent, idiomatic, but unusually intense neo-classicism. (Page)John Harbison (1938- )  The works from his earliest period show the dual influences of serialism and Stravinskian neo-classicism. (St George)Henryk Grecki (1933-2010)  He revealed the extremes of his musical temperament in the savaged neo-classicism of the Sonata for Two Violins (1957), which contains potent dynamic and rhythmic contrasts as well as displaying a taste for the grotesque that would resurface over 30 years later. (Thomas)Martin Boykan (1931- )  Boykan's mature style is atonal and reflects the influences of Webern and the late music of Stravinsky, the respective subjects of his two most important articles (Neoclassicism and the late Stravinsky, PNM, i/2, 1963, p.155, and The Webern Concerto Revisited, Proceedings of the American Society of University Composers, iii, 1970, p.74). (Gilbert)Jacob Druckman (1928-1996)  Druckmans earliest published works, such as Divertimento (1950), tend towards neo-classicism. (Clarkson)Ben Johnston (1926- )  Johnstons reputation has rested primarily on his work in microtonality. However, his earlier music was in equal temperament, with a tendency towards neo-classicism (Septet, the early piano pieces)[...] (Kassel)Lukas Foss(1922-2009)  With the more conservative musical taste of the 1980s and 90s, Foss revisited the neo-classicism and Americana of his first period, composing again in traditional instrumental and choral genres, but not forgetting the experimental techniques of his second period. In his American Cantata (1976) he strove to be as crazy as I was in my avant-garde music and yet tonal. His guitar concerto, American Landscapes, combines folk guitar styles and tunes with novel plucking and percussion techniques in the solo part. Similarly, in the wistful and antiquarian Renaissance Concerto, the solo flutes key clicks add percussive effect. (Chase)Leonard Bernstein (1918-1990)  [Choreographer] Robbins included social dances, which Bernstein reflected in the score [West Side Story and Fancy Free] with big band rhythms, some block scoring, and blues inflections, tied together with a Copland-like musical stance and neo-classicism heard in many concert works in the 1940s. (Laird)Arthur Berger (1912-2003)  [...]The diatonic skeleton of his music provided a connection with Stravinskian neo-classicism; indeed, Babbitt used the term diatonic Webern in a review of the Duo for cello and piano (1951) and Berger himself hinted at a merging of the two styles in his work when he described the Chamber Music for 13 players (1956) as neoclassic twelve-tone. (Kaufman)Samuel Barber (1910-1981)  The vein of American neo-classicism that entered his music in the 1940s, in such works as the Piano Sonata (1949), refined his style without changing it fundamentally. (Griffiths)Lennox Berkeley (1903-1989)  The score [Jonah] is permeated with Stravinskian neo-classicism  in some ways it seems to anticipate The Rakes Progress  and its construction in separate numbers derives from the Bach passions and cantatas. (Dickinson)William Walton (1902-1983)  []Faade (19212) [...]won the composer a reputation for wit and iconoclasm and placed him among those British composers (especially Bliss, Lambert, and Berners) who were captivated by elements of popular music and neo-classicism spearheaded by Stravinsky and Les Six. [...]A blend of neo-classicism and neo-romanticism continued in the Sinfonia concertante (19267, rev. 1943)[...] (Griffiths)Aaron Copland (1900-1990)  He then studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris (19214) and, as one of her first American pupils, gained a facility for neo-classicism which he skilfully and brashly combined with jazz in his Piano Concerto (1926). (Griffiths)George Antheil (1900-1959)  [...]He consciously chose to change his compositional style in the Symphonie en fa (19256) and the Piano Concerto (1926), compositions which in 1936 he labelled neo-classic. [...]The Piano Concerto, given its premire on 12 March 1927, was criticized as being a mere imitation of Stravinskys neo-classicism and an abandonment of the earlier iconoclastic mechanistic style. (Whitesitt)Kurt Weill (1900-1950)  His early works, for example the String Quartet (1923), reveal a teasing eclecticism that combines the neo-classicism of Busoni with the near-atonality of Schoenberg[...] (Ashley)Roger Sessions (1896-1985)  His early works, though influenced by Stravinskian neo-classicism, are sober and without irony[...] (Griffiths)Dimitri Mitropoulos (1896-1960)  After his contact with the music of Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, and Bla Bartk in Berlin, Mitropoulos became the first Greek composer who  in his mature works of the years 19248  made use of modern techniques and styles, such as atonality (Passacaglia, Intermezzo e Fuga,14 Invenzioni), the 12-tone method (his Ostinata is one of the earliest 12-tone compositions in European music history), new folklorism (Four Cytherean Dances) and neoclassicism (Concerto grosso). (Fulias)Paul Hindemith (1895-1963)  In the same year he wrote the piano suite 1922, fashionably including shimmy and ragtime movements, and Kammermusik no. 1 for small orchestra, which marked a turning towards neo-classicism. (Griffiths)Sergey Prokofiev (1891-1953)  Prokofiev showed quite another side of himself in the Classical Symphony op.25 (191617). His much-quoted remark  I thought that if Haydn were alive today he would compose just as he did before, but at the same time would include something new in his manner of composition. I wanted to compose such a symphony: a symphony in the classical style  reads like an early confession of neo-classicism. Stravinskys Pulcinella, the key neo-classical work, was not begun until two years later. Prokofiev was certainly referring back to classical models here, for instance in the proportions of the symphony, the well balanced sonata movements in the opening allegro and the finale, the triad-based melodies and the occasional Alberti bass figures. However, the stylization also includes Baroque elements, particularly in the third movement, a gavotte, and in the regular accompanying chords of its predecessor. (Redepenning)Arthur Bliss (1891-1975)  After the war he fell under the spell of Stravinsky and Diaghilev, and his first experimental compositionsMadame Noy (1918), the Rhapsody (1919), and Rout (1920)show an attraction towards neo-classicism. (Griffiths)Heitor VillaLobos (1887-1959)  [Lobos] spent 19234 in Europe and 192730 in Paris where he was influenced by Satie and Milhaud and by fashionable neoclassicism. [The] result was [a] series of works called Bachianas Brasileiras in which Baroque forms were recreated with Brazilian local colour. (VillaLobos, Heitor)Ernest Bloch (1880-1959)  He continued to compose steadily, influenced by neo-classicism in such works as the Concerto Grosso no. 1 (19245) but retaining the melodic warmth that had characterized his earlier Jewish music. (Griffiths)Manuel de Falla (1876-1946)  Other works drawing on Spain's musical-historical past include the chamber cantata Psych, set in the court of the 18th-century King Philip V and his consort Isabel Farnese; an introspective yet intense miniature, the work most clearly shows the influence of Debussy. In the spirit of Spanish neo-classicism. [...]If the stylistic label neo-classicist implies an uncomfortably wide range of meanings, it is nonetheless the most accurate description of Falla's works of the 1920s. (Hess)Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958)  The Concerto for violin and strings (19245), originally called Concerto accademico, is Vaughan Williamss nearest approach to a Bachian neo-classicism and was probably written in response to Holsts Fugal Concerto. (Ottaway)Erik Satie(1866-1925)  He continued writing piano pieces up to the same year, anticipating Stravinskian neo-classicism in the Sonatine bureaucratique (an adaptation of Clementi's Sonatina, op.36 no.1)[...] (Orledge)Carl Nielsen (1865-1931)  One of the most important and free-spirited of the generation of composers who straddle the 19th and 20th centuries, his music covers a wide range of styles, from Brahmsian Romanticism at the outset to a high-principled, personal brand of neo-classicism in his last years. (Fanning)Claude Debussy (1862-1918)  All three sonatas [Cello Sonata (1915), the Sonata for flute, viola, and harp (1915), and the Violin Sonata(1916-1917)] anticipated neo-classicism in their simplicity, clarity, and stylistic restraint.
