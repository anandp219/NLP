 immediate historic comparison would be to the sound-clouds of Iannis Xenakis (ex. Pithoprakta, 1956), micropolyphony of Gyorgy Ligeti (ex. Apparitions, 1958-1959), and the tone clusters of Krzysztof Penderecki (ex. Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima, 1960). Though all of these works are precursors, it is unclear how much their concepts influenced Nono's writing in Canti di vita e d'amore. One primary distinction is the use of independent lines. Though achieved through different means (aleatory vs. notated polyphony), this feature unifies Xenakis, Ligeti, and Penderecki. Nono uses the same large scale divisi and pitch distribution, but often without the independent, individualized movements within each divisi texture. It is possible that the similarities between all of these works stem from a late 1950s  early 1960s, increase in textual complexity zeitgeist, rather than peer influence. Nevertheless, some of the relationships are uncanny. Nono has written about his lifelong study of Italian Renaissance choral composers Gabrieli and Gesualdo with regard to their use of spatialization, as well as figures from the Franco-Flemish School. Ligeti attributes much of the influence for his micropolyphony technique, especially as used in Lux Aeterna and Requiem, to Johannes Ockeghem, arguably the most famous composer of the Franco-Flemish School. Another specific connection between Canti di vita e d'amore and Ligeti's music is the method of pitch choice between each individual instrument. In Irvine's analysis he highlights that in the first movement: Six notes are distributed between the violins in a form of cross fertilization; each entry determined by successive notes from the first violin part. This creates a web of sound producing a strikingly referential effect, in that all the parts are here alluding to one another. A technique similar to that used by Gyorgy Ligeti in his Chamber Concerto (1969-70). Next, there is the issue of shared programmatic theme. Penderecki's Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima was completed just two years before Nono's Canti di vita e d'amore, whose first movement utilizes text from the book To Be or Not To Be: Diary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by Gunther Anders. In Nono's defense, though composed later, Canti di vita e d'amore shows evidence of the chosen text being integral to the understanding of the work. On the other hand, Penderecki had already completed and premiered Threnody, originally called 8'37" (at times also 8'26") as perhaps a nod to John Cage's 4'33", before deciding to dedicate the work to the victims of Hiroshima. It is likely that because Nono and Penderecki's compositions are so close in date, Nono had already selected his text and begun the piece before Penderecki changed his work's title.Regarding text, though not technically a musical influence, the choice of text has shaped the composition and subsequent understanding of Canti di vita e d'amore. For instance, the use of excerpts from Anders' To Be or Not To Be: Diary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was so critical to the identity of the work that not only did Nono use it for the composition's subtitle (Sul ponte di Hiroshima // On the Bridge of Hiroshima), but actually wrote into the score the lines beyond what he set for the voices as a 'guide' to the conductor and players. The second movement, Djamila Boupacha, moves from suffering on a massive scale represented by the full ensemble to suffering on an individual scale. Here Nono sets a poem by Jesus Lopez Pacheco in which the tortured Algerian student of the title begs: "to see things like a child" and to be free from "this night of blood, this endless mud." Nono scores this for solo soprano (unaccompanied), allowing the audience to impose the girl from the text onto the vocalist. The last movement Tu is set to the words of Cesare Pavese and anticipates a new dawn for society. According to Borio, Nono redefined Utopia through his own concepts of other ways of listening and possible infinities. This desire to create a new, more just society is at the core Canti di vita e d'amore and was likely influenced by Nono's political background. Borio notes that the Nazi occupation and the Italian Resistance were fundamental to Nono's general development. In 1952 the composer became a member of the Italian Communist Party, and as Durazzi mentions, Canti represents Nono's move away from a kind of leftist idealism and toward more concrete forms of social and political activism. Lastly, there is the influence of Nono's close friends Bruno Maderna and Emilio Vedova. Borio writes that meeting Maderna in 1946 was musically critical for Nono, as they formed a small community in Venice who, through the examination of the contrapuntal, harmonic and formal foundations of European art music, aimed to develop a new musical language. Maderna's criticisms of integral serialism may have led to Nono's new approach to pitch (campi sonori) in Canti di vita e d'amore. Maderna saw composers relying on serial techniques to establish a divide between their music and pre-WWII classical traditions. He went on to say in an interview with Leonardo Pinzuati:There never has been any zero year in music, just as there can never be any zero year of culture. It would be as though someone reaching the age of thirty were to say 'my life is now beginning'! That sounds all very well, but the preceding years still happened, he still lived them, with all the experiences and errors.Immediately before working on Canti di vita e d'amore, Nono was in residence at the Studio di Fonologia Musicale RAI in Milan composing an electronic piece entitled Omaggio a Emilio Vedova. Vedova, an artist by trade, shared similar political leanings with Nono and they both collaborated on many occasions. According to Irvine, Omaggio a Emilio Vedova contains striking similarities in gesture to the first movement of Canti di vita e d'amore; indeed the first 20 seconds of the Omaggio seem like a study for the opening 20 seconds of the Canti. It is then not out of the question that, because the opening musical material of both works dealt with the same concepts, Nono (perhaps even unconsciously) was influenced by his memories and experiences with Vedova while writing Canti.
