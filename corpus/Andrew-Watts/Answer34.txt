 clearly defined tutti sections which embrace writing of stark contrasts, from sprung rhythms reminiscent of early Tippett to Ligetian micropolyphony. (Hinton) Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975)  The Symphonic Dedication to October  later designated the Second Symphony  is a single-movement oratorio-symphony. The work is notorious for its miasmic opening, with layered polyrhythms prophetic of 1960s Ligetian micropolyphony, and for a passage of manic 13-part free-association counterpoint as anarchic as anything in Schnittke. (Fanning)Clytus Gottwald (1925- )  Ligeti's pools of sound, for example, influenced Gottwald's transcription of Soupir by Maurice Ravel, and Ligeti's micropolyphony is the primary feature of the transcription of Berg's Die Nachtigall. (Bloesch) Friedrich Cerha (1926- )  [Baal is] a slick 1920s foxtrot rubs shoulder with micropolyphony and aleatoric procedures, and there is even an allusion to Messiaen's ornithological music. (Clayton) Alfred Schnittke (1934-1998)  The brief, wordless Voices of Nature (1972), for ten women's voices and vibraphone (deployed in an eleven-part canon), is closer to the Schnittke we know in its use of Ligetian micropolyphony to produce dense and dissonant clusters. (Anderson) Sndor Balassa (1935- )  Finally, the contrast between rangy expressionist vocal melody and a dense micopolyphony in which isolable melody plays little part obviously suggests Ligeti, though Ligeti himself had not clearly adopted this technique when Balassa composed his Requiem in 1968-69. (Walsh)Erkki Salmenhaara (1941-2002)  On meeting Ligeti in 1962 [Salmenhaara] began to study his music and launched the concept of Tonfeld in Finland, which in Ligetis music covers both static timbres and micropolyphony, i.e. textures in which details are subordinated to the whole as statistical elements (permeability). (Heinio)Vahram Ohani Babaian (1948- )  [Babaian] makes use of impressionist and sonoristic techniques (the ballet Pygmalion), heterophony and micropolyphony (Fifth Symphony) and dense textures involving chords and clusters. (Sarkisyan)Akira Nishimura (1953- )  Nishimura principally employs heterophony, a characteristic device of Asian traditional music, thereby subtly transforming the intervals, rhythm and melody of his dense multi-layered textures. Though similar to the micropolyphony of Ligeti, an Asian perspective informs his technique. (Narazaki)Erkki-Sven Tr (1959- )  When the solo lines [of regilaul] play against the larger instrumental body, it is often in the complex textures of Ligetian micropolyphony. (Anderson)
