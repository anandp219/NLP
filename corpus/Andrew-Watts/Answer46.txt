 I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but there are simply not that many schools in the United States that guarantee full funding to all admitted composition students for stand-alone master's programs. Furthermore, those that do cover all expenses are certainly not overlooked by prospective applicants. For example, Yale School of Music and the Curtis Institute of Music generally post acceptance rates well below 10 percent. Wesleyan University also has a fully funded MA in composition. Their music department continues a phenomenal legacy of experimental music which has included esteemed faculty like Anthony Braxton and Alvin Lucier. Lastly, I have known a few composers who are extremely adept with technology that have completed fully funded multi-disciplinary master's degrees. The two to check out for this sort of path are Dartmouth College's Digital Musics Program and the MIT Media Lab.If you are determined to study music composition at the graduate level then please do not let these limited options dissuade you. There are a number of other factors to consider and possible outcomes. Other institutions do give select scholarships, they are just not guaranteed for all admitted students. Feel free to message me if you have more specific questions. I would be happy to chat about the process.
