 Of the works featuring percussion written in the past few years I really like:Pierluigi Billone -  Wall (2012)On the composer's site, Billone writes of the piece:In ancient Greek culture,  (Dike -justice-) was the spirit of moral order and fair judgment.From the Orphic Hymn 61:The piercing eye of Justice [] bright, I sing, plac'd by the throne of heav'n's almighty king [Zeus],Perceiving thence, with vision unconfin'd, the life and conduct of the human kindTo thee, revenge and punishment belong, chastising ev'ry deed, unjust and wrong;Whose pow'r alone, dissimilars can join, and from th' equality of truth combine:For all the ill, persuasion can inspire, when urging bad designs, with counsel dire, 'Tis thine alone to punish; with the race of lawless passions, and incentives base;For thou art ever to the good inclin'd, and hostile to the men of evil mind.Come, all-propitious, and thy suppliant hear, when Fate's predestin'd, final hour draws near.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
