 microtonal intervals. Haas further describes the influence of Scelsi in Three Questions for Sixty-Five Composers: [In] listening to a concert at the Graz Musikprotokoll festival that was devoted exclusively to his compositions and lasted several hours, I realized that he shaped sonority as such, purely as a sounding process, evolving instant by instant. Those apparently freely flowing spaces where the difference in the richness of beat in more or less neighboring tones creates a depth and an intensity which for me, up to that moment, had been unheard of, gripped me  I sensed the necessity to take up in my work where Scelsi had left off. The last major influence would be through figures composing with overtone chords in mind, both considered spectral (Tristan Murail) and not (Harry Partch, James Tenney, La Monte Young). Though often cited as a leading spectralist figure, Haas has stated in an interview (5 Questions for Georg Friedrich Haas) with Sam Reising on the website I CARE IF YOU LISTEN:I do not feel myself as a spectral composer. I use some chords, which have relationships to the harmonic series. I use them because I love them and because they sound great. But I never used spectral analyses [...] I trust my sensations. I try to find out how sound and colour and time and dynamics fit together. I do not have any system. I do not trust systems at all.Nevertheless, the ideas put forth by spectral composers have been important in Haas' own compositional practice. He has further explained the creative relationship he has with spectral concepts in the Three Questions for Sixty-Five Composers:Creative processes are sometimes set in train by verbal statements by composers which may have rather an intriguing relationship with the compositions to which they refer. I remember a fascinating lecture by Tristan Murail in Darmstadt: the orchestral work which was subsequently performed was markedly different from what I had expected on the strength of the lecture. I realized much later that the pieces which correspond to what I had expected from Murail would need to be composed by myself. Regarding Partch, Tenney, and Young, their use of the harmonies that deviate from the conventional tempered scale influenced Haas immensely. He was particularly interested in the twelfth-tones and even smaller intervals up to the quarter-tone when conceiving the six piano turnings in Limited Approximation. In an article with IRCAM Haas claims that the overtone chords, as crafted by Partch et al., contain these microtones do not sound wrong here but, rather, soft and melting, since they can be derived directly from the acoustic principles of instrumental sound.
