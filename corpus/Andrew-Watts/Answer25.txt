 in my craft my interest in more technical publications began to take over my reading list, both out of necessity and a pure love for the material. These included The Collected Essays of Milton Babbitt, Olivier Messiaen's The Technique of my Musical Language, and Erno Lendvai's Bela Bartok: An Analysis of His Music.During my final year in undergrad I received a commission to write an art song for a music festival. I took this as an opportunity to delve deeper into modern poetry. I felt strongly about using text from a contemporary writer, as I would hope those in other art forms would feel strongly about using music from a contemporary composer. Thus, I poured over hundreds of short works in various collections and anthologies. I eventually settled on Mark Strand's piece Eating Poetry. Much like the realization that I favor absurdity in humor as a high school senior, through this quest for a text I realized as a college senior that I favor surrealism in poetry.While at Oxford for my master's I focused deeper into modernism. The most helpful and engaging publications I encountered were Marguerite Boland and John Link's Elliott Carter Studies, and Iannis Xenakis' Formalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in Composition, and David Metzer's Musical Modernism at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century. In particular, Metzer's book was pivotal in my understanding and contextualization of artistic expression in today's world. Today I am starting to be in the odd, yet fortuitous position where I know either the subject or the author (or both) that I happen to be reading. I had the great privilege of studying with Aaron Einbond, and recently he, along with Aaron Cassidy, published Noise in and as Music. I view this book as the next step after Metzer's work on modernism. Einbond notes that-- Its contributors are first and foremost practitioners, which inevitably turns attention toward how and why noise is made and its potential role in listening and perceiving.Lastly, about a year ago I was completing an artist residency at the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts (VCCA). As with most artist residencies, the fellows are given a room and private studio to work on their respective project. During mealtimes everyone comes together at the dining room and socializes. At VCCA there is also a tradition of weekly readings, performances, and gallery showings by the current fellows after dinner on a given evening. This is a great, low-key opportunity for everyone to share a bit about their discipline among such a multidisciplinary group. The evening presentations throughout my time there were always a highlight; not only because of the high level each artist was working at, but also because it allowed me to see a different side of an individual that had perhaps remained hidden through the friendly discourse and daily small talk. One of the fellows whose residency overlapped with mine was Sharon Charde, and over the few weeks we were both at VCCA we chatted quite a bit. Our conversations were different from those I would have at other institutes and festivals with composers. After a day or so with a composer I would have a clear idea about how their music would sound and how they relate to their art form before even seeing a score or hearing a recording/performance. With Sharon we spoke about PBS programs, about interpersonal relationships, about graduate school (I was probably a bundle of nerves waiting to hear back after my Stanford interview), and so on. Toward the end of my stay, Sharon mentioned that she was going to present excerpts from one of her books after dinner. I was excited to hear her readings, but honestly was not predicting what it would be like based on getting to know her.That evening I was floored. Sharon's selections from Branch in His Hand were so intense, so wrought with beauty and sadness that I did not know how to respond to what I was hearing. Underneath the family therapist, the mother, the wife, the friend, was someone with a profound ability to express loss.
