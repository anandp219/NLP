 In my mind, this sort of inside the piano technique really began with Henry Cowell (1897-1965). His works Aeolian Harp for string piano (ca. 1923) and The Banshee for string piano (1925) were both highly influential. If you have not already checked Cowell's solo piano works out, then I recommend starting here.http://youtu.be/zIZ5vt6a6Uc Next, I would be remiss if I did not then mention John Cage (1912-1992) and his pioneering work Sonatas and Interludes (1946-1948). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=... Along similar line of working with prepared piano would be Hauschka (1966- ). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=... Within jazz there have been a number of pianist who utilize percussive effects on the instrument. For example, Gwilym Simcock (1981- ) does some inside the piano rhythms in These are the Good Days.http://youtu.be/vQO7cP34NQY?t=4mHerbie Hancock and Chick Corea are also well known for incorporating percussive piano effects into their improvisations. http://youtu.be/h7Dn4Ipu8n8?t=39sThese extended piano techniques are very common among contemporary composers, and I will try to add to this list when I think of additional works.
