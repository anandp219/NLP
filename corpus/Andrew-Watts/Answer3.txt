 when the timbani play in short 6, 7, and 9 bar bursts of clusters.[...]The non-motific and textual technique he employs here in the instrumental writing utilizes all twenty- four pitches and there is a consistent approach of the surrounding suspended notes with microtonal clusters. At this stage of his creative life a total, stratified chromaticism was common in Nono's work and out interest in pitch lies in the registral placement of these notes in their specific wave-form and in their relationships with other musical parameters. This approach to the orchestra with the campi sonori may be seen as dialoguing with the historical "sound-cloud"/"micropolyphonic"/"tone cluster" works immediately before it. While it does share the same densely saturated walls of sound covering the quarter-tone steps within larger intervals, there are clear distinctions. Iannis Xenakis' Metastaseis (1954), Gyorgy Ligeti's Apparitions (1958-1959), and Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1960) use the clusters as the entire texture. Nono's writing in Canti di vita e d'amore is often arguably more subtle, and perhaps even more complex. The clusters are compartmentalized in these 'waves', usually isolated to given instrumental choirs. Thus, while these clusters are entering and exiting the textures, other elements are sometimes also active and following different compositional techniques. Though Xenakis, Ligeti, and Penderecki show more total line independence in their respective works due to the greater number of players partaking in any given cluster, all of their massive divisi function as a unified composite, with all of the forces contributing to create the same sound. In Canti di vita e d'amore despite not having the same total number of divisi, there is a sense of multiple textures happening at once. II. Djamila Boupacha is orchestrationally very straight forward as it only involves solo soprano. Durazzi suspects that this movement was written earlier than the surrounding movements, and that is why the approach is completely different. Perhaps this was a "free-standing solo vocal work or as part of a project that was to be separate from the 'Hiroshima cantata'."III. Tu returns to the full forces of the first movement. Durazzi explains the evolution of campi sonori in this last movement:The campi sonori are developed using essentially the same techniques as in the first movement, but the roles of the orchestral instruments are substantially different. Except for a few notes in measures 182-84, the strings never play in the traditional modes of arco or pizzicato, but instead produce percussive effects (strings tapped by the fingers or col legno battuto in various positions along the fingerboard). Another distinction between the first and third movements is the treatment of divisi. In Sul ponte di Hiroshima the string section transitions between various degrees of saturation with divisi, and cannot be reduced to a simple linear gesture (such as one large unison to divisi trajectory). Whereas, Tu does maintain a linear trajectory in the string divisi, moving from unison at the beginning to fully divisi at the finale. Nono also ups the ante within the full divisi texture, which now consists of triple-stops in all the strings. Lastly, there is the role of the percussion clusters. Durazzi makes a case for their inclusion by relating their role to the "fratello" motive from Luigi Dallapiccola's opera Il prigioniero (194448). Here the tuned metal sheets are tied to the notion of hope that conditions might improve. This motif is borrowed by Nono in a number of works as late as Con Luigi Dallapiccola (1979) for six percussionists and live electronics. Durazzi follows this motivic relationship chronologically back through to the beginning of the final movement of Canti di vita e d'amore, stating: [After] the strong promise of a brighter future, the first sound in the orchestra is a twelve-note cluster played by bells. The predominance of bells and cymbals emphasizes the new-found sense of hope in the final movement and thus emphasizes the global progression of themes in the work. The way the orchestration is treated in the various movements may be understood (when taken with the lyrical content) to complete a narrative moving from mass destruction in the past to the tortured individual in the present and lastly the hope for the future.
