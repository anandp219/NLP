 W.A. MozartBy Hermann Abert; translated by Stewart Spencer; edited by Cliff EisenDuring my sophomore year in college I took an honors class entitled "Mozart and His Era." The required reading before each lecture was always from Abert's W.A. Mozart, a massive tome clocking in at 1,544 pages. Stephen Pritchard of the Guardian calls this a "a million-word monument" and after finishing it over the span of the semester I attest that it is thorough in a way unlike any other biography I have encountered. German musicologist Hermann Abert first published this obsessive book (a magnum opus in its own right) as three volumes in 1923-24. 80 years later translator Stewart Spencer and editor Professor Cliff Eisen have completed the staggering task of creating an English version as one single edition; adding 200,000 words of footnotes and annotations, as well as taking into account the decades of Mozart scholarship since Abert's work first appeared.The publisher, Yale University Press, describes the biography as:Hermann Abert's classic biography, first published in German more than eighty years ago and itself based on the definitive mid-nineteenth century study by Otto Jahn, remains the most informed and substantial biography of Mozart in any language. The book is both the fullest account of the composers life and a deeply skilled analysis of his music.Proceeding chronologically from 1756 to 1791, the book interrogates every aspect of Mozarts life, influences, and experience; his personality; his religious and secular dimensions; and the social context of the time. In a book within a book, Abert also provides close scrutiny of the music, including the operas, orchestral work, symphonies and piano concertos, church music and cantatas, and compositions for solo instruments.
