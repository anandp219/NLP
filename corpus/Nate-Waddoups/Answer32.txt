 I think it is more commonly spelled "canoodling" and I found a web page with some theories about how it entered the English language:Webster's claims that canoodle comes from the German knudeln:Ger knudeln, to cuddle < or akin to LowG knuddel, a knot, clump, dim. of dial. knude; akin to OHG knodo, OE cnotta, knotWiktionary claims origin unknown, but it offers two possible origins:Origin Unknown; compare Swedish knulla (to fornicate), German knuddeln (to cuddle)There's more, on Origin of "canoodle" at English Language & Usage Stack Exchange, so click through if you like. The theory of German origin seems the most promising to me, but I don't speak enough German to understand any pages about the etymology of knudeln / knuddeln. But perhaps Judith Meyer can offer some insight?
