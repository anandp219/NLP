 No. We know quite a bit about how X and Y chromosomes produce male and female genitalia, but we don't know nearly enough about what causes a person's brain to identify as male or female. It is entirely possible that people with gender dysphoria have brains that have perfectly sound biological reasons for identifying as a gender other than what their chromosomes would typically lead to.Not to mention people whose bodies have clearly developed in a way that doesn't exactly match one end of the male-female spectrum or the other, or people whose chromosome's aren't simply XX or XY.Just because most people's minds do match their genitalia, doesn't mean that everyone's should match. Nor does it mean that for every case in which they don't match, there is a problem with the person's brain. For all we know, they may be in perfect mental health - they just were born with a body that doesn't match their brain. Imagine that you woke up tomorrow with a different set of genitals that you have today. You're still you, and your identity is the same as it ever was - only your anatomy is changed. Disorienting, right? Now imaging that for every day of your life, you have been waking up with that other anatomy. You're still you. You are still the same person that you have always been. You still identify as the person that have always been. But your body doesn't match your identity, and it never has. Would you consider yourself mentally ill if that were the case?
