 The notion that good guys with guns can stop bad guys with guns is not based on the idea that armed bystanders should act as vigilantes. It is based on the idea that victims should have options other than begging for mercy.Firearms are for self-defense, not vigilante heroics.As the fellow in the article said, you don't want to be mistaken for the perpetrator when the police arrive. This is of course a risk even when defending yourself and a loved one, and many of the drills taught in firearm self-defense classes include elements that are intended to minimize that confusion (for example, shouting "drop the weapon" repeatedly).In addition, if you don't know the participants intimately, you yourself may not be able to tell aggressors from defenders, so you could end up making a bad situation much worse.In addition, it is obviously far safer to flee danger than to get involved. In addition, even in the best-case scenario, in which you miraculously shoot the aggressor and don't get shot by the aggressor or another good-guy-with-a-gun, you're likely to lose everything you own defending against criminal charges brought by people who weren't there to see what you saw, in addition to a civil suit by the aggressor or their surviving kin. So unless you or a loved one is in immediate danger of a much worse outcome, it's best to just get yourself and your loved ones as far away as fast as possible.I have taken three classes on gun safety and self-defense, from two schools, and in every class the position on this issue has been the exactly same - do not get involved in violence unless you or your loved ones are being threatened.
