 First, know that all generalizations are false. But some generalizations are useful. For example:If the comments are explaining what the code does, that's generally a sign that the code should have been written more clearly. Use more descriptive variable names, extract chunks of code into methods that can be given descriptive names, factor out classes to keep them simple (single responsibility principle). And so on. If the comments are explaining why the code does what it does, that's generally a good thing. Is there code somewhere else that depends on something non-obvious here? Do customers prefer this approach to an obvious alternative? Is there a different approach that was considered but rejected? Bonus points if there's a bug number where I can read more.
