 It might be possible, but it is extremely unlikely. Note that rsum readers and interviewers at top companies typically have a very large number of rsums to filter through, and not enough time. So the process involves a lot of false negatives - candidates rejected for relatively minor reasons. A lack of CS education might be offset by good experience (many people in the industry now got there after a career change), and lack of experience is very often offset by education (such as most college hires). But having neither makes it easy to pass over your rsum.You would need to have something on your rsum that offsets your lack of education and experience. The only thing I can think of that might do that would be a very impressive piece of software written by yourself.Something like, "working alone, I wrote a piece of software which allows users to ___________." What you put into that blank needs to make the screeners think "wow, if this is true then this candidate could be great despite that lack of education and short experience."I don't have any bright ideas about what to put into that blank. Normally, contributing to an open-source project can't hurt, but in this case your background would probably lead rsum readers to assume that your contributions were commensurate with your lack of experience. So I think you really need a solo project.If you spend the next 6 months writing exceptional software, the kind that gets users and/or gets recognized on tech industry web sites, that might get you an interview.
