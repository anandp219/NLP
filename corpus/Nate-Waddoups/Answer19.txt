 Consider this article from the New Yorker in 2012:The Simple Truth About Gun Control - The New YorkerParticularly this part:At some point, we will become a gun-safe, and then a gun-sane, and finally a gun-free society. Its closer than you think. That is the sort of phrase that causes gun owners to believe - not entirely incorrectly - that the true purpose of gun control legislation is to confiscate everyone's firearms. So gun owners dig in their heels. So nothing changes.Background checks are a nice idea in theory, but writers like this guy make it clear that limiting criminals' access to firearms is just a step on the path to getting firearms out of everyone's hands. After checks are required, the requirements will be modified to prevent anyone from actually passing the check. (There is precedent - one of my colleagues came from a county in California that required specific training in order to obtain a concealed handgun license. The county didn't offer that training, so they didn't grant those licenses.)So it's not just "the NRA" that opposes background checks and registration requirements - it's a whole bunch of law-abiding, firearm-owning voters, who have been given solid reasons (for example, this article) to fear that background checks are a veiled attempt to ban ownership, and registration is a step toward confiscation. The NRA is just the mouthpiece.The "gun free society" advocates are just as much to blame for this deadlock as the NRA is. Perhaps moreso - the NRA's "extreme" positions are a rational response to an organized attempt to outlaw firearm ownership.I do think background checks are a good idea when a firearm changes ownership. But I understand why so many firearm owners are reluctant to support legislation proposed by people whose stated goal is, in this author's words "a gun-free society."
