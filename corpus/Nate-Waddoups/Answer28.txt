 Cancer. One could argue that cancer is just a side-effect of a system that works pretty well overall. Evolution created countless species, inhabiting every possible ecological niche. It has been marvelously effective in finding ways to exploit an amazing variety of habitats and energy sources. But evolution also created the potential for cancer, and if you're an individual with cancer, it sucks. It'll probably kill you - slowly, painfully, miserably. It is interesting to look at cancer as a product of evolution on two levels. At the macro level, millions of years of evolution have brought us countless species, by producing (and selecting for) genes that mutate ever-so-slightly. Most mutations are harmful, but a few end up being beneficial, allowing their carries to reproduce more effectively than the competition. Some of those harmful mutations resulting in unviable offspring (perhaps another candidate for "worst product of evolution"), others produce tumors that lead to death at an arbitrary age.At the micro level, most individuals are born cancer-free, but mutations that accumulate over time eventually give rise to a cancer cell. The cancer cell then reproduces more effectively than its non-cancerous competition - winning the evolution game among its peers, but ultimately killing the creature that carries it, thus bringing about its own demise.Cancer just sucks any way you look at it. So it gets my vote for "worst product of evolution."
