 No, your employer does not get access to any other content on the device.Setting up an Exchange account can trigger increased security measures, such as more digits in your unlocking PIN, automatic locking after a short idle time, or enabling the Exchange admin to wipe the Exchange content (or even, in some cases, the whole devic). But those are the only kinds of side-effects. And you can always opt out if you aren't happy about it. If you are concerned about the content on the device, you should probably be using those extra security measures anyway. I think of it as a helpful reminder.The remote-device-wipe feature is the only thing that is potentially dangerous. Apps are only really required to wipe the content that came from the Exchange server, but many apps will do a factory reset instead. But the other content on your device will NOT be accessible to your Exchange administrators.
