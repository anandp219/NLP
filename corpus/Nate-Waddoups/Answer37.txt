 "What is a good snowboard" depends more on your personal preferences than anything else. For some narrow, well-defined disciplines like racing, there are key parameters that you probably won't want to deviate from very much, but freeride is a pretty broad term.If you are in an area where it is feasible to rent a few different kinds of boards, that's a great way to try boards with different charcteristics. Take notes on length, width, sidecut radius (a massively under-appreciated parameter) and how you felt on that board in different conditions. Groomed, moguled, powder, steep, fast, etc, etc.Eventually you'll find what your own preferences are - longer or shorter, stiffer or softer, wider or narrower, larger or smaller sidecut radius, etc.Or you can just pick a high-end model from a high-end brand. The industry is mature enough that you're very unlikely to get a substandard board that way. But without trying a few options you also won't know what you're missing.Also, if you find that what you want isn't actually available in any manufacturer's catalog, you can go to companies that will build boards to your specifications, like Prior or Donek. Personally, I like a short stiff board with a large sidecut radius, which is an odd combination, so I have a couple of custom boards from Donek, and I've been really happy with them.
