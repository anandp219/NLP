 Eating from your hand is convenient, but not required. If the parrot will eat treats that you place in a bowl or on a table, that will work just fine. Both of my parrots will eat from my hand, but sometimes it is easier to just put a safflower seed on the table for them. I do that sometimes when they're fetching things, since I might have one hand out to receive the object while my other hand is holding a clicker. They only care about getting the seed, they're just as happy getting it either way.If you can get them accustomed to taking treats from a bowl, you can use that to teach them other things - in fact you could probably use that to teach them to take treats from your hand.
