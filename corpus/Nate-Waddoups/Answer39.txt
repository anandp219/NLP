 Switch to "approval" voting. Basically allow voters to check the box next to each candidate that they approve of. Instead of trying to decide between the canidate that you like the most, versus the candidate that you kinda like but think might actually win, you'd vote for both. Or three or four.Lots of people don't vote for their favorite candidate because it's too important to vote AGAINST the other party's leading candidate. It's hard to get excited about that.See also: Nate Waddoups' answer to Why doesn't the USA have a viable national independent party?
