 There is no reason to think that grays are unique. Note that Dr Pepperberg didn't choose a gray for her research - she got Alex as a pet first, then figured that it would be interesting to see how much Alex could learn.A mutual acquaintance told me that Dr Pepperberg said she suspects that macaws might be able to learn more, or learn faster (I forgot which), but she also said that there's no way to know for sure without another research effort similar to the one that Alex was in. The training that Alex received was unique in scope and quantity, and as a result of that uniqueness we can only guess at how well it would work with other species. Or even with other individuals - for all we know, Alex was unique and no other bird will replicate his feats. Everybody expects training with other individuals to work just as well, but until the results have been replicated, we can't truly know.
