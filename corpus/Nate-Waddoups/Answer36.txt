 Since there are no details - what is going on, what signs is he ignoring - it is impossible to answer this question with any confidence. However, as someone who is terrible at picking up hints and clues in relationships, I have to say that it is entirely possible the hints and/or clues are too subtle for him. To find out, tell him what's going on, and see how he reacts.Maybe he'll say he was surprised to learn that, and then he'll respond appropriately. Then you can more forward together.Maybe he'll express surprise, then respond inappropriately. Now you have a new problem, but at least you'll both understand where the disagreement is. Maybe he'll disagree with you about whats' going on. That could be a bad sign, but it could also mean that you are actually the one who is mistaken about what's going on. It happens to all of us from time to time. But again, at least you'll understand where the two of you disagree.Since you're concerned that he's lying, it seems likely to me that you have other reasons for not trusting him. In that case, it might be best to just end the relationship. If he is not trustworthy, this is obviously the best thing to do. But even if he is trustworthy, ending the relationship might still be the right choice, since both you you will be better off in a relationship where there is trust. So, think hard about whether you really should trust him or not. If you don't, or for some reason you can't, the relationship is not going to be a good one.
