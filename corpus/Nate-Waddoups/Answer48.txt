 Take a deep breath, and repeat after me:"I'm going to do this. If anyone has a problem with this, that is their problem, not mine."Stand tall, smile, and get it done. Own it. It's your face, you can do whatever you want with it. If anyone looks at you funny, just smile, look them right in the eyes, and nod. Don't be embarrassed, be proud. You're doing something most guys would be afraid to do. The people you meet will respect you for that.I can't say that I've ever gotten my face done, but I have dressed up in drag a couple times. The first time was Halloween, so I had an easy excuse, and I was very surprised by how many people told me they admired the courage that it took to do that. So the second time was easy (theme party, it was just easier to play along with the theme if I went as a woman). There's nothing embarrassing about doing something nobody expects. In fact, the opposite is true. Stepping outside of society's expectations takes a lot more strength than most people have, and most people will recognize that. So go for it, and be proud that you're one of the few who will actually take that step. As for the people who might look down on you for it... well that's their problem, not yours.
