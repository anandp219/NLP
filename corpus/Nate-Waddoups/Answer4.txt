 No, that would be a suicide.The government isn't just the White House and the people in it, and the constitution isn't just a document. There are still powerful organizations - from the secret service to the FBI to the local police to every branch of the armed services - that would merely regard you as a criminal and would therefore treat you like one. You would almost certainly be killed within minutes, perhaps hours if you were very clever or lucky. Your only chance of leaving the White House alive (and it is a very slim chance) would be if you walked out with your hands up and cooperated with the people who would be handcuffing you. You would then die in prison, one way or another. The best outcome you could hope for would be to die in prison of old age, but in the unlikely event that you survived long enough to be arrested you'd probably end up with a lethal injection a few years later.
