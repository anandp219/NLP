 If you have never talked, she does not know that you love her.She might have noticed you behaving strangely, but that is not the same thing. People are terrible at understanding hints. They only know what you tell them.And if the first thing you tell her is that you love her, what you say next won't matter because she'll just be convinced that you don't know what love is. And she'll be right. Love only happens after two people get to know each other. Your face might be familiar to her, but if you haven't talked with her, your odds of getting married are still no different from those of any stranger.
