 It will certainly help the industry to have the legal issues resolved. But if that were to happen tomorrow, we would still have a couple more obstacles (in addition to batteries) preventing widespread adoption.In order to fly unsupervised in arbitrary environments, drones need to be able to detect and avoid obstacles. Detection is the hard part. We either need better sensor technology, or better software to interpret the output of existing sensors. For example, 3D sensors like Microsoft's Kinect can do a great job of mapping an environment, but they are still large, heavy, and power-hungry, and their range is limited. On the other hand, it is very common to put small, lightweight, low-power cameras on drones, but software that can create a model of the surrounding, suitable for use by navigation algorithms, is hard to come by. There are still PhD-level projects in progress to develop better sensors and better software.If the regulatory questions are resolved, I'd expect to see more funding put into these sorts of things, so solutions may not be far off. But until obstacle-avoidance is fully automated, drones will be limited to controlled environments and/or human-assisted operation.
