 My wife and I got our first front-loading machines a couple years ago, and we made the mistake of closing the door a couple times before we learned our lesson. With front-loaders, it takes almost no time at all to start smelling like a swamp. And then there's the challenge of getting the stink out.With the top-loaders that we had been using, leaving the door open was not such a big deal. We left the lid closed half the time and it was never an issue if the machine was empty. But if you leave a load of clothes in there overnight... or two nights... you don't want to wear them until they've been through another wash cycle or three. But it's still not as bad as a front-loader.
