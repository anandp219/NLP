 ...and correspondingly, why have previous generations been so nonchalant about social injustice and identity? Why did so many people, for so many years, think that it was OK to marginalize groups of people based on such arbitrary factors as race, religion, gender, sexual preference, and so on?The first thing to note is that this is not new. The "obsession" with righting pervasive wrongs goes back centuries. In the United States, arguments over slavery date back to at least the 1700s, and in the mid-1800s there were heated arguments over whether or not women should be allowed to vote. Sexual preference and gender identity are just the latest issues to be added to the list of things that only matter to bigots.There's a common bumper-sticker that says "If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention." More people are paying attention. Over time, more and more younger people have steadily recognized that it makes no sense to persecute people based on these arbitrary factors. And, at the risk of sounding morbid, older people who thought that such discrimination was acceptable or even beneficial have been steadily dying off.If the "obsession" is greater today than in the past, it is simply because the problems have been studied, discussed, and broadcast to society-at-large more effectively than ever before. And that in turn is just because the problems have been present for longer than ever before.
