 There are a few reasons... Any attack on the Kim regime would lead to massive casualties in South Korea because the North Korean army is prepared to launch massive amounts of artillery across the boarder. Also note that South Korea's capital city, Seoul, is located near the boarder, providing a target-rich environment for all of that artillery.The world watched as brutal regimes were dismantled in Afghanistan and Iraq not so long ago, and neither of those "regime changes" ended well. The Kim regime is responsible for the humanitarian crises of North Korea today. Nobody wants to be responsible for the crises of a Kim-less North Korea tomorrow.War in North Korea would likely trigger a massive refugee crisis, its neighbors (China and Korea) are not ready to handle. Consider the exodus from Syria into Europe, for example.Until relatively recently, it was assumed that China would come to North Korea's defense. Relatively recently, North Korea seems to have developed nuclear bombs. It probably does not have the ability to deliver them over long distances (e.g. with ICBMs) but it might be able to deliver them to coastal cities.Those last two items are far from certain, but either possibility is enough to deter would-be attackers. Combine those with the certain consequences (casualties in South Korea, refugees fleeing north and south) and uncertain consequences (things may not improve for the people of North Korea), and nobody wants to get involved.
