 Try karting instead. The speeds are lower, so it is somewhat less dangerous, but it still includes most of what makes car racing fun. You might find that it scratches the same itch for you.Also consider racing in ChumpCar World Series or LeMons. The cars are nowhere near as fast as your cars, but fast enough to be loads of fun, and the cars are safer due to the required roll cages, harnesses, etc. And the races are long. The shortest race that my friends and I have entered was 6 hours, the longest was 36. After about 90 minutes behind the wheel, it starts to feel more like work than play. But doing lap after lap for such a long duration gives you lots and lots of time to experiment with line choices and really learn a lot about racing.
