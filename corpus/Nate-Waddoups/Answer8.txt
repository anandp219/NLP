 Take a course that teaches when lethal force is and is not acceptable, and how to behave in a lethal-force situation.In my area there are courses named "General Defensive Handgun" offered by a couple of different schools - I haven't looked into where that term came from but I suspect it's a standard of some sort. They cover safe handling and shooting technique, but most of the class time was spent on legal questions and how to distinguish yourself from a murderer (in the eyes of police and bystanders) should you be forced to shoot.Time spent practicing at the range won't teach you this stuff. Much of what everybody knows is actually fiction. The recent incident of a vigilante shooting at a shoplifter is sounds like a pretty clear example of someone who knew much less about firearms than they thought they did. Unless new information comes to light, I'd expect the shooter to spend some time in jail, and lose their right to own firearms ever again (assault with a deadly weapon is a felony, and felons are prohibited). Fortunately, nobody got injured, crippled, or killed.
