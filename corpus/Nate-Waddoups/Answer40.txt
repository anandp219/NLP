 Yes, definitely. I'm certain that eventually automation will advance to a point where the cost of production for everything will drop to zero. Human effort, blue-collar or white-collar, will be literally worthless. But no cost of production will mean no cost of goods and services, which will mean no cost required to keep people comfortable. So while nobody will be able to get a job, that won't be a problem because nobody will need a job. I'm confident that humanity will reach that state eventually, but I am not confident that the transition will be a smooth one.Right now, most people work 4-5 decades to earn what they need to support themselves for another decade or three in retirement. If we're lucky, the working period will gradually shrink to nothing, and it'll be a smooth transition.If we're not lucky, jobs will disappear before prices fall enough to allow everyone to retire after little or no work. In between, we'll have poverty, suffering, and rioting.There are also some guaranteed minimum income experiments happening already. If we're lucky, that sort of thing will catch on quickly enough to avoid large-scale and/or long-term suffering. If we're not lucky, there will be decades of pervasive poverty before the powers-that-be realize that we need, as David S. Rose put it, "a complete rethinking of how we deal with sustenance."I want to be optimistic about this, but I'm not convinced that I should be.
