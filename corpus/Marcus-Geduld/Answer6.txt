 Our ancestors had to exercise. They had to engage in grueling physical labor in order to survive. They didn't have refrigerators; they didn't know how to farm; they couldn't buy food in stores or restaurants; there was no army or police force to protect them. Fear of death and the pains of hunger and thirst were strong-enough prompts to cause people to exercise. Evolution is not a goal-driven system. It does not purposefully try to endow us with positive feelings when we do something that's good for us. Rather, people who happen to have positive feelings about, say, mating, tend to have more children than people who don't. And they pass their positive feelings on to their many children.
