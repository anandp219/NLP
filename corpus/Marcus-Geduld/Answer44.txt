 That would be a waste of money. We can (and do) study the evolution of microorganisms here on Earth. It would be interesting to see how the Martian environment affected various terrestrial life forms, but it would also be interesting to see if Mars has its own life forms. We'd learn a lot by comparing their anatomy and behavior to Earth lifeforms. Contaminating mars might jeopardize that Science. There are also commercial implications. We often find uses for microorganisms, and we might find some for Martian ones. Contaminating them would put such projects at risk.
