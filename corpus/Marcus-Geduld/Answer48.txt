 Are you talking about a scientific theory? In the sciences, the word "theory" doesn't mean a hunch or a conjecture. It means an explanatory framework. Explanatory frameworks can be fact or fiction. Scientists use the word "hypothesis," not "theory," to mean "something that hasn't been proven yet." When a scientist talks about the Theory of Evolution, the Theory of Relativity, or quantum theory, he doesn't mean that those things are just conjectures. If that's what he meant, he'd call them hypotheses, not theories.
