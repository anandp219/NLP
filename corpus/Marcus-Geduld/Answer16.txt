 You can't, because there's no such thing as your questions. Questions on Quora belong to the community. Be aware of that. Understand that the moment you submit a question, your rights of ownership of it cease.If you write a question that's really similar to other, existing questions, it will probably get merged. If you want to give the a question as a gift to the community and make it unlikely that your gift will be merged, try to make your question unique. But it's kind of sucky to give gifts with strings attached to them.
