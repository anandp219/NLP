 I was an admin on this site for several years, and I never did what I wanted, which is why the site still has a boring white background instead of black with beige with polkadots. Sigh. I was not allowed to delete questions without a reason. I had to explain my reasoning to the other admins, and when doing so, I had to cite a specific policy. The site kept a record of every admin action I took, and other admins could (and did) read through it. Often, we didn't take action, because after a week or two of discussing a single question or answer, we couldn't agree about it.No, of course you don't have freedom on Quora. Who ever said you did. There are rules on the site--as there are on many sites--and you're expected to follow them. If you go to a "Star Wars" fan site and post a ten-thousand word essay on Rembrandt, you will get into trouble. That site has its rules; Quora has its. You're not free on either. You are free to stay here or leave.
