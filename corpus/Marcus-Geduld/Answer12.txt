 Yes. I don't generally eat mammals. That's an arbitrary decision, and it's not morally perfect, but I'm slowly crawling towards veganism. The exception to my no-mammal rule is when I or someone else makes a mistake. For instance, if I order cheese pizza and get pepperoni pizza by mistake, I'll go ahead and eat it. The animal is already dead; the pizza is already made. If I don't eat it, the restaurant will just throw it away. (I guess the best thing I could do in that circumstance is to give it to a homeless person, but I don't generally do that.)If I killed all my meat myself, mistakes like this would be extremely rare. They're already pretty rare, but they'd be rarer. Still, I'd probably stick to the same rules. If I was trying to kill a chicken and accidentally killed a cow, I would go ahead and eat it. What would be the point of letting it rot? (Though, again, the best option would be to give it to a hungry person.)
