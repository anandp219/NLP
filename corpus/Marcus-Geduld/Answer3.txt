 To be Big Brother, you need three things: 1. Rules that you impose on people.2. The ability to closely watch them and ensure they're following the rules.3. A means of keeping people from leaving. Quora has the first thing, a little bit of the second thing, and none of the third thing. So, no, their admins are not Big Brother. (If Winston Smith could have just left Oceania, Orwell wouldn't have had a novel.)There are two ways people tend to define "censorship."1. Editorial curation, limited to a single publication (e.g. "Newsweek" refusing to publish sci-fi stories.2. A government stopping citizens from being able to express certain ideas. Via the first definition, Quora regularly engages in censorship--as do all sites, magazines, publishing houses, forums, etc that have any sort of editorial policies or rules.
