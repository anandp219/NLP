 Man derives from a proto-germanic word, which meant "person," not "male person." When Old English snatched the world, its meaning became more restrictive, but it still retained its original meaning as an alternative definition, e.g. "the dawn of man." Wikipedia suggests ...The spelling of woman in English has progressed over the past millennium from wfmann[1] to wmmann to wumman, and finally, the modern spelling woman.[2] In Old English,wfmann meant "female human", whereas wr meant "male human". Mann or monn had a gender-neutral meaning of "human", corresponding to Modern English "person" or "someone"; however, subsequent to the Norman Conquest, man began to be used more in reference to "male human", and by the late 13th century had begun to eclipse usage of the older term wr.[3] The medial labial consonants f and m in wfmann coalesced into the modern form "woman", while the initial element, which meant "female", underwent semantic narrowing to the sense of a married woman ("wife"). It is a popular misconception that the term "woman" is etymologically connected with "womb", which is from a separate Old English word, wambe meaning "stomach" (of male or female;"Male" and "female" are more tenuously linked, despite their similar sounds and spelling. "Male" derives from the Latin word "masculus," whereas "female" derives from "femella," also Latin. "fe" is not a prefix tacked onto the beginning of male.
