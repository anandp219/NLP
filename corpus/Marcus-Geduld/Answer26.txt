 The ethics are the same regardless of sex. I am not allowed to lie to my wife. And according to my ethics, lying by omission counts as lying. (I can't excuse my behavior by saying, "She didn't ask.") There are no "she drove me to it" exceptions. I'm only allowed to use "drove me to it" when I'm trapped, and marriage is not a trap--at least not where I live. I am free to divorce my wife any time I want. (I also freely chose to get married in the first place.) It really doesn't matter what she does: yell at me all the time, refuse to have sex with me, cheat on me with 15 different men. All of those things would be moral lapses on her part, but her moral lapses don't excuse mine. If I cheat on my wife, it's my fault. If she cheats on me, it's her fault. If we have problems in our marriage--problems that entice me to cheat--that's probably both our faults. The problems our our fault, not my way of dealing with them. I need to take responsibility for that. My wife needs to take responsibility for the ways she deals the problems, too.
