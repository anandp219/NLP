 We'd wind up with a police state. That's what we'd need if such laws were enforced. Throughout history, people (in all cultures) have had extramarital sex. The law has always been a blunt instrument when it comes to changing people's sexual habits. Prostitution is illegal in most places, and yet that doesn't stop it from being a widely practiced, lucrative trade. Teenagers keep having sex despite countless attempts to stop them. Gay folks have copious sex, even in countries where homosexuality is illegal. So we'd need massive amounts of surveillance, including keeping watch on people inside their private homes, which is where most sex (premarital or otherwise) takes place. And since sex is such a powerful driver, we'd need extremely severe penalties (e.g. death, torture, or extremely lengthy prison* sentences) to counter it. * And we'd have to continue the surveillance in prison, to stop the inmates from having premarital sex.
