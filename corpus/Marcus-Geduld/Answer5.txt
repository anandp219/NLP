 Are you asking when women stop looking like the "hot chicks" you see in movies? If so, we should start by noting that most women don't look like them to begin with. Here's the best answer I can give you: if we show people photos of 1,000 women--each of whom is displayed at various stages of her life--and demand that all the viewers classify when the women changed from being "hot chicks" to an "old ladies," refusing to let viewers use any other categories, my guess is that we'd get a range from about 35 and 60, depending on the individual woman. It's impossible to be more specific, because people age at very different rates, and even two people aging at the same rate often look wildly different from each other, due to genetic differences, dietary differences, and so on. My friends (male and female) are mostly in their 40s, 50s, and 60s, and it's amazing how varied they look. Some of the 60-year-olds look younger than some of the 40 year olds. I have friends from high school who still look pretty much like they did back then, 35 years ago. I have others who look elderly. And I have many whose looks are somewhere between those extremes.Answers also will depend on the age of the viewer. Many folks in their teens and early 20s think 40-year-olds look like old people. To me, most of them look young and many 20-year-olds look like children.
