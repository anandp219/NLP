 First, let's be clear that many married men don't have mistresses. Some of us don't even want them. If my wife said, "Please. Have a mistress. I want you to!" I wouldn't do it. Of the ones who do, the causes are varied. Some men enjoy the ego boost they get from knowing multiple women will sleep with them; others are addicted to "the chase" and get bored when a relationship gets too settled; some love variety; some want to connect with another person in ways (possibly but not necessarily sexual) they feel they can't connect with their wives; some want to get caught--usually because they are scared of intimacy and the longer their marriages endure, the more certain they are they'll end; and some are angry at their wives and want to get even; some just want lots and lots of sex, possibly with more than one person. Some simply form a bond with another woman. Being in a relationship doesn't necessarily mean that can't happen. All of the above reasons apply to women who have affairs, too.
