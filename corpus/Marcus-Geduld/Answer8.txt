 Because sight is more complex than we tend to think. Seeing an apple isn't something you just do with your eyes. Your eyes capture certain data, but by the time you become conscious of the apple, its image is enhanced or tarnished by all sorts of other data. If a perfect-looking apple smells bad, it will probably look less-than perfect to you. If I tell you it's actually a fake apple, and that it's made out of wax stuffed with fecal matter, it will look worse still. If you have a standard human brain, you won't just think, "It looks delicious, but it's actually disgusting." It will start to look disgusting to you. If it's a real (non-rotten) apple, and your best friend gave it to you, it will look better to you (and probably taste better) than an identical apple from the store. Many owners of a Picasso painting will like it less if they discover it's a forgery, even if they initially loved it for its colors and shapes, not because it was painted by a famous artist. Nothing intrinsic to a painting changes after you discover it's a fake. The way something looks is a creation of your brain, not your eyes. Sight plays a role, but the final result is a composite--and it's not stable. If you one day find out that the man you like is a pedophile, he may stop being attractive to you, even though his looks won't have changed. You won't see him as a good-looking child molester; you won't see him as an average-looking one, either. You'll see him as an ugly one. Looks matter to most of us, but mostly as a default. Our experiences and knowledge of a person change our first impressions.
