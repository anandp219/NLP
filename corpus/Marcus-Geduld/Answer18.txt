 It's incoherent. Everything is natural. It's impossible for us to create matter out of nothing, so everything we make is made out of ingredients from nature. If you define "unnatural" as "altered by humans," then a carrot is unnatural as soon as you dig it up. Carrots in the wild don't dig themselves up. Perhaps "natural" means "something we haven't altered very much." In which case you have to avoid all domesticated plants and animals. Pears are unnatural, brussel sprouts are unnatural, cows are unnatural, chickens are unnatural. These are all life forms we've hugely altered through centuries of selective breeding. (Is a beaver's dam unnatural? After all, the beaver built it. It's an artifact. Or is it natural because something built by an animal is natural? If so, then a helicopter is natural, because it too was built by an animal--in this case a primate.)There are some "natural" things--things untouched by human hands--that you can experience if you want. You can, for instance, wait until lightning catches a forest on fire and then go running naked through the flames. You can go swimming in the arctic ocean. You can tease a cobra until it bites you...The truth is that various substances affect our bodies in various ways. Some "natural" substances help us; some "natural" substances harm us; many "natural" substances help us in some ways and harm us in others; some "unnatural" substances help us; others harm us; and many others do both.
