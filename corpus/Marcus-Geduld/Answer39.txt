 My wife and I are a good example of this. I don't know that I'm ugly, but I'm definitely not in her league, and I was even further from it when we met 22 years ago. She was the blonde babe who regularly turned heads. I was the nerd who never had a girlfriend in high school.We met in graduate school and quickly became best friends. No one else shared our senses of humor, and few people shared our interests. We were both studying theatre and intended to spend our lives working on plays; we were both atheists; we were both fascinated by horror movies and ghost stories; we were both extreme animal lovers; etc. (I could list 40 more things.) Two decades into our marriage, we agree on almost everything, and it was pretty clear that would be true from the start. Like I said, I'm probably more nerdy-looking than ugly (as best as I can judge myself), but it doesn't matter. I could have been five times uglier or five times better looking. Same with my wife. It was nice that she was so attractive, but I would have happily married her even if she'd come down with a nasty skin condition and gained 200lbs. (By the way, I'm not rich, and since my interest was theatre, my wife knew it was unlikely I'd ever be rich.)There are other things besides looks that matter to certain people, and not just to women. I'm certainly affected by physical beauty, but I would date a less-physically-attractive woman who shares my interests, values, and sense-of-humor over a more-attractive one that doesn't. In fact, there's no amount of beauty that would make up for huge personality differences. Show me a supermodel who is bored by art, has no sense of humor, and is always angry, and I'll say, "Thanks but no thanks."
