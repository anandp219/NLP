 Science doesn't "support" things. Science uses evidence to build theories and then uses those theories to make predictions. Our current physical model (very roughly speaking) assumes that events in the Universe are caused by a chain of events originating in the Big Bang and are influenced by quantum randomness. There's no evidence of any other sort of force--anything that can override, stand-apart-from, or be another influence besides--the forces mentioned above. So the parsimonious assumption is that (libertarian) free will doesn't exist (or isn't needed to explain anything). But though Science tends to use parsimony, Science isn't parsimony, and neuroscience is still in its infancy. It's hard to say much, scientifically, about human will since we understand so little about human consciousness. We don't even have an agreed-upon definition of it.
