 No. My OCD-ish tendencies are mostly related to sensory overload. For instance, I'll adjust the TV volume dozens of times during a show, because it it's just slightly louder or softer than my comfort zone, I can't handle it. I do this whether I'm stressed or unstressed. I also have some germaphobe issues, mostly related to public bathrooms. Before sitting on a toilet, I spend time wiping it down, even if there doesn't appear to be anything on it. And I have a few other irrational bathroom habits. I always do this stuff, whether I'm stressed or relaxed.
