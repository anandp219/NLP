 Pauling isn't really famous for being a chemist. Not that he was any slouch in chemistry: his Nobel prize was for critical work on the nature of atomic bonding. But I doubt anybody who isn't a chemist actually remembers that.Pauling is famous for being an activist, educator, and communicator. He won a second Nobel prize for his peace work. Otherwise, he'd be barely known outside the field, and that work helps raise awareness within the field of his work. His original Nobel prize helped make him influential in getting scientists on board with nuclear activism; so did the widespread use of his book on the subject. I don't know Herman Branson. Maybe his story deserves to be better told; maybe it doesn't. Perhaps he's another Rosalind Franklin, who definitely deserved a Nobel prize and definitely deserves to be better known. But even if Branson's claims are correct, he's just one of a vast number of scientists of all stripes who just didn't manage to be in the right place at the right time for the Nobel committee. If so, race probably did play a factor. The Nobel awards are matters of opinion, and popularity contests themselves, not objective measures of greatness and importance.Branson may well have done the critical piece of work on the alpha helix, and it's hard to say what he might have done with a Nobel prize if it had been given to him. But Pauling is duly famous both inside and outside the field of chemistry, albeit for different reasons. That doesn't really amount to making him "the greatest chemist ever", a title which probably belongs to somebody I've never even heard of. But he is certainly the most influential chemist ever, which Branson definitely wasn't.If you're asking me to say that Pauling wasn't kind of a dick... yeah, he was definitely a dick. Lots of Nobelists are. His later blathering about Vitamin C was the stuff of crankery... not that he's the only Nobelist to become a science crank. There's a good article on RationalWiki called Nobel disease, and it's pretty sobering (albeit a bit overblown; Einstein wasn't really a supporter of Wilhelm Reich, and the Pauli effect was a joke. Still... there is plenty of genuinely horrible crap on that list).
