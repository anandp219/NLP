 The question is conflating like nine different things. Having been asked to answer I'll try to untangle it briefly.Nearer the big bang, space as a whole was more highly curved, and I don't know if orbits could have formed. Now, space is nearly flat, and you can make some simplifying assumptions about the curvature of space. The math is boring, but basically it shows that under nearly flat space it simplifies to Newton's laws, and those laws have stable solutions corresponding to orbits. As for "negating the effects of gravity"... gravity doesn't get negated. Gravity exerts a small curve into an object's natural tendency to move straight forward. When it's moving at just the right speed, the object's sideways move due to gravity plus the forward move due to momentum leaves it at exactly the same distance as it was before, just a bit ahead and to the side. Under classical theory that sideways move is interpreted as a force; under general relativity it's interpreted as a curve in space. It's more or less the same thing; the GR version is more elegant but involves slightly more advanced math.Whichever you pick, gravity isn't "negated". It's that the speed in one direction exactly matches the speed in the other so that the net effect is zero change in distance from the planet (or whatever you're orbiting), but that's the only thing that goes to zero. You're still moving, and moving in a curved path, which wouldn't happen if there weren't any gravity.
