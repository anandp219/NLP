 Nothing. At least, nothing that's not also wrong with "natural" flavors.Artificial flavors tend to be purer, which makes the flavor less complex. Sometimes, that can be useful: in some applications artificial vanilla works better than natural vanilla because it carries the primary vanilla note more clearly.There's nothing toxic about them. They are usually purer forms of flavors found in the natural world, chemically identical. There's nothing especially safe about the natural versions. Some natural flavors, like Coumarin, have been banned from food for being dangerous. Which is too bad; it's an excellent flavor, more vanilla-y than vanilla. It's only in large doses that it's dangerous; the synthetic version is used safely as a blood thinner, in controlled dosages. Both artificial and natural flavors are used within guidelines generally recognized as safe.Both natural and artificial flavors are used in highly processed foods, which should be limited in your diet, because they contain high concentrations of calories and low amounts of other nutrients. Using the natural flavors doesn't make those foods any more "natural"; they still tend to have things like concentrated sugars and starches, and industrially-grown meats with unbalanced fat ratios. You would probably be healthier eating more "whole", unprocessed foods... and neither natural nor artificial flavors contribute to that.Consumers have a distaste for the "artificial" label, and food processors generally seek out the "natural" ones, but it's not really helping. Sometimes it does help the food taste better, by providing more complex tastes, but it's not improving the nutrition.
