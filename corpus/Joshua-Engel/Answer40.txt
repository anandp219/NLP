 As this article says:Sorry, Back to the Future Fans. Youre Never Getting a Real Hoverboard.the short answer is "not really". Gravity itself simply doesn't work that way; if we discover an alternative theory of gravity that allows something like this, hoverboards will be the least of the things that come of it.You can play all kinds of fancy games with magnetic repulsion, but since the ground isn't magnetic, you can't get a general-purpose hoverboard like the kind depicted in the movie. You can build tracks, and at least in theory we might one day develop room-temperature superconductors to take advantage of them, but it won't allow the kinds of freedom of movement that you saw in the film. Such things also tend to be extremely squirrely; I won't say it'll be impossible for a controller to manage it, but I consider it pretty unlikely.
