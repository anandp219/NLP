 As far as I can tell, nobody has ever given this footnote a moment's thought. This was written in 1920, and since then, quantum electrodynamics has provided the electrodyanmic theory that Einsten felt was missing. It does not allow for "electrical masses" that need to be held together by additional forces. They are excitations of the electromagnetic field under the U(1) gague symmetry. This is a formulation completely unknown to Einstein at the time he wrote this (and indeed, was not developed until just before his death). It incorporates the length contraction that Einstein was referring to in his footnote without needing to assign any structure to the electron. Instead, it is a property of the quantum field, as viewed from the reference frame.To my knowledge (via a review of the literature in Google Scholar), nobody has ever done any work on Einstein's guess. And in the intervening years, general relativity has moved farther away from quantum mechanics. It's possible that a unified theory might in the end give general relativity some kind of role to play in whatever structure electrons might turn out to have. But for the moment, theory predicts that electrons have no structure, and indeed cannot have an structure. The footnote appears to have been an fragment of an idea that went nowhere at all.
