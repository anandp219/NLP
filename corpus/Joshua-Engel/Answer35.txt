 Karl Teigen won a IgNobel Prize in 2001 for work on this. Is a sigh "just a sigh"? Sighs as emotional signals and responses to a difficult task. The conclusion: " sighs are often unintentional expressions of an activity, plan or desire that has to be discarded, creating a pause before it can be replaced by a novel initiative."A slightly less ridiculous study concludes that it's about making respiration more regular during times of emotional strain that would otherwise cause irregular breathing:Sigh rate and respiratory variability during mental load and sustained attentionThat's not much in the way of data, and of course there's never much to answer when it comes to "why" in biology. My suspicion is that it's largely about the constriction of the throat in response to stress, combined with a large exhalation either after or following a large intake of air, preparing or finishing some task. This presumably also manifests as a social signal, reinforcing the gesture.
