 For starters, see Is [this food] healthy? by Craig Good on Assorted Topics Primer. It's not really apt to say that white rice and white flour are "unhealthy". They're just sources of very dense calories without a lot of other nutrition. You need some calories. As long as your total calorie consumption isn't too high, both foods are perfectly fine.They're not unhealthy; there are no side effects.What one can say is that whole-grain rice and whole-grain wheat are generally better choices: they have a variety of minerals, vitamins, and fiber. They may also be more satisfying to eat, since they're digested a bit more slowly, while piles of pure starch tend to hit you more quickly. So if you nudge your diet more towards whole grains and away from processed ones, you might get some benefits. I can't say what benefits without know what, if anything, is wrong with you. If your diet is balanced and you're feeling healthy, the odds are pretty good you can continue to eat as much white rice and white flour as you have been. (OK, it might help to get into the habit of eating more whole grains while you're younger, since your body will gradually slow down and it'll be easier to maintain if you already have good habits.)
