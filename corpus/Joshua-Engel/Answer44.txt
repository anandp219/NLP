 According to Neil deGrasse Tyson, the concept originated in 1783 with John Michell, a parson and lecturer at Cambridge. John Michell and Black HolesIt was first mentioned in a letter to Henry Cavendish and published by the Royal Society, which you can read at:John Michell's 1783 "Black Hole" paper"Pierre-Simon LaPlace came up with the idea independently in 1796 in Exposition du systme du monde.(Note: the question originally referred to "black stars". From the description, I believe that the concept of "dark star" is the one that was intended. A dark star is similar to a black hole, derived using classical gravity, for an object whose density is so great that its classical escape velocity exceeds the speed of light. There is a nice comparison of the two concepts at Would it be wrong to derive Schwarzschild radius using classical physics?)
