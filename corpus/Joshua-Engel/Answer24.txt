 If the lottery is properly designed, then "no". The whole point of a properly designed lottery is that it pays out less than it takes in. If it were mathematically possible for one person to beat that, then other people could as well, and the lottery would lose money.It is possible to use math to determine if a lottery is improperly designed. That's what happened in the Cash WinFall lottery. It had a fairly complex system to ensure that it didn't take in too much money, and some weeks it would pay out more than it took in. If you can determine that, you can beat the lottery.A lottery game with a windfall for a knowing fewThe simpler the lottery is, the easier it is to ensure that it's correctly designed. So when you say "win the lottery", you're referring to some abstract "pick N random numbers" game. Lotteries publish odds, and it's fairly each to check that the payout is less than the odds of winning. That is, you might have a 1 in 10,000 chance of winning $5,000. You will lose that game, unless their random number generator is broken.That has been known to happen, but lotteries have staffs that check the ball machines (or whatever they're using). They can do the math as well as you can (better, probably) to check that the payouts are less than the ticket price. Screw-ups do happen, especially since real-world lotteries often have unnecessary complications (which are supposed to make the game more fun, but usually make the odds even worse for you). But there's no general mathematical tool for predicting the ways that people screw up. You have to look for it, and it's going to be so rare that it's probably more profitable to get a real job with your math skills.If you do want to play a random game where you're actually pitting your math skills against other players, you can try poker. But the odds are you're not the smartest person at the table. There is a sucker at every table, who you can profit from. But if you don't know who it is, it's you.
