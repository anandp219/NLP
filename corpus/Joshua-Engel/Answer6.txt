 It's a form of mis-generalization, not entirely different from the process that gives us "irregardless".English absorbs words from many different languages. Sometimes, it absorbs just the root and forms plurals in the regular way. Other times, it imports both the word and the plural, yielding irregular plurals.Some Greek words ending in "-is" form the plural by adding a vowel, "-eis". When filtered through American pronunciation, this becomes "eez". For example, the plural of "analysis" is "analyses", pronounced "analaseez". The same holds for "parentheses", "appendices", and "emphases". and There is also a similar Latin transformation that imports the plural of "matrix" as "matrices"For "process", we did not import the Latin plural along with the word (which would be "processus"). But the spelling "processes" resembles words like "analyses" and "matrices", and some people incorrectly infer a similar pronunciation rule. A similar mis-generalization affects "biases", from a French root.It's not "wrong", exactly. This is English, which is a mishmash of irregular forms and irregular pronunciations. "Standard English" is a consensus; when the consensus breaks down, the standard changes. "Processeez" is considered a nonstandard pronunciation by most dictionaries, presumably because that particular mis-generalization is restricted to certain areas. It would make sense (but I have no data) if it's more common among technical people who get more exposure to words with Greek roots. (Greek words in English tend to have a technical feel; they were imported primarily in academic contexts.) I'm sure it'll prove yet another pet peeve among language prescriptivists because "being peeved" is what prescriptivists do. But actual dictionary makers are more interested in documenting what words (and pronunciations) catch people's ear rather than trying to hold back the ocean of language change.
