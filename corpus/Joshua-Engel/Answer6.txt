 A movie doesn't need a message. In fact, it probably shouldn't have one. Tolkien explicitly disavowed having one in The Lord of the Rings:As for any inner meaning or 'message', it has in the intention of the author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical.Films are there to entertain. The Lord of the Rings and 300 do so in very different ways. I'd say that they actually have practically nothing to do with each other. If there is some trope that's common to the two of them ("sacrifice"), it's something they have in common with thousands of other films. The same tropes come up over and over because they are entertaining. It's not a "message" you need to hear from either film, since it's one you've already heard. Rather, it's a theme that's interesting to hear about, and it can be dressed up in wildly varying guises. Different forms will appeal to different people, and that's just fine. If you don't like 300, don't go see it. It's not the filmmaker's job to tell you what to see. It's the job of the movie reviewer, and I thought they did a pretty good job of telling me what to expect from 300. (I didn't expect to like it... and I didn't. I'm not even sure why I went. But that's on me, not on the filmmaker.)
