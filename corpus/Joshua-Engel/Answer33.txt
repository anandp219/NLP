 The Noldor didn't hinder Melkor's quest to rule Middle-earth. Before the Valar returned, he did control Middle-earth. Morgoth was kept bottled up for a few centuries after the Dagor Aglareb, but even that couldn't hold him all that long. All three Elven strongholds were destroyed. The one he couldn't destroy himself was destroyed for him by a combination of the Dwarves and the Noldor.The houses of Beor, Hador, and Haleth did some good work harassing Morgoth's troops, and if Thingol and Melian could have been convinced to help them, it's possible that they could have kept Morgoth at bay. Some of the greatest heroes of the first age were Men (Beren and Turin), and Luthien and Beleg were Sindar, not Noldor. Morgoth was always predisposed to cowardice. Despite his power he rarely showed his face. But his armies grew stronger all through the First Age, while Elves and Men seemed to roughly hold steady. Morgoth's dragons grew bigger, and eventually even flew. It's unlikely that the Eagles would have held them off.So I'd say the Noldor didn't really hinder Morgoth all that much. Perhaps Men and Sindar (and Eagles and Ents) would have stepped up; perhaps they would have been wiped out 500 years sooner than they were. But the true hope of Middle-earth lay in the West, and there was no chance of defeating Morgoth without them.
