 The scene exists solely in the movie; it is not a scene from the book. The lyrics are taken from a completely different scene.I thought the music was haunting, and Boyd sang it beautifully. The moment was quite affecting. However, I didn't care for the way it depicted Denethor as a gluttonous tyrant and a horrible father. Denethor is not a monster; he was in fact a wise ruler. His fault was in giving in to despair, a serious no-no in Catholicism and in Tolkien's world. I don't necessarily disapprove of changing the character from the book. This issue of faith is pretty abstruse, better handled in the contemplative nature of a book rather than the go-go-go nature of a film. Jackson also sought ways to cut the larger-than-life characters down to make the book more of an epic and less of a myth; that choice I am less sanguine about, but I understand it.But I think he went too far with Denethor, and I feel that that scene in particular suffered for it. It doesn't humanize Denethor to turn him into a cartoon villain. Instead of an opportunity to engender real grief for a human whose fault is very similar to our own, we feel contempt for Denethor. His death seems like comeuppance, a pretty shallow emotion. Jackson should have aimed for better. All he needed in that scene was to feel what we feel during that song, the heartbreak of a father and ruler who has just sent men to die in a necessary cause, helpless and forlorn. We would understand his despair, and instead of greeting his death with "Good", we'd say, "Wow, poor thing." That's a much worthier and more interesting emotion, not to mention better in keeping with the book.
