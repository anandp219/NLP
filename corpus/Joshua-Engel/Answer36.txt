 Yes, but mostly insofar as it helps you understand that the notion of "origin of the universe" isn't as clear as the expression makes it sound.People have a strong intuitive notion that mass and time and space and momentum are well defined concepts, and that you can meaningfully say things like "An object is here at time t, therefore at t-1 it must have been over there." And that's perfectly reasonable for everything you've ever encountered.But the world of the very, very small doesn't work like that. "Exact time" and "exact position" don't actually exist. What does exist is a harder-to-grasp thing called a "wave function", to which you can apply operators like "position" and "momentum" and get out a range of answers. Those answers just happen to turn into ordinary notions of time and space at large scales, with single values, but at small scales they are actually functions. That's what the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle tells you. Wrestling with that puts you in a better position to understand why your intuitive notions of what it means to be "the origin of the universe" need to be dismissed if you're ever going to get to what you actually want to know.Unfortunately, while it's a helpful tool for building better intuitions, it's not nearly sufficient to understand what the universe was like at the very earliest times. When the density is sufficiently high, the HUP doesn't exactly apply, either. That's an approximation that works at relatively low energy levels, like you see now. But it has to be replaced with something different to understand even something like the conditions inside the LHC, much less the early universe. That "replacement" isn't nearly as neatly expressed as the uncertainty principle, at least not without forms of mathematics that few are familiar with.So studying quantum mechanics is the best way to learn to ask the right questions and get on the right path, but it's not the whole answer.
