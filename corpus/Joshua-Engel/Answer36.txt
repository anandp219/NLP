 "Symptoms" is a funny way to put it, since that's usually used for medical conditions). It's going to vary from food to food. (I assume you're talking about food here, rather than Frostbite. Frostbite is what happens when your flesh freezes. It does have symptoms, but it's not the same thing as freezer burn, which is what happens when food is frozen for too long.)Freezer burn will vary from food to food. When food is frozen, cells burst, and the water comes out. That water gradually sublimates (turns directly to gas), even at very cold temperatures. There can also be some oxidation; chemical reactions are slowed at cold temperatures, but not stopped.That shows up as discoloration and a dried-out texture. The food generally isn't unsafe, just unpleasant to eat.
