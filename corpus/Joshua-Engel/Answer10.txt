 The field of "philosophy" has diversified. A lot of things that used to be called "philosophy" are given other names: economics, psychology, even science and politics. Two hundred years ago, anybody who is now a TV pundit might have been called a philosopher. So would Stephen Hawking. So, for that matter, would Deepak Chopra, which is actually kinda the point. When any piece of crap can be "philosophy", people tend to go looking for the particlar domains that are less crap-ridden.When people say "philosophy" they usually mean "metaphysics". But really, I'm not sure that metaphysics ever got all that much recognition. You can probably name, what, less than a dozen metaphysicists in the past couple of thousand years? There have been lots more, but they made little mark at the time, and are remembered today primarily only by other philosophers.The other thing often called "philosophy" is "ethics", or more generally, the how-to-live-your-life branch of philosophy. There are actually a great many people doing that. They just don't call themselves "philosophers", and they don't get academic degrees in it because... well, because that would be a lot of work for not a whole lot of payoff. There are some ethics professors who get some radio airtime (like Peter Singer), or meaning-of-life philosophers like David Chalmers (whose work I consider a vapid pile of drivel and a stain on academic philosophy).So there are lots of philosophers. It's just that the famous ones aren't called philosophers. There's actually some very good work being done, in an incremental way that doesn't attract much attention. They're not going to be famous, but historically speaking, practically none ever were.
