 No, it didn't rot, it oxidized. The red color of meat is caused by myoglobin. The myoglobin degrades over time, especially on exposure to oxygen, turning brown. You bought it in a package that was flushed with modified air to keep it bright red. (Sometimes including a small amount of carbon monoxide, which isn't harmful but can cause meat to appear fresh even after it has degraded.) When you opened the package, parts of it were exposed in a way that caused it to degrade the myoglobin.It was going to turn gray when you cooked it anyway. Ideally, you can cover that gray up by turning it a beautiful shade of golden brown by exposing it to high heat. But usually, the parts between the grill marks are a shade of gray, for the same reason.Photo by Chef floWer, Chef Flowers How Do I Make Grill Marks On A Steak? Recipe - Food.com
