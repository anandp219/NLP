 The "observer effect" in quantum physics is generally confused with the Uncertainty principle, which is a more rigorous and better-defined idea.The "observer effect" is a classical notion that you have to interact with something to get data out of it, and that that interaction will of necessity have some kind of effect. Often, the effect is small enough to ignore, though on quantum scales it's it's hard to make something "small enough to ignore". Neutrinos don't particularly help you achieve that goal, because the size of their rest mass isn't particularly relevant. They carry far more energy than that; the rest mass is so small a fraction of it that we've never managed to measure it. We only know that it exists at all because massless particles can't change their type like that, but all that tells us is that the mass is non-zero.The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is different from the observer effect. The uncertainty in momentum and position are fundamental, not properties of the observation. That is, it's not just that the measurement disturbs the particle (although it does). It's that the momentum and position are literally not well defined; they exist as a range. Via interaction you can narrow one down, at the cost of increasing the uncertainty in the other, but both will retain some uncertainty. That interaction is not necessarily an "observation".That minimum uncertainty is a fundamental constant of the universe. No matter how small your probes are, you can't circumvent them. Even if they could, neutrinos are poor choices for it, because they don't interact with things very much. It's incredibly hard to observe neutrinos; the overwhelming majority of them pass right through the entire earth.
