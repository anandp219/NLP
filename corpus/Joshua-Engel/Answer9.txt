 The Dagor Dagorath as described in the unpublished version of the Quenta Silmarillion is not canon, but there are references to a Last Battle in the Silmarillion:Menelmacar with his shining belt. that forebodes the Last Battle that shall be at the end of days.But Ar-Pharazn the King and the mortal warriors that had set foot upon the land of Aman were buried under falling hills: there it is said that they lie imprisoned in the Caves of the Forgotten, until the Last Battle and the Day of Doom. We get a few passing notions to a remaking of the world, presumably at the end:But their joy in victory was diminished, for they returned without the Silmarils from Morgoth's crown, and they knew that those jewels could not be found or brought together again unless the world be broken and remade.for the history was incomplete and the circles of time not full-wrought when the vision was taken away. And some have said that the vision ceased ere the fulfillment of the Dominion of Men and the fading of the Firstborn; wherefore, though the Music is over all, the Valar have not seen as with sight the Later Ages or the ending of the WorldAnd there are similar ideas. So we know, more or less, that the world does come to an end, and it probably does have something to do with Morgoth:And thou, Melkor, wilt discover all the secret thoughts of thy mind, and wilt perceive that they are but a part of the whole and tributary to its glory... And thou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.There's no suggestion of a battle in which Turin returns to kill Morgoth. As far as the canon is concerned Turin is just another Man, dead and gone beyond the circles of the world. But it's a world that does end, and somewhere in there Morgoth will discover what it was all about.
