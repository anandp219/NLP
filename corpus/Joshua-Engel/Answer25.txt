 If you get frostbite of a vital organ, certainly.More often, one gets frostbite on fingers and toes, and sometimes the limbs. This won't kill you directly, but it's very easy for gangrene to set in. That's an infection of the dead tissue, which can cause sepsis and death. That's a rather protracted (and nasty) death.Frostbite is debilitating, making it harder to save yourself when you're stuck out in the cold. That makes it much easier for you to die of hypothermia. You can die of hypothermia quite quickly, within hours (or even minutes if you're wet).
