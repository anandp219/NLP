 Yes, though only because people eat so much refined sugar. You can get cavities equally well from unrefined sugars, from natural sugars in fruits, and even from starches (which are turned into sugar in your mouth by enzymes in your saliva). But it's relatively rare these days for people to eat just those things and not refined sugars, so that's the main cause of their cavities. If they ditched the sugars they'd get fewer cavities, but not zero, since the other foods also feed the bacteria that produce the cavity-causing acids.Proper brushing with a fluoride toothpaste will dramatically reduce cavities. (Fluoride is also present in the water in many countries, which has contributed to an overall dramatic reduction in the cavity rate.)
