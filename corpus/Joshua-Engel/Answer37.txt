 If it's Turing complete, then it's equivalent to a language with conditional statements. There will exist some transformation from a language that does have conditional statements to the language in question.You can code that up in an arbitrary number of ways. For example, the SKI combinator calculus is Turing complete, and there's nothing obviously corresponding to a conditional in its three functions:Ix=xKxy=xSxyz=xz(yz)From here, you can implement NOT=(SK)(K), and K corresponds to an OR structure. A conditional A->B is (NOT A OR B). So whether the conditional is "there" or not is a matter of semantics.You can even implement this with just one structure , e.g.:x=xSKSee Iota and Jot
