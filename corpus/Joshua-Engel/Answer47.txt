 Because right now they are reducing in size, not increasing. The US is mostly pulling out of Iraq and Afghanistan. What's remaining behind is largely military trainers, who are experienced soldiers, not recent draftees.Army details how it will cut to its smallest size since before World War IIThe US seems to operate best with an all-volunteer military. (Volunteer means "willing", i.e. "not drafted", rather than "unpaid".) Being a soldier has become an increasingly technical task, requiring a lot of training and expertise. It's best done by dedicated personnel who want to be there and will be there for at least four years. You can't just take a civilian, hand him a gun for a year, and expect him to serve well. That hadn't worked well 40 years ago, and it works even less well now.So the US is reducing its military presence and has no need of additional soldiers, much less cranky short-timers. A draft would be wildly counterproductive.
