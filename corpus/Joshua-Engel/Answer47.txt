 [Answer changed now that I've seen the movie]The potatoes were alive, and edible, but the soil was sterilized by the extreme cold snap. That meant that the necessary soil bacteria were killed.I'm not entirely sure that that's accurate, since the whole thing was seeded with the contents of the latrine, which had already been kept freeze-dried outside. Plus he still had himself, and soil bacteria do multiply on their own. The nitrogen compounds were still present. So I'm not entirely sure if this makes sense, but it would be pretty difficult to start over from scratch.
