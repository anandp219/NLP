 The only useful data point we have is in the passage that Jeremiah Burns quoted:And thou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.Basically it means, "Yeah, you think it sucks, but there's a Plan. Really. Trust me." Which is largely the Catholic theodicy that appears throughout Tolkien's work. You have to have Faith. Not just "faith" that you have reason that things will work out (in Elvish "amdir", from manuscripts not published during his lifetime), but Faith that things will work out despite a very good reason to think that they won't (Elvish "Estel", which is familiar as Aragorn's nickname). Tolkien was big on "eucastastrophe", "the sudden happy turn in a story which pierces you with a joy that brings tears". He used the term mostly to describe stories, but he's also talking about religious faith: The Birth of Christ is the eucatastrophe of Man's history. It's the undeserved salvation granted by God.None of this makes a lot of sense to somebody who doesn't already believe... which is kind of the point by definition. The argument at that point becomes as much epistemological as theological; there's reasoning around an idea that specifically calls for no reason. But within the fictional world, it's as good an answer as any. We have "firsthand" information that Iluvatar has a plan, even though nobody knows what it is.
