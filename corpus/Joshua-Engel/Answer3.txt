 Among physicists, the answer is "neither one". General relativity and quantum mechanics have differing views of time, but neither one of them is usefully classed as either "real" or an illusion. In both, guided by special relativity, time is inextricably linked to space; the portion of "spacetime" as time and which is space is determined by relative motion. Relativistic quantum mechanics preserves this via Lorentz invariance. Fully handling accelerating frames requires a curved spacetime, via general relativity, with a different metric.As for what philosophers accept... honestly, who gives a flying fuck what philosophers think of time? The physics part is demonstrably more valid, and has been for a century at this point. A philosopher's pre-relativistic, pre-quantum view of time is as relevant as the humors theory of medicine. McTaggart had the excuse of writing in 1908, but the idea that modern physics treats time as an "illusion" is absurd. Time is in the equations, to which experiments adhere to a dozen decimal places; whether that's "real" or an "illusion" is a matter of semantics, not science. The human conception of time might be an "illusion", as a function of humans perceiving things... but that's a matter of neurology, not physics. And if the philosophers are as outdated about their neurology as they are about physics, their opinions remain equally worthless.
