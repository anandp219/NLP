 Theoretical resolution of small objects is determined by Abbe diffraction limit. Basically, if a half-wavelength of light can't fit between two objects, you can't tell that they are separate. You won't be able to distinguish the peak of the wave from one from the peak of the wave from another; there is too much overlap.Actual eyesight is never limited by that. Actual eyesight is limited by the quality of the lens in your eye, how precisely you can focus it, and how close you can bring it to the lens while remaining in focus. That's well above the Abbe limit, in the range of about .1 millimeters (100,000 nanometers). The Abbe limit comes into play for microscopes, which can be bigger and better controlled than your eye; their limit is closer to 500 nanometers. Various techniques can be used to beat the Abbe limit with machinery, physics, and chemistry, but your eye will never come anywhere close.
