 No.Ya know the rule about when you hear hooves, you think horses, not zebras? Well, in this case, you also don't think about "unknown insect species that make a sound like a horse's hoof when it's crunched by a colobus monkey, which doesn't actually live in this area but might have escaped from a zoo".The thing that jumps out at me is that the dips we see are random. A Dyson sphere wouldn't have randomly-placed holes in it. It would make the thing unstable.There are thousands of other more likely hypotheses. As Phil Plait puts it, investigating the idea is also pretty cheap, so we might as well do it. It was work we were going to be doing anyway in trying to figure out what actually is going on. Yet another case of very poor science journalism.
