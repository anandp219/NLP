 A dam is anchored to the earth on both sides. It is not a freestanding wall. Any force on the dam is transferred to the earth itself. To tip over a dam, you'd have to rip it out of the earth."Ansel Adams - National Archives 79-AAB-01" by Ansel Adams - U.S. National Archives and Records Administration Still Picture Records Section, Special Media Archives Services Division (NWCS-S), National Archives at College Park, MarylandThe sides aren't just there to prevent the water from flowing around it. The dam is actually physically anchored to the walls on both sides.Also, a dam is generally wider at the base than at the top, like this levee:"River Levee Cross Section Figure".

Even if the dam weren't anchored to the earth, it would be hard to tip over because the angle of the force drives it down into the earth, which has been compacted to resist pressure.
