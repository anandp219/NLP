 None whatsoever.If I had to fabricate something, I'd mention the The Earl of Essex Rebellion, which tried to use one of Shakespeare's plays (Richard II) to (somehow) foment a rebellion. The rebellion failed so miserably that it's hard to imagine what the hell they were thinking. But (a) Shakespeare was not involved in the plot, (b) even if he were, it's a completely different plot from the Gunpowder Plot.The Gunpowder Plot was led by Catholics, and Shakespeare's father was Catholic. Some say Shakespeare was himself, in fact. But there's no connection between Shakespeare and any of the plotters, and in fact the rebellion didn't really have much to do with Catholicism. It was really about the interminable struggles between the various powers in Europe; Catholicism was really just a marker for siding with the King of Spain.
