 Given the wide error bars on what we've got, I'd say it doesn't actually so much "change" as "refine" what we already knew."Spreading homo sapiens la" by NordNordWest - File:Spreading homo sapiens ru.svg by Urutseg. Licensed under Public Domain via Commons - File:Spreading homo sapiens la.svgThe basic Out Of Africa hypothesis calls for humans leaving Africa circa 100,000 years ago, so unless the very oldest end of the range turns out to be correct (120 kya), this doesn't alter the basic timing. It pushes back the arrival in Asia from 30,000 years after leaving Africa to 20,000 years. That's a migration speed of about 1/3 kilometer per year, well within the bounds of believability.It does, as the article says, further bolster the notion that Neanderthals kept humans out of Europe, since humans migrated to much greater distances before leaving a presence in much closer places of roughly equivalent climate. It also helps clarify the timing by which humans reached Australia as long as 55 kya, which is a much more arduous trip. If they had a solid footing in Asia 10,000 years earlier, that would provide more time to make it all the way to Australia. (They are generally presumed to have departed from somewhere in south Asia.)So it doesn't really change the overall path as push back some of the dates.
