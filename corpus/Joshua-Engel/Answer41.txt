 Ever notice that that those stories about edible ancient honey never come with pictures? That's because there isn't any such thing. Wikipedia spent some time debating the absence of evidence:Talk:Honey/Archive 1However, as the article says, honey is quite stable. Honey is mostly sugar, and sugars are pretty stable. A bowl of plain white sugar will sit there, as long as you keep it away from humidity, pretty much indefinitely. Microbes that come into contact with it have the moisture sucked out of them by osmosis. If it's got access to oxygen and is above absolute zero it's going to gradually oxidize; I don't know how long it will take but "a million years" isn't entirely unreasonable as a guess. It won't spoil, just vaporize. Honey is sugar (fructose) plus some water. It would spoil, but it has other things that actually do combat spoilage. If honey gets dehydrated, it will be as stable as table sugar. So it's not impossible for there to be jars of crystallized honey sitting in a nice, dry Egyptian tomb somewhere, but they won't be "honey". It's going to be a residue. If it didn't dehydrate, it would gradually suck some moisture out of the air and spoil.So it's correct that honey, stored optimally, probably won't spoil, but neither would any other sugar (or, for that matter, most dessicated things). It's slightly interesting that honey in a liquid form is more rot resistant than other sugar-water solutions, for the reasons the article correctly gives. But it's not "eternal" unless given optimal storage, and under optimal storage lots of things can last a really long time. (Hell, you could probably eat some of those mummified animals as jerky, if you wanted. People actually did consume "mummy dust", though thankfully most of it was fake.)
