 A lot of the things that people call "preservatives" can't be done with high-pressure processing. It won't prevent bread from going stale, for example. It can't preserve colors that fade. It can't prevent oxidation.HPP is good for an interesting array of application, but trying to convert the entire Dannon or Ocean Spray or Sara Lee product line to these would take a massive investment in very expensive equipment. These are commodity producers, with relatively thin profit margins, and whose customers are generally shopping with price in mind.The process has only been widely available for a few years, because it takes extremely high pressure to work. Right now HPP is used primarily for boutique brands, who can build a premium into the product to cover the higher startup cost of processing. It's also used on already-expensive items like seafood.If consumers decide they like brands labeled "preservative-free" enough, the major players will probably introduce it in a few of their premium lines, then migrate it down. But massive shifts don't happen quickly.
