 Most of them. Unless you're doing something that specifically involves calculus, like scientific programming or some kinds of computer graphics, calculus will probably never come up.But calculus is going to be required for practically every computer science program, because that's "college level math". The basic level of required calculus should not be difficult for anybody with the kind of rigorous, mathematical thinking required for computer science. It's also a prerequisite for basic college-level science classes like physics and chemistry. So you're not taking calculus as part of CS. You're taking calculus as part of a general STEM-oriented general requirement for a Bachelor of Science degree. You may discover it as part of an interest in scientific programming or graphics or something else that requires calculus; that's why the overall breadth requirements are there.
