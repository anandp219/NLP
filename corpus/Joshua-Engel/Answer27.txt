 Suppose you have 100 units of energy, and 10 particles in your system.There are only a very small number of ways for one of those 10 particles to have 100 units of energy; that number is ten). Similarly, there are not many ways for one to have 90 and each of the others to have 1 (again, 10).However, there are lots of ways for each of them to have nearly 10 each:(11,9,11,9,11,9,11,9,11,9)(10,10,10,10,10,10,11,9)(12,8,10,10,10,10,11,9)etc etc etc. Combinatorically, the numbers go up very, very, very fast when you try to distribute the numbers evenly. Just for the state of 11s and 9s I listed first there are [math]\frac {10!} {5! 5!} = 252[/math] , and that's before I got into all of the others.So of all the states that the system could be in, the overwhelming majority of them have the energy distributed nearly evenly, which means it will be low. That's what it means for objects to have a tendency to be in a low energy state. Note that it's really a bulk property of objects; it doesn't really have a meaning for a single particle by itself.
