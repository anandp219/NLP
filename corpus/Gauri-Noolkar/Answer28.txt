 Ideally, any country that is approached by refugees should try its level best to take them in. I do not know if Syrian refugees are approaching China (please let me know if and how you have come across any such information). I have doubts though, whether China would be a good place for refugee rehabilitation. The country is already over-populated, its resources are stressed beyond measure - I read somewhere that 80% of its cities are already water stressed, and it is already suffering from unrest, especially in its western Xinjiang province. China is also not a free, democratic country, and running from a Syrian dictatorship into a Chinese dictatorship is like, well... more or less the same thing.Also, China is not particularly known for being inclusive of diverse cultures, which can be seen from its own history; how it systematically 'blended in' all the diverse cultures, languages, communities etc. into one identity. Muslims in Xinjiang province are clearly not comfortable as a minority group. This can be reason enough for Syrian refugees to avoid opting for China, where the chances of preserving and practising their own culture are pretty bleak, as their host country. If you are forced to abandon every bit of your motherland, perhaps forever, you would want to go to a place which gives you more freedom and space, and a better life wouldn't you? China wouldn't be a choice then.
