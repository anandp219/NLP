 I am afraid Pune is not a very touristy city, but you will certainly have a good time here.You should definitely check out the Kelkar Museum, Shaniwar Wada, Camp, Sarasbaug, the University campus, and the old city, notably Tulshibaug if you like shopping as well. A walk down JM road and FC road will be great as well. If you like to party, Koregaon Park is the place.Staying at and around Deccan would help you. It is close to the centre of the city and is well connected to other areas. Safe as well. And you can have some irani chai and bun maska at Goodluck Cafe, which has been catering to Pune's tastebuds since 1935. There are a lot of forts around Pune, so trekking is a big thing here. Sinhagad is a very popular destination. There are many trekking groups in Pune, and most of them are decent to go with. I recently met a wonderful one, and if you wish to learn more from/about them, PM me.I hope this helps.
