 One of the most basic reason why the Indian population shot up post 1921 is improved and accessible health care. Let's face it, India never had a birth rate crunch. What better health care did was bring down the death rate, which meant people lived longer, but which did not necessarily mean rigorous family planning.(The difference between the death rate and the birth rate caused population explosion and it was only post 1990s that our birth rate fell enough for us to enter the third demographic phase where both death rate as well as birth rate fall and the population moves towards stability.) Other major reasons were industrialisation (which meant more jobs and better income), the Green revolution (food security), and government support and security during famines and other natural disasters, education about cleanliness, hygiene and health. I am afraid I do not know enough to comment on the weather conditions part.
