 Firstly, I am a bit sceptical about using characters from the Mahabharata for discussing Good/Bad/Evil, largely because it is extremely difficult to classify them into any one category. They all have their share of virtues and vices, and thus any black and white inferences/conclusions would be not only woefully adequate but also rather unhelpful and even misleading.Bringing the question in a general perspective - yes, being bad and evil can have certain benefits in the short term. "Bad" and "evil" are rather vague terms and can encompass a lot of actions, but I will limit my interpretation to causing harm, direct or indirect, mental or physical or otherwise, to another being out of purely non-defense and selfish motives for the sake of simplicity in this answer.Being bad/evil to achieve one's goals is nothing new, and that is precisely because it is a time-tested technique. It takes people aback, weakens/destroys them and whatever hurdles they place in your way, and makes it considerably easier to achieve goals in the present, and thanks to the consequent reputation, in the future as well. It makes it easier for you to aspire for more, to achieve more, and to keep going, because you have little to no issues about how much you are stepping on, on the way. The chances that you become more of a result-oriented person rather than a process-oriented person increase if you are bad, evil, and ruthless, and you are a great addition to anyone with ambition, and the same moral compass as you.Of course, all this glory lasts for a short while, because these qualities are neither lauded nor upheld in society, and you risk drawing ire, hatred, punishment and even threat to your well being from most people around you. It has a huge degrading effect on you as a person, and if you believe in the karma theory, then boy, you are screwed.Yet, as just one of the species and a part of this ecosystem, is it really extraordinarily wrong to act in purely in one's selfish interests? Is it really going to have the repercussions we imagine when we name those actions as 'sins'? These are points to ponder upon.
