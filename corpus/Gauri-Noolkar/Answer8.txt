 To help people, to show others they are smart, and a lot more. A lot of people write because they genuinely want to share. Each of us is a bundle of unique experiences, full of stories, and has something or the other to offer. Many of us like to. Just as we can express opinions, offer a piece or two of advice and narrate stories to people around us, we can also write it all.Many write because they are asked to, as well. People don't just like to express, they like to, need to, wish to learn as well. We go seeking lessons, solutions, entertainment, solace, controversy, affirmation, debate and drama in real life, as well as on Quora. Those who write are simply responding to our search.Some write because they enjoy the sheer act of writing; some write because that is the way they can express themselves best; some write to impress; some write (especially on specific topics) to stay in touch with their interests; some write to improve their language and writing skills.
