 That's his opinion and he is entitled to it. He represents that section of his generation which sincerely believes that the Indian society is to follow a particular version of "Indian culture" which is bound by specific, collective values, which has been followed for a few centuries now. Note, these values do not include individualism and freedom and equal treatment to women. Also, this version of culture has a history and a set of reasons which neither he nor his counterparts are fully aware of.It is also the reflection of a mindset which is slow to change and accept - do not be fooled by their comfort levels with education ("oh, but they are all so educated!") and technology; fundamental changes in one's lookout towards people, freedoms, responsibilities and life concepts are more influenced by experiences, time and wisdom than formal education and technological access. He said what appeals to him, what he has grown up believing, and what he (apparently) lives by. That is his principle, and it reflects his genuine faith in a particular lifestyle which he believes is for the greater good as well.It is his opinion, and he has every right to express it without fear or constraint. It is his life and he has every right to live it the way he wants.AND SO DO I.
