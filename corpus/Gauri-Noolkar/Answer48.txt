 Full time travelling for the sake of travelling isn't a very lucrative job when it comes to wealth and/or power, so if you have thought that through and still want to go ahead, following are the things you can do -1. Join a tours and travels company as a travel guide.You can join commercial companies and work as a travel guide, taking groups and/or individual customers with you to various places and countries. The only caveat here is that you risk repeating the destinations till they get overly familiar and boring.2. Join an airline, or the railways.I don't know what it takes to get there, but perhaps a course in aviation management? You can steer yourself towards being placed on the plane rather than at the airport.Also, you can join the railways. Hop in as a TC, or railroad engineer.3. Or become a pilot or a train operator.Some hard work and you can actually drive yourself to places.4. The Anthony Bourdain way.If you love travelling, you have surely heard of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. Again, I don't know what it takes, but you can surely earn by travelling and presenting new, offbeat places, or offbeat aspects of regular places to thousands of TV viewers every week. Bonus if you are a foodie as well.
