 I must have been about 3 - I guess, because it is a really, really early memory.I was born in Pune in a hospital opposite Sarasbaug, a very famous Ganesh temple. Yet, as I grew up in the area, my favourite place would be the smaller, less noticeable Shiva Temple in the vicinity. The main reason for that was the prajakta tree, which had beautiful, fragrant flowers like these - Every morning, my grandmother used to dress me up (usually in cotton frocks), and my grandfather would take me to the Shiva Temple before he went to work.There, he would give me his handkerchief, and I used to collect all the flowers which would have fallen down from the tree that morning. He always told me that flowers should not be plucked, but taken only when they would fall down from the tree. ...these I picked.and then we would walk home.That's it, simply joy :)I vaguely recollect mentioning this memory earlier on Quora, but I never tire of it. :)
