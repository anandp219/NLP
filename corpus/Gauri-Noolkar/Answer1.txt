 Not exactly ancient history, but one decent movie about a period in India before the British is Jodhaa Akbar by Ashutosh Gowarikar.It is an out-and-out commercial movie, but manages to retain decency and sense, without any of the loudness and flamboyance most of the commercial blockbuster hits rely on. I do not know how historically accurate the story is, but it is acceptable, and quite engaging.The sets and actors brim and overflow with beauty, and the music is simply superb. Ashutosh Gowarikar manages to tone down Hrithik Roshan's hyper acting to the level that his face now permanently represents a young Akbar to everyone who has watched this film - just as Prithviraj Kapoor personifies an old Akbar for everyone who has watched Mughal-e-Azam. Aishwarya Rai looks pretty as usual, and her toned down, non-plastic-y version is refreshing as well. Other actors do justice to their roles, too.The movie is slightly long (but then, we are talking Ashutosh Gowarikar...) but it does not bore or make you glance into your watch. A simple, decent, tastefully made period film - boy, we do need more of those.Are you looking forward to watching Bajirao Mastani, by the way? It releases on 18th December.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...My most favourite hero ever!I can't wait!! :)
