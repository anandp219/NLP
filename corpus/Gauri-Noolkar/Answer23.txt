 The problem with "ghar wapsi" is that it is a misfit in the current social mood, orientation and outlook of India. The 'modern' section of the Indian society is increasingly disillusioned with a distorted concept of secularism, often confusing it with bashing/lack of respect for Hinduism with an irrationally soft corner for religions which actually force/induce conversions. This section, though a minority, is also the one which is the most educated, and wielding power over most resources within the country, ensuring that their voices prevail over all. The majority is faceless and cannot do much about it, at least for now.With such a background, a concept which does not "fit in" with the values of this modern section cannot be seen comfortably as making waves. It cannot hope to garner their acceptance, let alone support, and it should very well except scathing criticism from all corners.The problem with ghar wapsi is the whole brouhaha it allows to surround it, while proponents of other, more rigid religions continue their work of systematic conversions with low profile. Supporters of ghar wapsi do not realise that making it an emotional, explosive and widely publicised issue is not going to help in any way. Ghar wapsi has a lot to learn from other organised religions. It clearly isn't. That's what's wrong with it.
