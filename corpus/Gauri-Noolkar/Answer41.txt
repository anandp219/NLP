 To be fair, my husband would do a better job at answering this rather than me. My husband is not as regular on Quora as he should be in order to be called a Quoran (though he has written some very popular answers here). He is really not a "fellow Quoran" for me, because-a) by the time he came on Quora, we had known each other as at least best friends for four years and b) apart from sharing occasional answers, A2As and some comments, Quora has little to no importance in our relationship.In short, the context of Quora doesn't apply in my marriage with Amogh Oak.
