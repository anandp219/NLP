 Is there a war? A race? A match? I don't see how modernisation and Indian culture are at loggerheads. In fact, if anything else, Indian culture is flexible enough to take modernisation in its stride, and it has been doing so, slowly, steadily, a bit haphazardly and illogically, but certainly. Indian culture is based on philosophies and spiritual/religious values which are flexible, and which can run as undercurrents through history and future as society changes and moulds itself. This is because these philosophies and values do not engage primarily with daily life - they deal with the fundamentalism of our existence, our purpose, our conscience and our actions. They do not provide a "DOs and DON'Ts" list; they do not tell us to fear some entity. They address concepts which can be fit, debated and investigated in a universal context. Whatever happens on the surface does not contest their position.
