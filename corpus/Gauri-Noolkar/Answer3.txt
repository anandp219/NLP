 The average Indian knows very little about Iran, and apart from "Muslim country", "conservative towards women", and "America-hater", it doesn't register much on his/her consciousness.Those who know a bit of history (and they are many), and that ancient Iran was known as Persia, associate Iran with having close ties with our own history. Cultural, culinary, linguistic and religious exchanges are quite widely acknowledged. Iran, then, is also associated with beautiful art and poetry, story-telling (some of the Arabian Nights tales, for example), kings and invasions, and of course, beautiful women.We also associate Iran with a minority community largely concentrated on the western coast of India (Gujarat and Maharashtra) - the Parsees. Not much is known about them to the rest of the country - except that they are peace-loving, industrious, and completely blended into the Indian fabric. The Tatas are the most famous Parsees among the masses.Those who read, and have read "Not Without My Daughter" more often than not find Iran conservative, regressive and a place "to avoid". In general, non-Muslim Indians feel a mixture of wariness and interest in Iran - they are interested to hear about it, but would hesitate to go there even temporarily, even if they would get a chance. Consequently, it is not a tourist destination for most of us. The enmity with America, the 'closed' and non-democratic nature of the country (we hardly hear any news from there!), combined with the very popular NWMD, makes Iran look like a nebulous and slightly fearful country, albeit with an awareness that it isn't bad towards India.In short, we know pretty much nothing about modern day Iran - its society, economy, natural beauty, education, trends, customs, and issues. We are not sure of what we know either. Iran, for most ordinary Indians, is an old friend who left town and who we haven't caught up with for a long, long time.
