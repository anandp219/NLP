 The best way to kill loneliness is to be comfortable being with yourself.Sure, you could join groups and activities to meet people, but it gets exhausting after a while, especially if you seem to be the one continually putting in efforts with other people. It is a harsh fact that people are drawn more naturally towards 'people' people, and unless you are an easy extrovert thrown into unfortunate, circumstantial loneliness, you will find it very difficult to draw people towards you. I would still suggest keeping people in the loop, but instead of focusing on them excessively, focus on yourself. Explore your mind, and surprise it regularly with new information, activities and ideas. Keep it busy, challenge it, pamper it, exhaust it. At the same time, give it a break, and the strength to listen to itself - most of us do not really let our thoughts roam our brains loud and clear, because we fear confronting them in totality, and all alone. We are in a denial mode about so many things. The fears, the lies we convince ourselves to believe, the criticism, the awkwardness and awe of some truly beautiful compliments you have ever received - they are all lurking in the corner of our minds which we regularly shut off by engaging it with other people, things and actions. Perhaps you could open that up by doing absolutely nothing with absolutely no one, and then you would not be lonely at all.
