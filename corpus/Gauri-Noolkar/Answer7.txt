 Age 5 - Boy tees and shorts. Stories of demon and a brave boy fighting them and crossing seven seas to save his dog. Mechano and Lego.Age 9 - Perfect at tying pigtails. Lots of books. When hit by a guy, being told, "fight back, because you can."Age 13 - Long drives. Longer conversations. "Intelligence is nothing if you don't work hard." "Who's that guy? Why does he call you? Be careful!"Age 17 - Forehead creases over phone bills. Grins over achievements. Dragged feet during shopping. "What do you plan to do with your life? How can I help?"Age 22 - University admissions. Consequent goodbyes. Skype calls. Birthday emails. Give and take of advice and ideas.Age 24 - "Is he the one?"Being raised by an Indian father is a roller coaster ride. It is to see a perfectly logical, rational man turn into an emotional, irrational being in less than a second. It is to be spoilt by a man who can scare the shit out of you with one raised eyebrow. It is to see a tight-lipped, hard-faced man who did not cry at his father's funeral trying to hold back tears when he says goodbye to you at the airport. It is to see a man who raised you 'like a boy' to suddenly look suspiciously at all boys who might have glanced a second time at 'his girl'. It is to see a man who pushed you to be 'independent' all your life to be extremely unsettled to see your individualistic approach in your adult life, especially in your marriage. It is, in short, to be raised by a bundle of contradictions and explosive emotions, one you never understand, but are attached to, anyway.There is no one way to describe how an Indian father raises his children. He grows and learns and changes with them. His gamut of emotions is manifest in the emotions he evokes in his children, at times reassuring them of certainty, at times confusing them with his own contradictions. He loves, argues, defends and disowns passionately, and it is that passion which is the undercurrent of everything he does for, and expects from his children. Being raised by an Indian father - despite differing values, situations, rewards, punishments and attitudes - is being raised with a passion which evolves with you.
