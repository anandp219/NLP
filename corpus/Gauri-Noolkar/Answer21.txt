 I do not know how cold it gets in Ahmedabad, but yes, Pune has what we call "  ", translated literally as a "rosy winter", which does make you reach out for your shawls and sweaters for a few weeks in the year.Winters in Pune have always been lovely, partly because they are extremely pleasant and partly because the city looks lovely just after the monsoon has rolled out its greenery before its departure. The mornings are misty, and in some parts, you can actually see your breath if you go for an early morning stroll or a jog. It does get hot in the afternoon though, and the evenings are breezy and pleasant. The cold sets in with the night, and you would not mind snuggling in a quilt all night long; it does get that cold.Well, I have been rambling enough, but yes, keep a muffler, gloves, socks and a sweater or two in your wardrobe if you are going to spend a winter in Pune.
