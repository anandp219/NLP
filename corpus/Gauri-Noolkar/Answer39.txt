 A book is but a medium, and it is ultimately the willpower in you which will make you believe in life again. Having said that, the following books have made me believe in different aspects of life, and love and live life to the fullest.1. Rau - this made me believe in love, and in loving unflinchingly, passionately, unconditionally. 2. My Family and Other Animals - this made me believe in the beauty of nature, and the heaven called childhood, the two most amazing things life has to offer.3. Harry Potter - this book taught me the beauty of values, friendships, relationships, learning, and character. It taught me that life is magical, expressive and that it can surprise you. The language and humour are a bonus.4. From Heaven Lake - this book taught me adventure, and the thrill life has to offer from travelling and learning more about its manifestations across the globe. The more we travel, the more we see, and life never stays the same.5. Eka Dishecha Shodh - this told me that my life has potential beyond my well being. It opened doors to new ideas, new awareness, new possibilities, and one of the most vital things life has to offer - the purpose of leaving behind a legacy.
