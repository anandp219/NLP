 Peter Gregory is a caricature of tech billionaires. There's obviously some Peter Thiel in there, but they were aiming for more of a mish-mosh. Below is taken from an interview with Mike Judge from the Financial Times. Judge discusses this issue directly.I tell Judge that I watched Silicon Valley before meeting Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and the first institutional investor in Facebook. Thiel has a distinctive presence  wide-eyed, nervous, with a habit of making outlandish statements whose impact is masked by a halting conversational style.Some of these tics are embodied with uncanny accuracy by the shows fictional billionaire investor Peter Gregory, played by Christopher Evan Welch. Peter Thiel is just one of many tech titans that Chris could have been imitating, says Judge. Its almost that theres a tech accent in the way those guys talk and Chris just nailed it. Sadly, however, the actor died from lung cancer during the shooting of the second season and will only appear in five episodes. Judge calls the death a tragedy but it will be incorporated into the plot. We just looked at it in real life, he says. What would happen if a one-man venture capital fund dies and how would that go down?Interview: Mike Judge - FT.com
