 Pixar movies are usually a must-see for me, and I try to go into them without reading previews, reviews, etc. Going into the movie, all I knew about Inside Out was that it appeared to have "borrowed" the main premise from the '90s sitcom, Herman's Head.Now to be fair, my impressions of the movie were probably soured somewhat by the fact that the guy behind me was snoring so loud I could hear him over the movie speakers, which themselves were cranked up to 11. That aside, I just couldn't get into it. While the CGI was top notch and I'll enjoy anything that Amy Poehler, Bill Hader or Lewis Black does, the story was surprisingly simplistic and very predictable. There were also small details that bugged me. Why were the memories shown in 3rd person? Why did the emotions talk about Rylee as if she were a separate entity? Also, while I appreciate that this movie might get people to start thinking about how we think (introspection and metacognition), I was somewhat dismayed that they chose to perpetuate the myth that memories are like movies that never change, as opposed to the fact that memories are constantly being reconstructed and prone to error. I did have several laugh out loud moments, but mostly walked out pretty down on the movie. I love most things Pixar and it's always a shame to come away disappointed.
