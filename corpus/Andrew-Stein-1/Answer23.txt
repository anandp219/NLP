 I'm not a neuroscientist, but I do visit their blogs. :) Steven Novella, a Harvard Neurologist and host of The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast wrote about the movie on his blog. You can read the full post here, Inside Out - A Neuroscience Metaphor, but I'll post a snippet below.ConclusionI loved the movie. It was very enjoyable, and I highly recommend it. If you have children the movie is especially sweet (which is usually the case with Pixar).As a metaphor for brain function, the movie was highly problematic. Mostly accuracy was sacrificed for the plot and to keep the movie simple and entertaining. However, it is a very interesting thought experiment  how to design a metaphor that accurately captures brain function according to our best current knowledge. I do hope the movie motivates people to think about brain function, but I fear it will increase some poor brain metaphors in the public consciousness.
