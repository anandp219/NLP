 No. There's no denying that his character is a genius and came up with a once-in-a-generation innovation. However being a great coder doesn't necessarily mean he's great at managing other coders or running a business. Laurie's assessment of Richard was pretty spot on. He came up with an amazing technology and then had no idea what to do with it. He was horrible negotiating deals and dealing with other people, in general. You can see clear examples of this when he spoon-fed EndFrame enough details to allow them to reverse-engineer his technology or allowing Homicide's CEO to walk all over him.As a fan, it was a punch in the gut to see the season end like this, but you can't fault Laurie's reasoning.
