 Adding on to my wife, Emily Anderson's answer, cat play is almost entirely based on learning how to hunt and honing their skills. When two cats are playing, they'll take turns being the hunter and the prey. Healthy play should almost look like a wrestling match where they'll go at it for a few seconds, then back away, usually to groom themselves or each other. Below are a few videos of our cats, Squishy and Waffles, playing together.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...You can see them taking turns to pounce on one another and they are not making a sound. A real fight would involve a lot of hissing, yowling and blood.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...In slow motion, you can see how the claws are pretty much staying sheathed and they are not biting down hard.And, for the hell of it, here's what they do after a good session of stalk and pounce. :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
