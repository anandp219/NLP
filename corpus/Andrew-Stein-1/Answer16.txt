 Vito knew that the power of his illicit empire came from personal connections, friendships and relationships with all manner of people, from lowly boarders needing help to pay the rent to judges, senators, congressmen, etc. The novel explores this in more detail. Over the decades, many people came to Vito for advice or help. He helped kids get into college and advised them on careers. Some became judges, politicians, high ranking police officials and more. They never forgot the kindness of their "godfather" and were glad to help him in return. The Jack Woltz plot line, especially in the novel, is used to demonstrate Vito's power compared to Jacks. Woltz talks about how he advised the White House on WW2 propaganda and had a personal relationship with J. Edgar Hoover. He was very showy, very public and very famous (most people only knew Vito as an olive oil businessman, if they even heard of him.) He was a person who was secure in his personal, professional and political power. Finding his horse's head in his bed was shocking to him, not only because of the violation of his home and property, but because Vito was sending a very clear message: Jack Woltz' connections weren't nearly as powerful as Vito's.With that in mind, Vito felt it was too much of a risk to deal in hard drugs like heroin. He knew that even his political connections wouldn't help him when it came to going easy on people arrested for smuggling or dealing drugs. He felt that getting into drugs would risk destroying other parts of his empire. In this, he was probably correct.Vito's biggest mistake was in underestimating the Turk. There hadn't been any problems with other gangsters in a decade and he let his guard down. Tom Hagen, newly installed in his role of Consigliere, while capable, didn't have the experience to detect and protect against physical attacks. They pretty much forgot about the Turk, which is why he was able to pull off the (botched) hit later down the road.
