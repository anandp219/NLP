 I don't see many similarities between the two characters, other than being played by tall, thin, awkward guys. Kenneth was the lowest man on the totem poll, infinitely naive and cheerful, and ignorant of anything that isn't related to TV or pig farming. Jared, on the other hand, has a management position (head of business management) and has a hand in helping make decisions (even if nobody else really respects him). He isn't unaware of his own awkwardness or others feelings about him and his habit of making death threats in German whilst sleeping hints at a much darker side. Kenneth gladly takes crap from everyone because he is so thrilled to be working at NBC that nothing can bring him down. Jared basically deals with the abuse hurled at him by Gilfoyle and Dinesh by trying to brush it aside.Doing a bit of searching, a Buzzfeed article says that the actor, ZachWoods, bases Jared partially on his mom.3. He drew some inspiration for his Silicon Valley character, Jared, from his mom. Woods said, I feel like theres a certain quality that a lot of moms and some dads have too, which is a degree of sacrifice that is kind of outrageous. Like they make sure everyone is taken care of and then they go eat over the sink.[1][1]25 Things You Need To Know About Zach Woods
