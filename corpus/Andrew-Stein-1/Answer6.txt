 As opposed to armor-like hides or razor sharp claws, human beings' evolved to be social animals. Our survival depends on conforming and cooperating with group(s) in order to do things like split up labor into smaller tasks, taking down larger animals, etc. For the vast majority of our existence, an individual's survival depended on being part of a group, pack, tribe, etc. Exile and isolation lead to death. Thus, we evolved instincts and behaviors that let us conform to groups in order to keep from disrupting cohesion in the group. For example, our brains evolved to make use of Heuristics in judgment and decision-making. These are essentially shortcuts that allow us to make quick (if sometimes inaccurate decisions.) These can take the form of Cognitive biases, many of which are geared toward making decisions that conform to pleasing your group. One of the more well-known examples of this is Groupthink. In order to maintain cohesion, group members tend to strive toward consensus, even if the consensus is "wrong." Groupthink is driven by our instinctual need to be seen as a positive member of the group to avoid being cast out. We evolved to prefer the safety of cohesion, even at the cost of accuracy or being factually correct. It was a strategy that served us well as hunter-gatherers, but not so much as office drones in the 21st century. Ethics are defined by the groups you are a member of: your family, peer group, friends, schoolmates, etc. Since we also want to make sure our gene pool survives, we have to make sure our kids conform to group norms as well. Thus we teach our children language, ethics, morals, etc to our kids to make sure they have the best chance of keeping with the pack and avoiding exile.
