 Jared - You may have to work pretty hard. But, it'll free us from this lawsuit.Gilfoyle - Are you saying, "work will set you free?"Jared - Yes! They have the manpower. We have the perseverance. Triumph of the will!...Dinesh - He's the most cheerful person I ever heard quote Hitler.Jared is referencing the 1935 Leni Riefenstahl propaganda film, Triumph of the Will. Furthermore, the idea that work will set you free references the phrase Arbeit macht frei. Quoting the wiki article:"Arbeit macht frei" (German pronunciation: [abat maxt fa]) is a German phrase meaning "work makes (you) free."[1] The slogan was placed over the entrances to a number of Nazi concentration camps during World War II, including Auschwitz I, where it was made by prisoners with metalwork skills and erected by order of the Nazis in June 1940.
