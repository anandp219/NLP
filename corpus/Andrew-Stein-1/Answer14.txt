 Seconding Emily Anderson's answer on UNIQLO. They have relatively high quality clothes at great prices. There are several locations in Manhattan and most malls in the surrounding area have a store now too. Winter weather in NYC usually means 20s-30s with all sorts of delightful combinations of rain, sleet, ice and snow. Make sure you have coats and shoes that are waterproof. That being said, the winters here aren't that bad, especially compared to places like Chicago or Minneapolis. You can expect to be cold and wet, but not depressingly so. :)
