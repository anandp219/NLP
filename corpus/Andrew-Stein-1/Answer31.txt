 When Richard worked at Hooli, his contract contained language that any work done using Hooli equipment would therefore become Hooli's property. Therefore, once Richard used a computer at Hooli to work on his app, it became the property of Hooli.However, his contract, along with many other Hooli employees, also included a Non-compete clause that prohibited him from securing employment elsewhere. (Jared had this same clause too.) However, non-compete clauses were deemed unlawful by the state Supreme Court. Any Hooli employee whose contract included this clause was null and void, therefore, the language pertaining to IP developed on Hooli's equipment (along with everything else in his contract) is moot and unenforceable.It wasn't the fact that Richard hired Jared from Hooli that ended up being Belson's undoing. Belson included the non-compete violation charge to the arbitration just to be a dick. Had he not done so, the arbitrator may never have noticed this clause and would have ruled in Hooli's favor.
