 You may need someone to help you with this, but one idea is to try to implement some form of temptation bundling. This is the idea of tying a pleasurable activity together with a an activity you are prone to avoid. The catch is that you only let yourself enjoy the fun activity when you are doing the not-so-fun one. For example, let's say you are a huge Game of Thrones fan. Make a rule that you can only watch the show when you are on the treadmill. (This is where it helps to have a second person to enforce the rule.) Hopefully, the desire to watch the show (or listen to a podcast, audiobook, etc) will provide enough motivation to make you want to exercise.For more information:The Freakonomics podcast did an episode on this earlier this year: When Willpower Isnt Enough: A New Freakonomics Radio PodcastToo Lazy To Work Out?
