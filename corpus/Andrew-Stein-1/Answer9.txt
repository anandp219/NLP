 Laszlo Bock, Google's VP of People Operations (read: HR) wrote a book[1] that covers how Google has identified and dealt with Heuristics in judgment and decision-making like Cognitive bias. In a nutshell, they've completely changed how HR works in order to minimize biases such as the one in your question. He also wrote an article on Wired (in promotion of his book) that talks about these things. From Heres Googles Secret to Hiring the Best PeopleYOU NEVER GET a second chance to make a first impression was the tagline for a Head & Shoulders shampoo ad campaign in the 1980s. It unfortunately encapsulates how most interviews work. There have been volumes written about how the first five minutes of an interview are what really matter, describing how interviewers make initial assessments and spend the rest of the interview working to confirm those assessments. If they like you, they look for reasons to like you more. If they dont like your handshake or the awkward introduction, then the interview is essentially over because they spend the rest of the meeting looking for reasons to reject you. These small moments of observation that are then used to make bigger decisions are called thin slices.Tricia Prickett and Neha Gada-Jain, two psychology students at the University of Toledo, collaborated with their professor Frank Bernieri and reported in a 2000 study that judgments made in the first 10 seconds of an interview could predict the outcome of the interview.So one of the things that Google changed is to take away the decision on whether to hire from the interviewer. He or she takes notes and passes it on to another group who will make the decision.[2]With that in mind, one thing to do is to take notes on prospective targets and leaving out all personal information (name, sex, age, race) and have some other people review them and give you their opinions.*Work Rules! *How we hire - Google Careers
