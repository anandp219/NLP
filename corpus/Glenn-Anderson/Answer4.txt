 Wow. No, you are not retarded. A great many highly intelligent people believe in a god. These kids are bullies, and should be handled as such. For yourself, don't let bullying effect your faith. Now, I'm an atheist myself, so, I understand that bullying is the absolute worst way to try to change a person's mind. Theists try stuff like this all the time. You have my sympathy. That's not to say that challenging your faith is not a bad thing. Many believe this just makes it stronger. For some of us, it led to disbelief. But if you choose to do so, do it on your own terms. But I want to know, here do you live that nonbelievers outnumber believers, anyway?
