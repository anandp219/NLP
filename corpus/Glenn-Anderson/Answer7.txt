 Yes, evolution does have a major axis of change. It's called time. And like all things with a time axis, it always moves forward into the future. By this common yard stick, all life has evolved to the same degree.One thing to remember is that life necessarily started simple. So, it's easy to look back and say, hmm, life becomes more complex over time. But that's just because there wasn't really any other place to go. And because of our peculiar biases we tend to see the more complex life more readily than the simpler life that vastly outweighs all complex life. Lets face it, a forest is much more interesting to us humans than our Gut flora.
