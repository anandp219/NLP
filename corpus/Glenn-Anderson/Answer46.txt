 Selective pressure is those parts of the environment that are favoring certain sorts of adaptation. For instance, a change in weather to a more snowy landscape would put pressure on coat coloring to favor lighter shades. Of course selective pressure can be less obvious, like the pressure the immune system is always under to adapt to new diseases.In general it appears that most variation in a population is more or less random, with genetic drift playing a pretty strong role. However, when a population is put under these conditions, natural selection plays its part too.
