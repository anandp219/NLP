 Here's the thing. jQuery is more or less the de facto method for accessing and manipulating the DOM. There are other libraries I've used that I prefer, but you just cannot escape jQuery. Looking for a premade widget so you need not roll your own. Chances are, you'll find one in jQuery. Getting involved in an already established code base, nine out of ten times, it's already using jQuery.jQuery is an effective library. It does a lot of useful things, and does them well.So yes, a new web developer should learn jQuery as part of learning JavaScript. It's an essential skill that will at some point become a requirement.
