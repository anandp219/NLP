 First, build a time machine and travel back to the late 50's through early 70's. Opportunities should be plentiful. Of course, the amenities will be unbearable. Do you like punch cards?But more seriously, COBOL is a dying technology. Some wold say dead, but it doesn't yet know it. You may find some temporary work helping to prop up old legacy systems. It might even pay well due to scarcity. But I'd not build a career on it. It would soon become a chore. There is nothing exciting or interesting about these systems.The best you could hope for is a job replacing legacy COBOL systems with something new and shiny. That might be fun. But probably not.
