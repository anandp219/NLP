 Well, here's the thing. Life on earth started pretty soon after the planet had cooled down. Based on this, I tend to think life forms pretty readily. However, it took about three billion years before we reached complex, multi-cellular life. Maybe this is less common. Maybe many planets don't get beyond this stage. But assuming they do, I'm going to disagree with some others.I think like life elsewhere would be recognizable. I've given examples of convergent evolution in another question: Glenn Anderson's answer to How come we do not see evolution repeat itself to some extent as statistically expected?Here's an example of convergent evolution in three different lineages. A shark (a cartilagenous fish), a dolphin (a mammal), and an Ichthyosaur (a marine reptile).The details of these are significantly different, but superficially they have arrived at very similar body plans.I think that there are naturally certain niches that will arise, and that there are certain body plans that will be efficient in these niches, and are likely to be hit on, even in a world where life has developed very differently from our own.
