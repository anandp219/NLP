 When I was about sixteen, for Christmas, a friend of mine got an Atari 400. This was about 1980. Neither of us knew anything about computers, but it came with a BASIC cartridge and some instructions, and we decided to see what it could do.I don't remember but I'm sure we did that standard first program:10 PRINT "HELLO"20 GOTO 10But we decided to try something more ambitious and went with a Dungeons & Dragons character generator. It started pretty simple, and we kept adding to it as we went along. We worked on it for weeks. It was glorious. Looking back now, with nearly 30 years of professional experience, I can honestly say it was horrendous. But gloriously so. Since that day, I have been hooked.
