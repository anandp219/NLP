 Java is a statically typed, compiled language. The JVM can do a lot more optimization because of this. Javascript is a lot looser. The V8 engine does a pretty good job with its JIT compilation, but there is only so much you can do with the dynamic nature of JavaScript. You can't even count on a single object instance being the same size, with the same members with the same type. So, rather than knowing the location of a class member by byte offset, in JavaScript you'll have to use a hashing method. JavaScript is pretty cool, but this flexibility does have a cost.
