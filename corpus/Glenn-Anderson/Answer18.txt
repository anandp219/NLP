 Well, with those criteria, there is only one language choice: JavaScript. This is an absolute necessity if you're going to do any work on the web. And fortunately, it is an option on many of that other stuff.Of course, the real choice will be decided by an actual project. For instance, if you're working on any sort of enterprise system that has been around for any length of time, and you're not doing any frontend work, you may end up having to use Java.You really can't pick one language and hope it fits all niches and opportunities. If you're looking for a language to sink your teeth into and start learning, then I've heard Python is good. I'm just not sure how far it will take you professionally. JavaScript is pretty easy to learn, but it is also easy to pick up bad habits.If you're looking to take advantage of current opportunities, then we're back to JavaScript which is really hot right now. So, the end result? It really depends on your goals. If you just want to learn, maybe stick with Python. If you want to do cool stuff, or work on the web, or take advantage of current market trends, then JavaScript may be the way to go.Just don't do PHP. Starting your career with PHP is like starting to smoke when you're in your 20's.
