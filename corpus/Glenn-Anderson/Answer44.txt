 Might as well go with a classic: Peppered mothThis coloring of this moth has varied over time due to pollution. The coloration of the peppered moth before the industrial revolution was light, to better match the background color of the trees that they rested on.However, the trees became darkened with soot during the Industrial revolution, which favored moths with a darker coloration.And now that pollution isn't the large problem it once was, the moths are tending towards a light er colorization again.The peppered moth is pretty much the poster kid of natural selection, since the changes in coloration have been so well documented over the past couple of hundred years.To quote the Wikipedia entry above:The first carbonaria morph was recorded by Edleston in Manchester in 1848, and over the subsequent years it increased in frequency. Predation experiments, particularly by Bernard Kettlewell, established that the agent of selection was birds who preyed on the carbonaria morph.
