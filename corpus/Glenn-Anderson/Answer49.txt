 complete lack of fossil records (supposedly ape to human fossils are proof. These have all been debunked. I'm not sure where you got this debunked idea, but you're simply wrong. I also suspect you are seriously underestimating the number of fossil hominids there are. You also appear to not understand that evolution is not linear, it is bushy. Here is an example of a possible cladogram of humans most recent ancestors: Not exactly linear. And that is not a complete catalog of fossil species and many of these have multiple fossil instances.With that said, many clear trends can be found when looking at our ancestry. For example this image:29+ Evidences for MacroevolutionThis image doesn't represent a linear evolution, but it does show the development of derived human like features from something more basal.But here's something else to think about- where are the fossils that show what a pig evolved from, or a bear, what about a dolphin- an air breathing mammal that lives in the water, how did this evolve over millions of years, one gene mutation at a time, and from what? What about the apes we supposedly came from? Bears and dogs are pretty closely related. In fact, close to the base of their family tree there is a species called, wait for it, Bear dog.The Evolution of cetaceans, like dolphins, actually has a pretty good record. Perhaps most interesting is Ambulocetus natans. This is an early cetacean that was well adapted for life both in and out of the water.Why are no fossils found for the failed mutations of the animals we now see today? Because there would not be very many of those around. Fossilization is a pretty rare occurrence. Not to mention that "failure" doesn't fossilize well. The staggering amount of assertions by supposed experts they simply dream up to explain things without evidence, or being questioned? Evolution is one of the best theories science has going. It explains a wide diversity of otherwise seemingly unrelated data, and it makes specific, risky, testable predictions that never fail to confirm under a growing mountain of evidence. Scientists so roundly accept it because it appears to be true. What do you think makes more sense, that all these experts with decades of education and research experience are wrong and you are right. Or that they may know somethings that you do not?These severe flaws. Why are these blindly skimmed over or simply omitted altogether?Because, these flaws are nonexistent. They are the product of religious leaders who have a vested, emotional interest in this particular science being wrong.I'm not attempting to troll here, I'm legitimately asking why this has been so widely taught despite very obvious and serious problems behind the smoke and mirrors. Am I missing something or is the educational system really that poor?I'm glad you are not trolling. The problem is not with education and evolution, the problem is with your understanding. But that problem can be fixed.
