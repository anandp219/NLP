 If you go out with your eyes closed, no matter how bright the sun shines, you would still see darkness. For Parshuram's case, his divine eyes were obfuscated by anger.Lord Parshuram had earlier given Shiva's bow to king Janak and had instructed him to keep it safe. When Lord Ram broke it, Parshuram was immediately filled with anger and came to the king's palace to punish the "culprit". But when Lord Ram paid him obeisance and calmly requested him to give appropriate punishment, his anger subsided and he recognized the other divine.So never let yourself be blinded by anger - as it can cause you more harm than to others.
