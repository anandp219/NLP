I forgot the books!Professor: Couldn't you have said the easy term straightaway?!- Bollywood movie 3 IdiotsThe above dialog beautifully captures the essence of my answer. If you today Hinduism topic to be called Sanatan Dharma, or start calling Krishna and Rama as bhrahman, majority of the people won't be able to even read it, forget about the understanding. If you talk about Hindu/Indian mythology in East or West, people directly associate these with Ramayana, Mahabharata etc. And so is vice versa. If you are giving a lecture to a targeted audience, then perhaps it is fine to refer Hindu/Indian mythology as Purana, but in order for the masses to understand on Quora, I don't prefer being too technical.For those people who prefer Purana to "mythology" because the latter gives a false impression of "myths", let me tell you that a lot of people believe Bhagavad Gita is real and given its association with Mahabharata and "mythology", there is already a conception that Hindu mythology is not truly a "mythology". And those who think that all these stories are unreal - well, you are already happy with the topic!On Quora, lets concentrate on explaining our mythology, its essence and significance, and making them simpler to understand. Its already too much convoluted. Let's remove some layers rather than creating a new one.
