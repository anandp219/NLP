 Let me tell you a universal, truthful fact:"God exists. Krishna was the incarnation of God himself."If I just wrote the above lines, immediately a lot of Quorans would flood the comments section. Comments would range from "Indeed, hail Lord Krishna!" to "I do not want to burst your bubble, but I wonder what more stupidity can I expect from you. Stop spreading rumors....Science says...what is the proof...." and so on.And that's the point. After reading the above "fact", do you now "know" it? No. Texts and words turn into knowledge when you accept these. Knowing and accepting are two different things.Kauravas were told by a lot of people, including their gurus, but they never accepted it. And people like Bhishma, who accepted it, were just following their dharma by fighting from the side of Kauravas. So none of them had any reason to fear Krishna.
