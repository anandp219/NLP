 All of the following things I already knew, but Quora helped me actually implement these in my life, and therefore it has been my honorable guru.Act, not react: Sometimes I get very hateful and mocking comments. In the beginning, I used to get angry and enter into never-ending tug-of-war, but slowly by practicing Be Nice Be Respectful policy, I learnt how to control my anger, subdue my temptation to to reply instantly and be respectful. Importance of patience and persistence: Quora algorithms test your patience. I didn't write for couple of month due to personal reasons. When I came back, I found it very difficult to get views for the answers. But then nothing is achieved without persistence, so I motivated myself to keep on writing hoping that these algorithms would "learn" as time passes, and they did.How to organize my thoughts: I spend a large amount of time thinking about an answer, even if it is small. This has helped me to reduce noise in my thinking and focus on the essence of the question in hand.Startups need not do different things, but do things differently: I had never imagined a better platform than Wikipedia for knowledge, but then came Quora. They added a human element to it. People started explaining complex phenomenon in layman terms, I got to know and interact with like-minded people and so on.Do karma without worrying about the results: I read this quote in Bhagavad Gita, but Quora helped me apply this in everyday life. In the beginning, I was very obsessed with upvotes and used to feel bad when got only a few. But then slowly I realized that the only thing I controlled was writing here, and that I should write good answers so that people can derive some knowledge from these - anytime in future. In the end, what matters is the footprints you leave in the sands of time.
