 Gita doesn't contain how do fusion and fission work, but it does tell the person to use these to address world's energy issues rather than destructing it with weapons.It doesn't tell you how to learn calculus for your exam, but it does tell you to prepare with full dedication and hardwork, thinking how you would use your future career to do good for the society, without worrying or fearing about the outcome.It doesn't tell you how to play guitar, but it does tell you to use it to create harmony in the world and get lost in the divine with full devotion.It doesn't tell you whether you should read Harry Potter or A Brief History of Time, but it does tell you to derive knowledge of oneness and equality of all beings to enjoy eternal bliss.Human knowledge is ever increasing - there are new questions, answers and discoveries everyday. It evolves according to the needs of the hour, discarding the old and replacing it with new - just as you replace your clothes with new design, fashion and age. But there is certain aspect of life, far away from the grasp of our hands and eyes, beyond the logical intellect, which is eternal, which specifies how to use the new knowledge, what purpose it should have, how inner self needs to be kept pure in the wake of unintentional consequences and so on. This knowledge contains the fundamental laws of life, the underlying principles needed to sustain the humanity as it should be - loving, progressing and happy. It is this piece of knowledge which Gita contains.So Gita does not have all human knowledge, but it has that part of knowledge, which is the essence, the foundation, the base from which all other types of knowledge derive their benefits, meaning and purposes.
