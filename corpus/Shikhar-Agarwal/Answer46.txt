 I am sure you have heard several stories about students leaving CS in non-IIT institutes to join any department in IIT. You might have heard your mother telling you how smart Sharma uncle's son is just because he is an IITian. You might also have seen many students showing off their IIT T-shirts. So yes, students, in fact the society in general, see IIT as a brand. But let's say in future, some college Indian Institute of Better Technology (IIBT) is established that is better than IITs, would you still be that crazy about IITs? Obviously not. So the point is the brand is because of the institution, and not vice versa. These two are like different faces of the same coin, and therefore when you talk about IIT as a brand, it encapsulates the institution within it.They say, "what's in a name?", but the truth is most often than not, our lives revolve around all these names and brands. But what you have to realize is that to create a brand, it takes a lot of efforts. If Apple had started yesterday, would you be buying its products today? It has taken several years of constant excellence, failures, investment, innovation and customer satisfaction to create a brand out of a name. This is what Brand Messi is:"I start early, and I stay late, day after day after day, year after year. It took me 17 years and 114 days to become an overnight success."--Lionel MessiSimilarly, IIT has become a brand today because of great professors, successful alumni, autonomy, huge investment and the talent that goes in. So yes, what the society sees is just the brand, but the brand is so developed that it is enough to capture the product/institute within it.
