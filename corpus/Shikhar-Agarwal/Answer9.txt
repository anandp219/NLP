 The cow, through its powerful strength and immunity, is able to adapt to climate and rains, what come may which eliminates the need of raincoats, jackets and sweaters. It does not waste precious time and resources worrying about fashion, brands and accessories - for it believes that its natural inner-self speaks of its beauty as the exterior is just transient. Through its high self-control, lack of ego, and true realization of oneness and truth, it has turned everlasting lust into eternal bliss and self-satisfaction. And yes, it had foreseen the futility of putting selfies on Facebook before we were born. So our ancient Hindu sages, through an extensive research and meditation spreading over centuries, had concluded long time back that cows do need any clothing, for they have transcended this aspect of materialism at the very least, and therefore we do not clothe them today.And you thought they chose cows to be sacred just like that?
