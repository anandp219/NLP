 One of the most beautiful shloka of Ramayana goes like this:raamam dasharatham viddhi maam viddhi janaka aatmajaam |ayodhyaam aTaviim viddhi gaccha taata yathaa sukham || 2-40-9In this Sumitra, mother of Lakshman, tells him:Know and understand that Ram is like your father Dashratha, in Sita (Janaki) you would find me, the forest is your home Ayodhya, so hey my dearest son Lakshman, a great farewell to thee.Sumitra selflessly convinces Lakshman that he should leave her to join his Rama in his 14 years of exile. Not only this, Urmila, his wife promises him that she would not let a single tear flow from her eyes, lest he becomes weak in his decision. While Sita and Rama were still together in the forest, Sumitra and Urmila chose a worse form of exile for themselves. This is one of the greatest sacrifices in our mythology.
