 Checkout the picture below, observe it and pay attention to your thoughts.(image src: And when we whisper... )I showed it to my friend and he said that it's such a lovely picture - a cute black child is playing with another cute white child. And that's it. The adults in our society would say this. But for the 2 babies in the picture, there is no race, no judgement, no intolerance, no division and no barrier. For each of them, the other is a fellow human being, and they are happy to greet each other with open arms. This is what a human is born into, this is his inherent nature. What do you think, is it good or evil?
