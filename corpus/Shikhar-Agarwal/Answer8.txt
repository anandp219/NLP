 It is discrimination, but not in terms of nationals and foreigners, but purely in terms of economics. This policy closely resembles the Third Degree Price Discrimination which is defined as follows:In third degree price discrimination, price varies by attributes such as location or by customer segment, or in the most extreme case, by the individual customer's identity; where the attribute in question is used as a proxy for ability/willingness to pay. - Price discriminationBefore you think that this is an extreme measure by the government, realize that this "discrimination" happens everyday around you without your conscious notice. Airlines frequently use these policies to charge differently for different classes (Economic, Business and First), time and types of seats depending on the leg room. Even the platinum and gold classes in movie theaters like PVR are created on the same principal.The difference between the above examples and the Taj ticket is that in movies and airlines, you willingly pay - depending upon the luxuries you want, status and so on, but to visit the world's marvel Taj Mahal, the prices are forced upon the visitors. But this is fine - the fact that foreigners have flown to India indicates their ability to pay, and if we convert this to international currencies like dollar or pounds, then it is cheaper than a meal.Discrimination in terms of nationalities is when you go to security at international airports and you are singled out for manual frisking. The Taj pricing is purely economic in nature and well thought of.
