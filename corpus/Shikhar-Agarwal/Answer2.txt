 When a woman fasts to protect her husband on Karva Chauth, people go crazy with the question, "Why should only women fast? Why not men? Isn't this patriarchal mindset?"And now when a brother is promising to protect his sister from adversity on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, you are raising the question, "Doesn't this intent to indicate women are weaker and men are stronger? Isn't this patriarchal mindset?"It has become a fashion today, arising from lack of understanding of the Indian culture, to associate every cultural element to some social evil and then blame them for promoting such practices. Each festival is now being mutated to propagate personal agendas. It seems that the flexibility offered by the religion, which is its one of the biggest strengths, is hurting itself big time, thanks to all the misinformed and hypocritical society.Raksha Bandhan celebrates the bond, love and friendship between siblings; the sister prays for the well being of her brother while the brother promises to protect her under all circumstances. It highlights the family ties, its closeness and the sanskaras that comes from the wisdom of our ancient sages. And this wisdom was always directed towards promoting harmony, quality, brotherhood and love in the society.So no, Raksha Bandhan does not promotes patriarchal society. It is all about love, and it takes love to understand its significance.
