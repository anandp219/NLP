 Let's consider an example to understand the subtlety. Suppose you want to write an answer on Quora to get large number of upvotes. What all things are under your control? You can only write a well-explained answer - you cannot control the number of votes. And therefore Gita says that don't expect upvotes or worry about those, just do your karma of writing great answers and treat this as your dharma to pass knowledge to the readers (which is what Quora's mission is: To share and grow the world's knowledge)Now's let draw an analogy. Whatever Krishna did was to establish dharma because that was his dharma! As a guide for the entire society, his duty was to make the righteous side win, and hence all his actions were directed towards this duty - just like your writing a great answer to spread knowledge.But he neither expected nor expressed the right to the fruits. In fact, after passing down all the knowledge, he gives Arjuna the freedom to choose whatever he wants to do with it. This is the final message of Krishna to Arjuna:iti te jnam khyta, guhyd guhyatara may,vimyaitad aeea, yathecchasi tath kuruWhich means, "Thus I have given to you all the confidential knowledge. Deliberate on this with your full heart and mind, and then do what you wish to do."So just like readers and Quora algorithms decide the upvotes, Krishna only performed his duty and then let Arjuna and others to decide what the actual fruit be. And just like your awesome answer would eventually fetch a lot of upvotes, so did the righteous side win. Krishna just followed his dharma, and let time to decide the outcome.
