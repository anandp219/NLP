 "Cowards die many times before their deaths,The valiant never taste of death but once."- Shakespeare in Julius CaesarShould Sun God have set early that day to deny the glory and fame that Karna deserved? Wouldn't have history remembered Karna as someone who ran and hid under his father's protection when the time came to battle face to face with his only worthy opponent Arjuna? Wouldn't the world have marked his action of donating his protective earrings and sheath to Indra as pure publicity stunt if Karna had taken the protection provided by his father? What better death can befit someone as brave and powerful as Karna than dying at the command of peerless Lord Krishna? Death is certain for anyone born here, especially when Lord is sitting in the chariot opposite to him, wishing that he dies - no sun or moon can save him. Clearly Surya understood that. Wouldn't have he put a blot on his son's life by his intention of helping him?Surya on that day didn't only follow his dharma towards the nature, but a greater dharma towards his son by letting him die in the fashion he deserved. If Surya had helped him, all the respect, glory and his status as epitome of karma, generosity, bravery and courage would have died with him. Karna didn't live to die, but died to live, taking a place in history that perhaps even Arjuna couldn't take. Who wouldn't be proud to have a son like him?Sun did set early that day. But it wasn't the one that you see in the day, it was the one that lit even the night.
