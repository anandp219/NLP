 Ram and Krishna did follow the same principles. Surprised? Read on!You know about the defense mechanism of a chameleon, right? It changes its body colors to match the color of its surrounding so that its hard to detect its presence. So sometimes it turns red, sometimes green and so on. In very loose terms, the underlying principle is the same - to hide from the enemy, the tactics are different to suit the scenario at that time.So both the incarnations followed the same principles which are central to Sanatan Dharma - doing karma according to one's dharma. The tactics, the actions, the karma was done so as to suit the scenarios. Ram was a warrior in the battle, Krishna was a guru and strategist. Ravana, Drona, Bhishma, Karna, etc had to be killed by different ways, and hence same tactics were not possible to apply. While Ram is known as maryada-purshottam, the epitome of dharma, Krishna is sometimes seen as adopting seemingly unfair means [1]. So they "changed colors" according to the situations, but the driving principles were the same.So in your life, keep your principles strong. Never do any action that compromise these. Your principles define your character.Change your opinions, keep to your principles; change your leaves, keep intact your roots - Victor Hugo[1] : How would you justify all the underhanded tactics that Krishna did?
