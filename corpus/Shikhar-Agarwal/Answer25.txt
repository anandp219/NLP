 If you say Vibhishan, would you prefer naming your child "Vibhishan"? If you choose Karna, would you teach your child to befriend a dishonest, cruel, unrighteous person?In the movie Matrix, Morpheus repeatedly tells Neo, "I can only show you the door. It is you who has to walk through it." Similarly Bhagavad Gita defines dharma and says that dharma varies from person to person, but lets a person choose his own. In regular course of life, it is straightforward, but real test comes during a dilemma. For Vibhishan, it was to choose between his evil brother and his reverent Lord Rama. For Karna, it was a choice between his best friend supporting adharma and Pandavas, his real family fighting for good cause. Each of these choices are right and also wrong. Is it right to leave your family in times of difficulties and challenges? Is it right to support and contribute to the evil side?At this junction, the catch is the following: whatever you choose, you would have to accept the consequences. And the problem reduces to choosing the path where you would be happier to accept the outcome. Vibhishan got a kingdom but have you seen any parent naming their child as Vibhishan? No, because it identifies with the word "traitor". But Vibhishan was happier being a devotee and a traitor than supporting Ravana. Karna got all the respect but had to suffer death in the battle. He preferred to die than to live and be considered as a traitor.So both were right because they consciously made their decision to go to the route they went and happily accepted the consequences.
