 In Hinduism, importance is given to one's action, karma, dharma and it's impact rather than on one's identity. The Trinity - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are considered to be superior than the Devas like Indra, because the former have much bigger roles. In Shaktism, Shakti is considered to be superior than the Trinity because she is the energy of all. Thus, these hierarchies are formed due to their responsibilities and actions - dharma and karma.For Rukhmini's case, our mythology has only talked about her identity - she being incarnation of Laxmi, it has never highlighted any of her achievements - and for a reason - unlike the births of Sita and Ram whose objectives, besides establishing dharma, were to set examples of ideal wife, husband, mother, ruler and so on, Krishna's role was to set examples of ideal lover, devotee, friend, guide, guru and to give mankind the lotus-like words of Gita, and Ruhkmini's role was to be his human-consort. One has to understand that this does not imply that she was inferior - it's just that they incarnated for some specific reasons.Now to set an example of an ideal lover and a devotee, one needs other side of the coin too, and here comes Radha, an epitome of selfless love, the love which knew no boundaries, no age, no community. It is this devotion which pulled Krishna to play his beautiful flute, and it is the same devotion which drove Radha to the Raas Leela, forgetting her own self. This love, this devotion, this karma, pure as a prayer, a silent meditation, is what makes Radha divine, this is what turns a devotee into God. Radha-Krishna have been a part of poetry, drama and folklore since time immemorial.So the world worships Radha to celebrate the bond of love and devotion, one of the paths to realize the Truth mentioned in the Gita. Laxmi's incarnation as Rukhmani was supposed to be a silent supporter - very important but less conspicuous. And this was by their own design, their own strategy, their masterplan.
