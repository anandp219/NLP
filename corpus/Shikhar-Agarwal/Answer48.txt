 Because what goes around, comes around. In the end, you are contributing to the development of your own self.Paying proper taxes may get you clean drinking water, 24x7 electricity, and better roads and lights outside your house.Installing solar panels might save your kids from noise and air pollution caused by the generator.The unprivileged child that you help educate might develop a treatment for cancer to save someone in your family.Opening a company will give your kids a job security. You might become a millionaire too.Not giving/taking a bribe would make you understand your responsibility and help control your actions in the face of temptations (for lower fine/ extra money).Not throwing that garbage on the road will keep your environment clean and may prevent diseases in your family.Every little contribution you make, every penny you spend on building this nation is like an investment, like money being put aside in some retirement plan - it would disappear for now, but in the background would keep on compounding, and some day, when it comes back to you, you would be more than grateful and proud of your past for doing that.
