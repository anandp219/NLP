 One of the basic concepts of Unicode is that it abstracts the concept of 'letters' or 'characters' as we understand them in everyday usage from their representation.As the Wikipedia page for Unicode explains: The notion of a code point is used for abstraction, to distinguish both:the number from an encoding as a sequence of bits, andthe abstract character from a particular graphical representation (glyph).This is because one may wish to make these distinctions:encode a particular code space in different ways, ordisplay a character via different glyphs.
