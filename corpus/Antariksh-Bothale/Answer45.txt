 What to do is sometimes said in levity while making a reference to Indian English, with constructions like "What to do yaar?" [What should I do, dude / mate]In Hindi, kya karoon? (which would be the closest match to What to do?) can be a standalone construction. However, in English, What to do? is not grammatically correct as a standalone utterance. It does not have a tensed verb. The verb to do here is in the infinitive form, and in itself cannot complete the sentence. What to do is actually a subordinate noun clause, and would be perfectly fine if used that way. Eg. I didn't know what to do.English is actually particularly finicky in this regard. It requires tensed verbs and subjects almost all the time.
