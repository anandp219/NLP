 The short answer is that they do not. In specific, you should not think of the GRE as the JEE (or GATE) of the United States. Your JEE score is the sole decider of whether or not you get into IIT. On the other hand, the GRE is one of the many variables that are in consideration when deciding the fate of an application. The General GRE is also subject agnostic. It is NOT designed or intended to judge your competence in your major (there are Subject GREs for major-specific testing which are fairly technical and directly relevant). At its more general level, the GRE is for checking your general aptitude for graduate studies.For instance, while many people whine about the Analytical Ability (Verbal) section of the GRE, I think it is actually pretty useful. The expectation is that a person with Graduate level education (no matter what the field) has a fairly high amount of analytical and reasoning skills, along with the ability to correctly analyze texts, draw logical inferences, and express their thoughts in a cogent and cohesive manner. While it is true that this test hinges on one's English vocabulary, the vocabulary level of the GRE is actually pretty reasonable. Likewise, the Quantitative Aptitude section is a general gatekeeper section to ensure that everyone, even those from non-engineering, non-math backgrounds, have a basic level of quantitative ability.We can debate about whether or not the ETS is a giant scam, and whether or not the GRE should be required at all, of course, but don't assume that the GRE is the only thing that decides whether or not you get in.
