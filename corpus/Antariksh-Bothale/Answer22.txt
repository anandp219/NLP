 To better help you out, the mentorship team at IIT Bombay (known as the Institute Student Mentorship Program or ISMP) has come up with a compilation of relevant information for all the UG programs at IITB. This website has a lot of material, and the aim has been to provide students with detailed information about the curriculum and general job portfolios of every department. We try to keep it updated every year with the help of students and alumni. Hopefully, it will help you make a more informed choice. Visit: IIT Bombay Programmes.Apart from you branch, the bigger overall aspect that will affect your experience is of course your life on campus, and for everything about your next 4-5 years at IITB, from academics (or as we like to call itacads) to hostel life to Cultural (cult) and Technical (tech) activities... To give you a better insight into how life@IITB will be and how you can prepare better for your hostel stay, we initiated a "Freshmen Forum" back in 2010, which we hope will be as useful to you as it has been to the previous 5 batches of IIT entrants.Around 70% of all new entrants register on this forum. It is maintained by institute mentors, and is the ideal platform for pre-freshmen (freshie-embryos?) to interact among themselves and with seniors. If you have apprehensions about ragging or want to know what to (not) get from home, you'll find answers to most questions there.Feel free to ask away @ Freshmen Forum 2014.Links:IIT Bombay Programmes Freshmen Forum 2014 - Index
