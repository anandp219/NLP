 When it comes to learning any language, there is nothing special about English. It needs the same kind of effort as learning other languages. The formula is usually straightforward: immersion and performance.Immersion: This is about how much exposure to that language the learner gets. In case of English, this is delightfully easy. We are surrounded by English content. Movies, radio, TV shows, songs, books, magazines, what not. No matter what your interest, you are sure to find English content in it. Encourage her to listen to and read English even if she doesn't understand all of it.Performance: Stimulus is one thing, but the next important thing is to actually use the language. All the time. Without worrying about being wrong. Encourage her to be adventurous and keep trying out new expressions. This is tougher for English because a lot of people already know it well and so there is this default expectation of competence, so she can begin with speaking English to a close group of people who can be expected to be supportive. One of your biggest enemies, if you are learning a language, is the existence of a viable alternative for communication. Even if you can talk to her in Hindi or Tamil, try to speak to her in English. You can speak a bit slowly if required, or explain stuff using different words. Encourage her, but also correct her as needed. Best of luck!
