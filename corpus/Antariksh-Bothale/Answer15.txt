 I think the multilingual dubs of Let it Go are largely an internet phenomenon; and when it comes to the internet, there is very little to gain by creating content in Hindi, since most Indians who consume content on the internet are likely to know English, and many of them might not have Hindi as their first language anyway.Plus, as another person said, it was probably not worth the effort (and investment) for them because India wasn't a strong target market for them even for the movie, let alone for internet videos.This kinda feeds into the side-effects of the linguistic plurality of India and the dominance of English among the educated masses. You would see a general lack of quality and quantity when it comes to production and consumption of content in non-English languages by Indians. It is our own doing. How many of us English-knowing Hindi speakers consume (let alone create) Hindi content, in any form? Do we read blogs in Hindi? Do we tweet or put FB statuses in Hindi? When was the last time someone staying in a big city read a Hindi newspaper? We are the hip crowd who, every time the Hindi dub of an English movie is released, can't go beyond the "omg what a ridiculous translation of the movie title. wtf is naagshakti why can't they just say Slytherin". This is a chicken and egg problem. There aren't too many good Hindi fonts, nor is there quality content in Hindi (whether in the terms of blogs or news websites or whatever) proportional to the number of people who speak it.Disney movies and shows usually do get dubbed into Hindi (and even Tamil, Telugu etc.) for Indian Television, so I guess they do bother to put in the effort when they think it'll be worth it.
