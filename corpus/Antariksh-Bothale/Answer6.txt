 So far, it looks unlikely that any language will replace English as the lingua franca in the foreseeable future. Imperialism is largely a thing of the past and we don't have large-scale wars anymore, and nothing is actively stemming the growth of English, and, in general, I don't see how any other language will rise to that position given the inertia that English has.English became dominant at a crucial time: the spread of globalism and the rise of digital technology and internet have more or less cemented this dominance. Many languages would have been considered to be so-called world languages at various points of time in history, but the first truly global language was and is English. I mean, no language even comes close. The only potential language that people keep touting is Mandarin, but I don't think it stands a chance either. Even if you were to discount for the extreme tall barrier that their writing system is, the fact is that none of the candidate languages have the kind of global traction that is needed for a language to become the lingua franca.
