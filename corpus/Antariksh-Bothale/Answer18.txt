 A resume of some sort is usually always required when applying for any position (even those procured via personal contacts, which involve Dad calling his friend who works at a good company and requesting them to place you).You might not have a lot of stuff to write about in your second year resume, but that applies to most people who have just finished freshmen year. Don't worry about it. I just went through my freshie year resume for reference. Consider including the following stuff:Your rank in standardized exams: JEE, BITSAT etc. Olympiad performance (if applicable)Your Class X and XII Board percentageCourse project you did in first year, if applicableAny extra-curricular activities that you were part of in first yearAny other school level competitive exams that you might have participated in (NSO, NSTSE, NCO etc.)Any major activities or clubs that you were a part of in high school, or competitions you won, or positions you head, such as head boy / girl or House captainAny other awards or honors that you won in high school or first yearBest of luck!
