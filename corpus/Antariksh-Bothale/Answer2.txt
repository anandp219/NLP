 As a student, you would probably want to intern with multiple companies to get a wider range of experience and exposure. This might be helpful in making career choices later on, and at the very least would also broaden your network.Of course, this might change a bit based on other variables. At big companies like Google, one internship might be very different from another based on what teams you are on. Another potential scenario I can think of is if you are in a research internship and have developed a good relationship with your adviser. In this case, if returning helps you go deeper into the field and get good quality publications etc., you might want to return there especially if you are planning to apply to grad school.
