 Most social niceties are a 'waste of time'. But we extend them out of basic courtesy. The question then isn't about whether it is a waste of time, but whether the context needs you to ask that question.It is always about context. If you are in an office in America, and your colleague is German, you don't need to ask them if they know English. If you have been invited for dinner to a German family with whom you have not previously interacted, it might be nice to confirm that they are comfortable talking in English. If you are in Germany and are shopping in the market, you should probably not only definitely ask, but also ensure that you do it in an apologetic rather than demanding tone.
