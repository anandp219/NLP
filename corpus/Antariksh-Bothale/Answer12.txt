 Beef is relatively uncommon at food places in India (restaurants, fast food joints etc). Popular joints such as McDonalds avoid controversy and maximize clientele by eschewing both beef and pork. However, you can find beef either at more upscale restaurants in cities like Mumbai or in hole-in-the-wall places in specific areas, such as in localities with a high concentration of Muslims (eg. Kurla). I imagine you could also find beef at touristy places with a generally high availability of Non-Vegetarian food (so Goa works, but Rajasthan won't).
