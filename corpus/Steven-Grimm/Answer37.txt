 You'll occasionally find yourself thinking in your new language and then, upon wanting to express one of these thoughts to someone who doesn't speak that language, realize that you have to translate the thought back to your native tongue. And then you'll realize that you can't think of a good way to say it in your own language, and you'll end up saying something that sounds horribly awkward.On the other hand, that's a sure indication that your new language has penetrated deep into your mind, so it's not too negative a side effect.
