 Yes, because it reduces my ability to make use of Quora's social features. Being anonymous cripples Quora a little bit for everyone else.If a question or answer is good, I may want to follow you in the hopes you'll continue to write things I find interesting.If a question or answer is awful, I may want to mute you to stop you from reducing the average quality of my Quora feed in the future.When you're anonymous, I can't do either thing, so you've made Quora less functional for me, and I dislike people making Quora less functional for me.That said, the inability to follow and mute is not a property of anonymity per se. Quora could add the ability to follow and mute anonymous users in a way that wouldn't reveal their identities. If that ability existed, much of my dislike would go away. But it doesn't currently exist, and I can only form my opinion based on the current state of affairs.In cases where there's a solid reason for anonymity, e.g., revealing information about people or companies or governments that would put you in danger, the benefit outweighs the cost. So clearly the anonymity feature serves a valid purpose. But such cases, at least in my feed, seem to be a vanishingly tiny minority of the content that's posted anonymously.Empirically, based on some passes I've done through my feed at various times, I find that over half of the content in my Quora feed that I'd consider noise rather than signal is from anonymous questions. And only about 15-20% of the content I consider worthwhile is from anonymous questions. This is a big enough drag on my feed quality that I actually wrote a browser extension to auto-hide anonymous questions from my feed. Sadly, it triggered Quora's request rate limiting and I haven't had the time and motivation to do the work required to fix that -- maybe someday soon.
