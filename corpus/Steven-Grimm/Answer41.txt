 It really depends on what your actual reading level is -- "beginner" is pretty vague, and if you're a complete beginner with fewer than a few hundred characters under your belt, you will have an extremely tough time making it through any Chinese novel, even children's books. A couple recommendations assuming you're past that level:The Lady in the Painting is a novelization of a folk tale. It assumes the reader knows 300 basic characters; it introduces a few more but mostly sticks to that limited vocabulary. This was the first full book I ever read in Chinese, though it's a pretty short one.The Chinese Breeze series consists of books at a few different skill levels, starting at about a 300-word vocabulary.Once you're at a point where you can read the Chinese Breeze books reasonably well, I recommend ditching the "for beginners" requirement and getting some native-speaker reading material whose subject matter is of interest to you. For example, I'm currently on book three of Liu Cixin's "Three-Body" series, which is considered by a lot of people to be the best science-fiction trilogy to come out of China. It is definitely not beginner-level material; it is written for adult native speakers and I wouldn't have been ready to tackle it before studying Chinese for several years. But the story is right up my alley so I'm compelled to keep reading to see what happens next, even if it constantly throws new words and phrases at me.Another piece of advice: use technology to your advantage. Whenever I buy a Chinese novel, I also immediately track down an electronic copy so I can load it into the Pleco app on my iPad and read it there. The Pleco reader feature has dictionary integration built in, so I can tap on an unfamiliar word and get a definition (and even add the word to my flashcard list if I want) without losing the flow of the story. Trying to read a paper book using a separate dictionary to look up new words is far, far less engrossing, not to mention much slower.
