 First, decide which Taiwanese accent you want, because there's more than one. Broadly speaking, southerners and northerners have noticeably different accents; the accent in the south is further removed from standard Mandarin. There are smaller regional variations but south-north is the big obvious split.Assuming you want to sound like a southerner, here are a few of the obvious differences that you can practice on your own. All my formal instruction in Mandarin used a standard mainland putonghua accent (which I did my best to pick up) but I married a woman from southern Taiwan, just so you know what perspective this is from. A lot of this isn't unique to Taiwan per se, but is also found in the accents of southern areas of the mainland.Neutral tone is used far, far less than in putonghua. For example, in putonghua,  (fly) is pronounced, "cngying" but the Taiwanese pronounce the tone of the second syllable and it's, "cngyng."There is almost no  (changing the final sound of a syllable to "r"). It happens a little bit, but in general if you practice never doing it at all, you'll be pretty close. Example: mainlanders pronounce / as "dir" (and the  is often included in written form) while Taiwanese say, "din."There are some consonant shifts that happen a lot of the time but not all the time:"ch" becomes "c" --  is read, "ho c" rather than, "ho ch.""sh" becomes "s" --  and  are pronounced the same."zh" becomes "z" --  is read, "znglng" rather than, "zhnglng."The "r" sound is often not enunciated.  comes out sounding like the English word, "Uh." I remember when I'd just met my wife and she told me the price of something was $22, she said, "h s h kui" and, having only learned the putonghua pronunciation, I had no idea what she meant.I welcome corrections or clarifications from native speakers; these are just the main differences I've personally observed.
