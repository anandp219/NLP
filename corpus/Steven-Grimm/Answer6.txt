 Probably not. One reason is that many characters have more than one pronunciation, so you'd have to either choose just one (which would mean either flat-out not listing the others or having multiple glyphs for the same Chinese character, which in turn would mean you could no longer use any of the standard Chinese encoding systems to locate characters in your font) or list them all and use such tiny pinyin that it'd be basically unreadable. For example, the character  can be read xng, hng, hng, hng, or heng depending on context, and it's not a matter of, "One normal pronunciation and a bunch of obscure ones you wouldn't have to learn." The first two of those are both very commonly used.The target market is really pretty narrow -- this wouldn't be useful to anyone except beginning learners of Chinese, and even then, for educational materials you'll typically want to format the pinyin separately from the characters anyway so as to have proper word spacing. The correct pinyin for  is "pngyu" and not "png yu," but if the Latin characters were attached to the Chinese ones, you'd have no ability to control that spacing.However, it should be possible to take an existing Chinese font and write software to alter it based on the pronunciations from a Chinese dictionary. As far as I know, nobody has yet done so.
