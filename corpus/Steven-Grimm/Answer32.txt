 Flashcards are a useful supplementary tool, but they need to be secondary to other techniques such as regular conversation and writing practice and regular reading of texts in your language of choice. As long as you're focused mostly on those other things, flashcards (especially software flashcards with a good spaced repetition algorithm) can boost your retention to a modest degree.One reason flashcards don't work well as a primary learning tool is that no language is a carbon copy of your native language with the vocabulary switched to an alternate set of words. So memorizing definitions isn't enough; you need to know how the words are put together in actual use. For example, if you have a flashcard that helps you memorize the fact that "" is the Chinese word for "to be," that won't help you remember that Chinese doesn't always use the concept of "to be" the way English does; if you naively try to say, "He is hungry" using that word, the sentence will make no sense. If you read a lot, you'll come across the equivalent Chinese sentence enough times that you won't be tempted to write or say it the wrong way.Flashcards also don't help you smoothly recall words in context, which is vital for conversation. If you rely too heavily on them, your brain will train itself to take seconds to recall a single word, and you won't be able to talk to anyone without constantly pausing to recall words. Of course, no matter what, that's going to happen sometimes, but in my experience as a flashcard-using language learner, it'll happen a lot less if you're used to seeing, hearing, and using your new words in the context of a sentence or a paragraph rather than in isolation. Example sentences on the flashcards can help bridge a bit of that gap but not all of it.
