 That salary would typically allow one to live quite comfortably in Sunnyvale, but that's nothing more than a general answer, and it sounds like you're not ultimately looking for a general answer here. Sadly, once you stop talking generalities and start talking about a particular person, you can't draw solid conclusions about quality of life based on a single number. There's too much you haven't told us (or possibly don't know) about this man you suspect is a liar.Is he the sole breadwinner for several children?Does he have dependents who need expensive medical care?Does he have lots of student debt?Is he divorced and legally required to pay a lot of alimony every month?Until you know the answers to those questions and a bunch of others along the same lines, it's impossible to arrive at an accurate answer to the question of what it's like to be this man making the salary he makes. It's possible you're exactly right: maybe he is lying about his life, or is in a bad position because he makes bad choices. But you can't be certain without more information.About the best you can say for sure is, "It's better than making less than $120K in Sunnyvale as a software engineer."
