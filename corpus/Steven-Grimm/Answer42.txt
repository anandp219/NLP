 I've found it most helpful to use software that can test each element independently. Pleco's flashcard system, for example, supports that. You could get much the same effect with physical cards if you used multiple cards per vocabulary word, e.g.,Pinyin // CharactersEnglish // Charactersand, if you like, the third combinationEnglish // PinyinThe nice thing about this setup is that it lets you account for different levels of recall of different aspects of a word. If you have no trouble remembering what a given set of characters means, but a harder time remembering how to pronounce it, you can focus on just the pronunciation part (and not waste time on the meaning) by repeating just that card more often.
