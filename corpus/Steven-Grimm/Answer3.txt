  makes much more sense to me as the character for "tear" than . Water + eye = teardrop. Water + door + dog = a wet dog entering the house? (Though as John Renfroe notes in his comment, the right side of the traditional character is actually a phonetic component, not a semantic one.)But "inferior" is totally subjective and depends on which criteria you personally consider important. Simplified characters are often faster and easier to write, so if that's important to you, then lots of them will seem superior to their traditional counterparts. It's much easier to write (and learn!)  than , for example.If, on the other hand, your favorite thing about Chinese characters is intricacy and complexity, simplification will almost never be an improvement.
