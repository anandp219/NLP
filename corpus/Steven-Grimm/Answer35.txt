 There isn't one, because "fastest" and "easiest" are mutually incompatible and "best" is too subjective to have a single answer.The easiest way? One possibility: listen to language lessons during your daily commute. I recommend Pimsleur as a starting point. It requires little effort beyond talking back to a recording.The fastest way? Move to a place where that language is spoken and your native one isn't, and enroll yourself in language classes there. The classes will give you a foundation, and the environment will give you constant reinforcement and practice. You'll learn quickly but "easy" won't be a word you'll use to describe the process.
