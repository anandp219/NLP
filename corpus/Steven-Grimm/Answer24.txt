 Yes. In the consumer software and Internet space alone, see, for example, Skype (Estonia), Baidu (China), Spotify (UK), Shazam (UK), AVG Technologies (Netherlands), Rovio (Finland), Unity (Denmark), and Dianping (China). Plenty of examples to choose from on the hardware side too.In some countries it's harder to get a tech startup going than in others for various legal, cultural, or financial reasons. But clearly there have been technology companies started outside the borders of the United States that became successful, and there's no reason to think that won't continue to happen in the future.
