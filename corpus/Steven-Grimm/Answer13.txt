 Starting with Portal or any other game that plays like a first-person shooter might be a mistake for a couple reasons. First, the controls are likely to be frustrating for someone who has absolutely no experience coordinating mouse movement with the direction of movement and view. Second, a significant percentage of people experience motion sickness from first-person-perspective games. This often diminishes with repeated exposure, but you don't want your friend's first gaming experience to be literally nausea-inducing.The first question I'd ask would be whether your friend plays any games that aren't computerized, e.g., board or card games. If so, those will give you a great entry point: start with a game that's like one of those, but slightly enhanced. There are hundreds of "Solitaire with powerups" kinds of games out there, e.g., Fairway Solitaire. If he plays games such as Risk, a 4X game would likely hold his interest. The Civilization series is one possibility depending on how much complexity you think he can deal with.If he doesn't play any games at all in real life but likes puzzles, there are tons of puzzle games to choose from, e.g., Monument Valley.Barring that, your Telltale idea is a decent one. Those games are heavily story-driven and emotionally engaging. The only concern I'd have is that if he thinks games are childish, stories about zombies and werewolves might not do a lot to change his mind. To the Moon might be a better choice in that case.Another option is something abstract like Osmos, with no story and no characters, just simple shapes.In general I'd look to the casual game space rather than the kinds of games hardcore gamers usually play; casual games are designed from the ground up to be highly accessible and generally make far fewer assumptions about one's existing experience or skill.
