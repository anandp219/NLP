 It is sometimes easy, but not always easy and sometimes not possible at all.The crux of the problem is that it's hard to tell when you incorrectly conclude that someone is a native speaker. Short of going around and asking all the writers on Quora whether or not they're native English speakers, how would you confirm your judgement?I can often tell whether a particular mistake or awkward turn of phrase is likely to have come from a non-native speaker. There are indeed patterns of writing that are vanishingly rare among natives, and when I see one of those, I immediately know that the writer learned English as a second language. In some cases I can even guess what the writer's native language is. Most native English speakers who've spent much time reading text by non-natives can probably do the same.But if there are no awkward phrases or grammar errors or strange word choices in a piece of writing, all I can conclude is that the author has near-native-level fluency in English. The absence of the kinds of errors typical of non-native speakers does not prove that English is the author's mother tongue.And here is where it's easy to fall victim to a cognitive bias and a logical error. Anyone who believes they can always pick out the writing of a non-native speaker because they've seen lots of obvious examples of non-native-speaker text is falling victim to a common fallacy called denying the antecedent:If there are mistakes a native speaker wouldn't make, the writer learned English as a second language.There are no mistakes a native speaker wouldn't make.Therefore, the writer did not learn English as a second language.#3 does not follow from #1 and #2.The only viable basis of an unqualified, blanket "yes" answer -- as opposed to a "most of the time" answer -- is to believe that it is literally impossible for any non-native speaker to ever write the exact same piece of text a native speaker would have written. That idea seems clearly ridiculous to me.
