 One cause of the confusion behind this question is that when the tonal nature of Chinese is described to English speakers, "'ma' can mean horse or mother!" is always the first (and often the only) example given. The question details are absolutely correct that in most cases, context would allow one to easily distinguish those two specific examples.Here are some other examples where it may be easier to imagine the wrong tones changing the meaning of a sentence but still making sense in context. fnrn = an ordinary person fnrn = a criminal fnrn = an aborigine fwn = dispatch a message fwn = ask a question difu = doctor dif = godfather (older usage), on one's father's behalf dif = Dave xfng = a room set aside for a new baby xfng = a room on the west side of a houseDespite the wishes to the contrary of thousands of beginning students of Mandarin, tones are really not an optional part of the spoken language, and native speakers both use them and listen for them 100% of the time on a subconscious level. They're just part of the pronunciation, not an extra thing on top of the pronunciation.Get them wrong in a way that isn't typical of a well-known regional variation in native-speaker pronunciation and your listener might be able to figure out what you meant to say, but you'll be forcing them to do more work to understand you. And they'll guess wrong, or completely fail to come up with a possible interpretation, some percentage of the time.
