 You're operating under the assumption that the goal of pinyin is to allow native English speakers to come close to correct pronunciation of Mandarin without special training. But that isn't, and never was, the goal; it was developed by Chinese scholars for use as an instructional aid by Chinese teachers teaching pronunciation to Chinese students. Whether or not untrained foreigners could read it easily was not a primary concern.Mangling pronunciations of written words isn't unique to Chinese and pinyin! Show an English speaker the word "croissant" and see if a monolingual French speaker can work out what "crew saunt" is supposed to mean. Or, heck, show a native Mandarin speaker the standard Chinese transliteration of my name and see how many English speakers make the connection between "shr tee foo" and "Steven."There are plenty of older romanization systems to choose from. The Yale system is probably the best suited of the major ones for the goal you're looking for, namely, achieving the closest approximation of correct pronunciation using English pronunciation rules with no prior training. If you're a Chinese person who is concerned about English-speaking foreigners butchering your name, in a lot of cases you're free to romanize it in whatever way you like and you can just put the Yale romanization on your business card. (Of course, French- or Spanish-speaking foreigners will proceed to read it using their own languages' pronunciation rules and you'll be back to square one.)But it's the prerogative of China to decide on the official romanization system for its national language, and they chose pinyin. It's not going away any time soon regardless of what anyone thinks about it.
