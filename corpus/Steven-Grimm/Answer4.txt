 Even today you don't have to search too hard on the Internet to find humans who are sexually attracted to nonhuman organisms of all different shapes and sizes. It's almost certain that at least a handful of the billions of members of the human race would find just about any kind of alien a sexual turn-on. Those people might be considered sexual deviants by most of humanity, but the attraction would still exist.The "mutual" part would depend on the aliens. For one thing, it would require that they reproduce sexually; if they have no ability to feel sexual attraction at all, then by definition they couldn't be mutually attracted to humans. But it's not too hard to imagine sexually-reproducing aliens that have the same kinds of variance in individual taste that humans do, which would mean a greater-than-zero chance of mutual attraction with a human.Mutual attraction gets more likely the more physically similar the aliens are to humans, and gets a huge boost if there's some means by which actual reproduction is possible (it's no wonder there are so many half-humans running around in the "Star Trek" universe!) but I don't think even extreme physical differences would cause the probability to drop to zero.
