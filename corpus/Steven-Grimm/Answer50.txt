 A good resource is the tour brochure from Koryo Group, viewable from their Tours & Tour Dates page. Any place in that brochure is, you can assume, open to foreign tourists (or they wouldn't bother listing it). Of course, "open" in North Korea still means you'll be accompanied by a guide at all times and made to stick to a predetermined itinerary. And certain places may only be open at certain times.Here's what's in the current version of the brochure as of July 2014:PyongyangPyongsongKaesongNampoMount Kuwol, Sinchon & SariwonHaejuMt.

Myohyang, so I can confirm firsthand that tourists are allowed out of Pyongyang.
