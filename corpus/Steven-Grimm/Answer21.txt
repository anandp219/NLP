 For the most part: we don't view it at all. To the extent it exists among the Indian immigrant community in the USA, it is completely invisible to Americans who don't have very close ties to that community.Among the tiny minority of Americans who are aware it exists in their country and have opinions about it, I think you would have to search for a long time to find even a single person who thinks it's anything other than ignorant and backward; it represents exactly the opposite of many of the principles that Americans of all political stripes hold dear.Leaving behind the shackles and prejudices of one's previous society and starting from scratch on a level playing field is a core part of the idealized narrative of American immigration, even if in practice it doesn't always work out that way.
