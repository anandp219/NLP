 That's not quite the right question to ask; here's why. Programming languages aren't like human languages, with each new one requiring years of effort to reach sufficient fluency to use for work purposes. For the most part if you know a language of a particular style, you can quickly learn any other language of the same style well enough become usefully productive, sometimes in a matter of weeks, even though you won't yet have explored all the nooks and crannies. (By "style" I'm referring to broad families of languages, of which there are several -- but don't worry about that for now.)So your goal as a beginning programmer is not to carefully choose the one and only one language you will be stuck using for the rest of your career. Rather, it's to establish the fundamentals you'll use to pick up whatever language is appropriate for the task at hand.What you should concern yourself with as a beginner is the concepts and the mindset that you'll need no matter what language you're using, and pretty much any major language will get you there. So you should shoot for whichever language you find most pleasant and find yourself picking up most readily. And that'll probably be whichever language has tutorials or books you find most closely suit your learning style.My advice: pick four or five popular languages and Google for beginner tutorials in each. Give each tutorial a few hours of your time and then continue pursuing whichever one you enjoy most or makes you feel like you're learning the most. You may end up switching to another language later in your learning process but you'll have had a good taste of the pleasure of the craft and will have learned some basics that'll help you get a running start later.
