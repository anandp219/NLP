 The other answers offer excellent advice. A few specific things to add to the list:Learn a bit of Hack. Facebook no longer uses vanilla PHP, though knowing PHP is a good starting point. Hack is based on PHP but with some very significant changes. It's worth looking at as an interesting case study in backward-compatible language design even if you don't end up needing to use it for your work there.Check out Phabricator and get at least a cursory familiarity with its tools. It's what Facebook uses for code review.Play around with Mercurial until you have at least a basic level of proficiency. If you're familiar with git already, it shouldn't be too much work since the two have very similar underlying conceptual models.But in general, don't stress out too much about it. Facebook fully expects interns to spend time learning on the job; that's one of the points of having an internship program in the first place.
