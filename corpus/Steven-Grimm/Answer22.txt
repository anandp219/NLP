 As of the midseason finale of year two of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., they seem to be going full steam ahead with a version of the Inhumans backstory that follows the comics pretty closely, from the presence of the Kree on ancient Earth to the use of Terrigen Mist to the presence of buried ancient cities.Clearly this has been the plan since long before an Inhumans movie was announced, since it's the culmination of a bunch of previously dangling plot threads that were laid out practically from the start of the show.The rights issues between Marvel and other movie studios will necessarily change the details to some degree, e.g., by removing X-Men-style mutants from the equation and (though there's some ambiguity here) preventing the use of the Skrull. But the big picture seems to be right in line with the comics.One interesting aspect of this in the context of "how it fits into the MCU" is that, other than a couple prequel comics, it's the first instance of one of the non-movie productions setting up backstory for subsequent movies. Previously, the plot points only ever flowed in the opposite direction. I think that's a positive development for the long-term health of the MCU: it's no longer possible to dismiss the TV side of the universe as a second-fiddle tie-in that never has any impact on the "real" MCU, and cements the vision of the MCU as a single big interconnected whole.
