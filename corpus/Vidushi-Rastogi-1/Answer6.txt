 Curious question it is.A pessimist me would say that 'many' might deem you unfit for nuptial knot. You live in a country where even fair complexion is a check box when it comes bride hunting; forget about T1D & Stargardt disease (Heredomacular degeneration).An optimist me would say- Dude! Chuck marriage. Learn to manage your challenges, love will come along following.During my stint as a T1D researcher, I have met many patients who gave up on their challenge, fell into depression and became ugly (in the literal sense). I also met couples where one partner was all healthy and helped in managing the challenges of the other partner. They were happy people, seemingly normal, talked about happy things, looked beautiful and were OPTIMISTIC. IMHO, you should focus more on managing your challenges, stabilizing both T1D & SD. Feel good about yourself and love will come following. Learn about people who are fighting the same challenge and winning hands down. It will boost your morale. Shun everybody who makes you feel deficient. There is lot of literature to manage T1D. SD people can wear cool sunglasses. I am told that it really helps. Hope you find love :)
