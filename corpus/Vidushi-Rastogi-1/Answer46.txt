 Hell Yes !My husband has been friends with two people for 8 years now.They have been living together all these years and have survived professional and personal turmoils. They are so close that their families consider themselves to be having 3 sons. Inseparable they are. They share some common interests (like travel , photography , movies and shopping) but have colossal differences in nature. My husband , Harsh and Vishal are business analysts and Amit is a chef. People familiar with hospitality industry must be knowing that they have a difficult lifestyle , long work hours and no holidays. Irrespective of his erratic hours , they try to have at least one meal together. I have seen them waiting for hours just to eat together. They pick on each other , throw snide comments , call each other names but can't live without. I became friends with them when I was dating my husband. Since then we have been like 4 pieces of a pie. We four have been staying together even after we got married (this was supposedly the litmus test of their friendship !)Our home is like Central Perk. We have our weekdays like people have their weekends. Imagine evenings when your friends are lying on couch drinking , eating and laughing while music plays. We have a literal ROFL moment almost everyday. It is not that we don't have problems , it is just we don't let them grow over us. We don't bring professional woes when we are together , though we discuss when it is required. We don't bicker over tiny issues. We give each other necessary space and respect privacy. We try to stay together.Here is our picture :)L --> R Vishal , Harsh , Me and Amit.
