 T1D cure has been testing the patience of researchers. The cure has been distant because,Incomplete understanding of the mechanism of disease development and progression precludes development of rationally designed drug.i.e. You can't fight an enemy if you barely know its origin, strategy of advancement and the system that it has eyes on. However the advancement made in the last decade is way more than previous. The glitch is that it is not an obvious result that masses understand. People want to see headlines that we have cured T1D and they can avail the medicine at the nearest drug store. We are far from that. But that doesn't mean we are not progressing. Each discovery is a milestone and each clinical trial failure costs billions and decades. It takes approximately 15 years to get the therapy safe for deployment under registered practitioners. So the technology (sic) is not slowly advancing, it's just that you don't notice its silent achievements.
