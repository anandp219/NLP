 Ant man is a cinematic treat. SPOILERS AHEAD.The conceptFor a person unequipped with the intricacies of a super hero character, it doesnt discriminate. You are narrated the origin and conflict of the protagonist so well that it becomes extremely relatable. There is a father with an estranged daughter, a mentee feeling betrayed by his mentor because the latter did not impart all knowledge, a father who falls to commit crime whenever under duress and wants to provide everything for his little daughter. Added to all this is a technology which obviously has political repercussions. But what makes Antman so awesome? It is its script that seamlessly weaves all of it in one fabric.The dialoguesI found them the most engaging part of the movie after the concept. They are sarcastic, funny and offer a fair share of giggles. Michael Penas (Luis) lip sync, Michael Douglas (Pym) shoot me again, Evangeline Lillys (Hope) fight with Paul Rudd (Scott Lang) and Scotts daughter, Cassies this toy is so ugly are hilarious. Even people with no interest in MCU could engage in the movie because of clever scriptwriting. Coupled with the awesome dialogues, the reference to the Avengers is comical.The visual effectsIt is almost a routine that Marvel are surpassing their own milestones when it comes to visuals. While the Ant man reminds you of vintage rustiness and the yellow jacket is technologically more violent. The portrayal of ants makes you perceive these creatures in an altogether new way. The quantum realm is so beautifully imagined that it looks almost real. Particularly the fight scenes at toy train are remarkably scripted. For the most part visuals dont override the live characters. All in all, the movie is much more worth than money. We walk out of the theatre wanting more. Also, it introduces Ant man to the mass in general who have only known likes of Iron Man, Super Man and Batman.
