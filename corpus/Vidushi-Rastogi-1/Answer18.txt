 There are several therapies aimed to alleviate/curb T1D, that are somewhere in the medical pipeline.One of them is Autoimmune therapy that I worked with.(Know more about Autoimmune therapy here - Vidushi Rastogi's answer to What are the newest advancements to help control Diabetes Type 1? )Every year, researchers stumble upon a promising cure that dies as it progresses through clinical trials.This absolutely doesn't mean that we are not progressing. T1D is a complex disorder with very poorly known causes. We can't fight an unknown enemy easily. With the knowledge that we have about T1D, we are actually doing good.For people unknown of clinical trials, its a multi step, complicated, monitored and regulated test of potential medicines. One crucial step is to test them at mice, dog or monkeys. Human trial is a very advanced stage. It's a milestone to get positive result with other species but the final destination is not so close. In the quoted article the researchers have used Gene Therapy. We are a bit far to get it safely approved for human beings. The article concludes,In conclusion, this study paves the way for the clinical translation of this approach to gene therapy to veterinary medicine, and eventually to diabetic patients.So the answer is YES. A cure for T1D is on the way, but the success would test our patience.
