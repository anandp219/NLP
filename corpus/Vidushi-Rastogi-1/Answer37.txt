 I can't stop myself doing some maths regarding up-votes.Lets make an index ,Popularity of content normalised with number of followers , Actual popularity= Number of followers / Number of up-votes.In the question Actual popularity of the writers is same.TW 10k followers/2k up-votes= 5 , Another guy 100 followers/20 up-votes = 5The appreciation is proportionate. Now coming to content , the another guy  has added more information to the content but his audience is limited and the content doesn't reach to its desired appreciation. The TW  with his massive following takes the cherry of the cake. This seemingly non-proportionate appreciation has come from his previous work on quora or his work in real life. A two line answer by Jimmy Wales fetches >1k up-votes every time because we respect him for his works in real life and we are really glad that he typed those two lines.For an audience either you are a good writer or an important person in real life. If you are neither , become a follower of either and get benefitted.Thanks for A2A.
