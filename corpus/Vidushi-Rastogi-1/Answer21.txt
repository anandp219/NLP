 My ring finger bears the tattoo of my husband's name, Harsh (he was my boyfriend then and later fiancee for sometime).I got it because, I always wanted to. It was his birthday gift. This might sound cheesy and overly romantic to some but I could never think of anything but his name to get permanently inked.Some quipped me over it that I took PDA to another level, some commented that I am inspired by a growing trend among celebrities, others thought that I could use it to emotionally blackmail him. So much for a little tattoo!A lot of people emphasized that I could have waited till getting engaged or married, with extra emphasis on the fact that it's difficult to get tattoo removed.Harsh's reaction was "Wow! supercool! But you could have waited, we could get it together".He was concerned about healing, especially when the tattoo looked hideous during scabbing.It means a lot. Most of the time I am oblivious of its existence, but when somebody points it out or when I see it in quiet hours, it reflects on my love for him and his for mine.I guess the sole feeling that drives people to get tattooed is seeking an omni reminder about something that you care for.Here is the pic,
