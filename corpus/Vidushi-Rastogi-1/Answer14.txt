 Sustain interest. Whatever it might take.There can be situations with potential to rob you of interest in science or may be life.Rest all things will be easy.Basic sciences test your patience. You will be hearing following on a daily basis:There is not much that you can do with basic sciences. Either you become a scientist or a professor.You will have to wait till your hair turns gray, to make a living out of your career.You will be low on money in your youth, when you need it the most.You will be in the lowest of the league when it comes to finding a girlfriend or a boyfriend.You will see your friends who opted some vague discipline of studies, making much more money and progressing in every form of life.You will spend your life in a lab thinking about grants and educating people who will get frustrated eventually. It is unfortunate that the above points are true to some extent. In India they become even more pronounced. You wonder what made your mind to commit social suicide. Having said that, there are people who braved all of them and were lucky to make a fulfilling career. They are earning reasonable and are renowned in scientific fraternity. Some are in good positions in companies and are influencing the way we live our lives.So, my friend,Everybody would tell you to read the most complicated books, to complete your projects on time, to keep studying even when you feel giving up, to develop scientific aptitude, to follow scientific blogs, research journals... But nobody would tell you to live life just like student of any other discipline, have fun, go for a movie, fall in love and make mistakes; so that you thrive and grow to be a better person.Don't get consumed by your goals.Thanks for A2A :)
