 The movie distribution is obviously driven by revenue generation. If the cost of screening a movie in a town/ city is not significantly lower than the revenue it is projected to generate, then the town/city would be passed.In tier 2 and tier 3 cities, fandom base of superhero movies is passable. The residents might enjoy movies like Terminator in local language, where there is an entertaining violence. But for superhero movies they might not be motivated enough to flock theatres. Also a factor to be considered is local language. The cost of dubbing a movie in a local language should be more than compensated in the revenue that it will generate in that town/city. In addition, some popular movies are screened later in non-metro cities when they have shown good business in metro i.e. when they become good bets.Thanks for A2A :)
