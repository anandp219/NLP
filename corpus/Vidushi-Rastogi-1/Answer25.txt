 The male penis swells inside the female's vagina during the mating, causing them to get virtually locked. It is absolutely normal phenomenon. They might be locked for some good 15-20 minutes during which ejaculation takes place. One should not attempt to separate them, to allow successful mating. A small bone is found inside the dog's penis called baculum that holds the penis while attempting penetration. Once the penis has reached inside the vagina, the bulbus glandis (found at base of penis) will start to congest with blood and swells, to eventually lock the mating couple. It is popularly called mating tie.Sometimes in disparate mating, larger size female (or a virgin female) gets panicked and swings the male while its penis is still stuck inside. Poor guy!P.S. This is a common knowledge, only if people take the pain of typing at search engine.
