Dont stuff your pet with the food of your liking. Select a food from best dog food brands according to body weight, breed and age of your pet. Food requirement of a puppy differs from an adult dog and a nursing bitch.Diverse nutritionNutrients differ in their goodness with their sources. So its important that you provide a diverse cuisine instead of feeding the same dry food pellets. Market is replete with dog treats, dog canned food, dog snacks and whatnot. The food platter of your dog should be diverse besides being healthy.Omnivore nutritionDogs are genetically omnivore. Their natural food habit is eating lower animals.
