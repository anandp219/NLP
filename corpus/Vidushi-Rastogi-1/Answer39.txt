 I have been lucky enough to receive attention & respect from my family , friends and colleagues but that is mutual . They reciprocate the attention & respect I offer to them. However people around me acknowledge that I know a little more about many things.It is different from Quora where I don't reciprocate the attention I receive. For example I follow a very small fraction of my followers. Though I try to gift credits and send PMs.I have many answers on dating , relationships , loneliness and life advice and now I can't recall even a single person who came to me for an advice on a related issue. There have not been many incidences in real life where people would come to me for an advice. But yes , I had an opportunity to help people to crack university entrances in Biotechnology/Molecular Biology. It has been very gratifying experience which is beyond any number of up-votes.Thanks for A2A Gauri Noolkar :)
