 Hey, caste fellas! Everytime you use your caste card- YOU SNATCH A DREAM!1. Should the whole of Germany work and feel sorry for what Nazis did? And keep their heads down forever to the whole world?2. Should Rahul Gandhi feel sorry for the blunders Rajiv Gandhi did?3. Should the whole of America feel sorry for the massive blow to world economy due to / triggered by Lehman brothers and their banking system?4. So often in India happens that siding, giving benefits with the minorities is considered secular BUT even speaking for Hindus is anti - secular. So, should All Muslims feel sorry for what Aurangazeb did to Hindus? (Go read history)I'll tell you who should feel sorry.1. The politicians who use caste and religion as vote bank and make sure that people can never be United. Just making sure that the seed of injustice / hatred still exists.2. Those people who snatch away A DREAM because they belong to the so called'*lower caste*'. How do you even think you deserve it based on caste?! The most absurd thing. Even the penguins in Antarctica must be laughing their head off.3. Those people who don't work hard BUT demand.Yes, that's like virtual begging. Meh, that's begging.4. Those who scream out for equality and demand for special benefits for themselves! Just hear yourself!5. So, If anyone should feel bad are those undeserving candidates sitting in colleges who haven't worked hard and snatched away the dream of the hardworking candidate.The person sitting in offices and earning while the hardworking meritorious candidate is out on streets.Everytime you use your caste card- YOU SNATCH A DREAM!Let go! Get sense! If you keep a track of history and calculate it's doing no good to anyone, just harm.We have more important issues at hand, caste not being even on list.Just remember, when you use caste card, you snatch...A dream.
