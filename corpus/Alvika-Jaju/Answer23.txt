 Okay! Lemme see... would I mind it? Emm emm emm...NO! I'd love it! :D 1. He cares how I look. Unless guys are fashion designers it's usually tough for them...I would highly appreciate it.2. If a dress is too revealing and he asks me to cover it. I'll feel he wants that only he gets to see the detailed stuff. Which I feel is absolutely adorable and loving. He doesn't want to risk a dirty eye on me. I'll just fall hopelessly more in love with him.3. If he asks me to dress in a certain way with his parents. I'll feel honoured and be in love more! Because he is saying so so that his parents like me, the relationship between his parents and me stays good. His parents would be equally important to me. I'd love to respect their wishes and family culture.It will mean he feels me as his better half and sees his future with me: Bliss! Feeling stronger and more loved.Nobody in today's world would ask to wear only saree and hide face with the cloth till the neck. So if and when my man would suggest me some dresses I would love it.Edit:If I happen to visit villages then yes, I would follow family tradition. Because even now (I'm unmarried ) I still do follow family traditions and while in a village I dont wear jeans and tees.*sigh* the question mentions boyfriend! Nobody chooses a person like: Before: Mini skirt.After: Wear sarees only.The former go with former girls, latter with latter.On a point raised: Wouldn't I choose and vice versa someone who knows that I'm inbetween completely open person and conservative. Broad minded yes.I'm not a 24*7 saree person but I'm not a mini skirt person either.Why would I choose a Hitler who selects dresses like Koreans choose haircuts if I'm not a Nazi.
