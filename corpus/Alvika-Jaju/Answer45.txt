 NOTHING. AND TRUST HER.Because she's with you. She loves YOU. SHE loves to be in love with YOU! She trusts you. And knows you trust her.If you feel like telling her that you don't like the ex msging, tell her. She'll probably like it.If you feel possessive, show it, she'll love it. Just tell her you love her. I don't think she'll go back. No girl in her right mind would go back.Also are you sure that he's trying to get her back? Do you know what they spoke about? Find out first if you haven't. Maybe it's some rubbish. Maybe he was apologizing crap. Am she told him to go away. If she does go back...you deserve better. And by if she does means if she explicitly tells you " I want to go to him (read as I want to go do that same mistake). Until then keep that nonsense ex out of your lives.
