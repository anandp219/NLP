 To love feels exhilarating, calm!Peaceful and excitement!It's like opening your heart,mind and soul to the person, giving him every power to hurt you to death and trusting him enough that he won't!It's like "okay! This person annoys me to insanity and I still want him!"It's like "Anybody who hurts him/her/them WILL FACE MY WRATH!"It's feels happy being with them. Because THEY MATTER. It doesn't always feel rosey and shiny BUT normalcy is good with them.Trust! Trust that despite having hormones that go wacky, they wouldn't stare at opposite gender or cross tge line. (checking out is normal. Staring no.) It feels great doing things for them. Seeing a smile.Love is accepting! Forgiving! Loyalty!It makes you feel motivated to do better because it can fulfill your loved ones wishes.Love is wanting! Yes, wanting to be with them. Wanting them in your life. -that let's see how this works out, I still love you blah blah... I find it rubbish. It's like loving the chocolate till it lasts then just forgetting it.Love is when you feel like praying for them.It feels like " Let what may come. I will stand by him/her/them".
