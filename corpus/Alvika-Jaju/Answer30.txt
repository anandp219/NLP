 1. Take some wheat flour. Make a thick paste. If you find turmeric add a pinch. Apply on the area let it dry a bit then rub it. Keep rubbing it till you get those rolls. (Not a very good sight).This is a long term process. So might take months to couple of years maybe.The wheat germ helps in reducing the hair growth.2. As many suggested to get waxed. Get waxing done during your periods. Hormonal changes take place during then. So gradually the hair growth gets drastically reduced. This works faster than wheat.I was hairy as a teen on my arms and legs. I try to get waxing done during my periods the pain is also felt less and my body hair have considerably reduced. So it should work on chest hair too.3. I've heard that (NOT TRIED) apply some lemon juice on the area and sit in the sun for a while. This is natural bleaching.These are my suggestions. Upto you to use them.Don't worry. I understand teenage is when looks matter like life. But believe me, you are much more than that! Accept yourself.love yourself. Keep smiling.
