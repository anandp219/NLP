 I'll help you solve it better (I'll try).It's okay! It's okay not to have passion for yor husband as long you care for him, his feelings matter to you, his likes dislikes matter to you, you feel good being with him, you feel secured with him. As long as both of you talk even one sentence to a paragraph a day.Passion after a while may fade away whereas care and love grows.Oh btw the more the passion love also sometimes leads to equally passionate fights. So that's one bright side you can see. ;)And even if there aren't these right now, give it time. Like a plant every relationship needs time and patience along with forgiveness, care, and love.Relationship mein pyaar hona chaiye, passion toh fruit bhi hota hai ;) :P (It was an old joke style)
