 I was so close to getting exhausted with things mounting in my mind.I was losing desire to eat, taste (I'm a foodie so you can imagine), my energy to just sit and work hard was depleting.The thought of living 40-45 more years felt so heavy! Ah!Then my loved ones told me "I love you! Love you so much!"God, my Sai, in his own ways held me.My brother hugged me. My mother kissed me. My father put his hand on my hand and smiled.And I realised I've got to live. I've got to work hard. The problems were in my mind. The love around me was real. They don't know what they did... yes, they made me come alive.I desire to be a better person, to love more, to bring on a stranger's face a smile EVERYDAY! Literally.This is my list few one. Choose anyone.To help people.To fulfill their dreams and in those moments share their joy!To make all of them proud.To eat every type of chocolate in the world!To get fitter.To travel.To learn a few things.To marry and have kids.To tell my loved ones that i love them.Meet Robert Downey Jr. , Arjun Kapoor / Ranvir Singh / Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachan. :D
