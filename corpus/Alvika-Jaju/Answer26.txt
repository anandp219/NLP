 Thanks for A2A Angara Sreeniketh.A very interesting question.On critical thinking... what I feel is that,1. We were ruled by British. We first awed them. Then were made to awe them.Kings and people wanted to ape them in dress, food everything. Some were forced. Bottom line we awed them.2. Then we had to strive hard to survive. We saw that fame is an end product of power. See, how that effects the psychology?We like fame. Fame ~= recognition.3. The west was flourishing. West had glamour, richness, and power. It was being recognised! That were the beginning after the world of super rule by British and others and more importantly the world war 2.We got used to aping.We saw them being recognised. We wanted that.Eg: A flourishes and gets recognised.B awes A. Next response of B? I TOO WANT IT! LET ME RECOGNISE MYSELF AND WANT C TO RECOGNISE ME TOO.4. As a developing country we are constantly striving extra hard to improve. Which requires analysis, which leads to estimation and then recognising the result.Leading to self recognising and it's importance.5. Who doesn't love responses. I do.And it means a LOT for me to being responded.Response is similar to being recognised. Recognised as a person or for something you did.I love being showered with appreciation, response to me (my work personal / professional. No response, I dislike and gradually lose interest in doing it for the Co. Or people). I love knowing that what i did meant something to someone or someones isn't that why we do it? If the people or Co. Doesn't respond I feel like they didn't bother even looking at it or it didn't matter to them. Don't we remember things which matter to us. Simple logic.Nation is a cluster of many 'I's. ;)
