 Let's analysis human mind.A Bengali person (guy / girl) may find another Bengali more attractive for a simple reason that they associate themselves more with them. What actually attracts is Similar thought process, compatibility and other features depending upon person to person. I'm a marwari, born and brought up in Vizag, Andhra Pradesh. I'm definitely not as open as generally North Indians are, I'm more spiritual, I prefer South Indian food, I've ALL South Indian friends and I find South Indian guys more attractive. I feel my roots are in Rajasthan and I'm proud of it as well as I love my Andhra and everyone says "I'm more a Southie " and I'm proud of that too.Marwari guys- Eeeuuukkk, no offence but so so so I dislike.Yes, it does create ruffles at home from marriage perspectives. My parents show me marwari prospective guys and all I feel is "eh! Eeeuuu." Having said all of that, it really doesn't matter who, what, where the person is from because bottom line is WE ARE ALL HUMANS.Love is beyond borders, colour, race, caste and gender.
