 I feel bad for:1. Modi, no matter how much good he wants to do, he will have to do the dirty work of letting reservations be.2. I feel disgusted and sympathetic to all the people who *USE* reservations.And I just believe more in the fact that no matter how good you are, you may be the the prime minister of a powerful nation like India but you will bend in to absurd stuff and bend to people just because of their caste.*talk about pseudo - equality.*And thereby people like you and me (OCs) should just be glad we don't need to slave to them. YES! I'm an OC and I've worked my way up wayyyy harder! - on behalf of OCs.P.S: haters avoid commenting. Ugh, I'm not *eligible* to reply to reserved category and therefore will have to ignore.I love my Alma mater ICAI for this! It's beautiful! Only the meritorious qualify let alone getting a seat to write an exam.I *heart* ICAI! :)
