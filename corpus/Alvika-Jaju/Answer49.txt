 Thanks for A2A. I'm really sorry for what happened. I understand it hurts like crazy.You invite me to your party. I say NO.Then I invite you to my party. You say YES. You were having a really good time at my party. Then in the middle of the party I ask you to leave! Point blank leave! Because I want to invite a person. And I tell you to shoo go away.Would you still be my friend and stay at my party?Or respect yourself enough and leave?Even if you stay back... you're a pain, you'd realise it. You'd be comprising on your self respect, you'd slowly internally feel horrible. Would at all stay somewhere where you're SO UNWANTED?I guess not. Because you in your heart know you're worth more! Worth somebody who'll whole heartedly love you, WANT you, cherish you!Get up. Get ready. Go out, have an ice cream or chocolate (No alcohol please, I want you to do with with full consciousness and will power). You're free! Spend that love you have inside on yourself. You have a life... choose to make it better. P.S. don't think about her coming back. I pity the guy with whom she went with. Today she left you for someone else. Tomorrow she may leave him from someone else! I would go to the extent, pardon me as I seldom say this, don't accept her back. Someone who treated you like garbage / time pass...don't make the same mistake twice.
