 No.If apples and oranges were the same. They wouldn't be called apples and oranges.There are something men are better at and some women. I embrace that fact.These are some qualities, not that all men and women can be categorised such.1.Men are much more physically stronger and in some areas even mentally too!Women are much more caring and can express out love, care more easily. 2.Men are more analytical.Women more intuitional or say emotional.3. When it comes to being determined my vote goes to women. 4. Fighting for love?- women. Fighting for a job? - Men.5. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.6. Women can love with all her heart, and if things turn around can kick you out of her life too. (She may internally die of it, but if a guy hurts her, she will kick him)Men find it easier to move on, forgive and accept.7. Women are more calm in panic mode concerning their loved ones.Men usually freak out. :PHardwork probably nowadays it's become equal as both help each other in career as well as home.And DO NOT get me wrong. They both deserve equal respect and care. If a student is better in Maths and other in Science. Doesn't mean one is better than other. Same analogy. :)
