 In order of priority:1. Honesty! THE MOST IMPORTANT. No bending of truth with me. I cannot tolerate dishonesty.2. Respect for my family and me! MOST IMPORTANT3. Strength of Character: how much can I trust him especially w.r.t. to opposite sex. DEAL MAKER or BRAKER. If I lose trust in somebody, I cannot help but walk away. So never hurt me or anyone in such a way.4. His family: I'm an Indian. In future I will be living with his family.5. Humour! Forgiving and understanding: essential. I make mistakes, I know that. If he can forgive me then all my love is for him.And I cannot live in an extremely conservative environment. I can't be expected to not go to office, do all household chores, perform everything to the T, change my dressing to proper saree, salwar *only* stuff. I'm human, I've a career and modern day career requires today's clothes.That's about it. Short and simple.
