 Disclaimer: Harsh answer ahead.If you do not want to ruin your friendship. 1. Make sure the girl is open to you being more than just a friend.2. Understand her. If she looks for long term committed relationship or 'let's try it out' types. See what you want and then think further.3. Do NOT make it a silly thing. Respect your feelings and if you are expressing them respect hers.Respect both of you and make it a one to one affair, since you're not sure. Don't go open and then laugh it off.All the above are suggestions which I think would protect your friendship. Personally if a guy comes up to me and expresses out, I'll calmly and with respect be clear as what my view is.The don'ts to protect friendship. But if a guy expresses, forces- NOT happening.Gives me attitude (eg: Hey, if I find someone I'll go *in tone*) = Sure, go ahead. I can't stop you, I won't stop you. If I'm not interested in you, why would I. Tells me he's interested and then says haha, I'm kidding. That's the most weird thing that could happen. Because that'll make me think he's hurt. And I'll feel bad about it. Or just a sensitive thing, he joked about? Am I a joke? Or why did he joke about his own feelings. I won't like it.If you're not serious, just want a girlfriend types. And she is. - She might feel objectified (for lack of a better word). (That's the worst case- leading to friendship ruined). So calmly go ahead, say it in a manner of suggestion, and you should probably be fine.
