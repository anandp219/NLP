 *Sigh* okay! I'll let out the secret! Far across and high up in the green snowy mountains is an exotic flower which gives out a special potion. People who want to become gay, go and have that exotic potion. Mind you! It blooms once every 5 years!The SAME WAY A PERSON BECOMES STRAIGHT! Holy god!One doesn't 'become' gay. They are *just* gay. Born one. And probably a surprise, Viola! They are just normal people like others.Like you are straight. The man across the street is a bisexual. The lady next door is a lesbian. Oh and the person you see on your way out is a transgender!
