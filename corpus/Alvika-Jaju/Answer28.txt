 When my guy will talk about 'gross' stuff in front of me... I'd find him adorable! I may even compete with him at being messy! (Done that with friends and crush)Peeing in a hole? :( I'm a girl. I can't... grumble grumble.) Though I have aimed to spit with all the force from my lungs...Does that count? :PIf he talks such stuff I see and feel that he has reached a comfort level with me. And NO I don't find it gross. I FIND IT ATTRACTIVE! VERY ATTRACTIVE! and makes me feel comfortable too and be myself! (I AM VERY MESSY!- my room is mostly like been visited by a gush of wind messing everything)Being absolutely groomed and clean all the time is (according to me) isnt' a true sort of (I know that mess is human) and kind of less normal human? (for lack of word)P.S- Not in the first talk start talking about peeing. It's about gradually.Personal hygiene is umm something a friend doesn't need to share. For a friend it's off limits.I've a brother and cousins most (all excepting 2) being brothers so... potty jokes, burp jokes, girl jokes, messy stuff it is most normal!
