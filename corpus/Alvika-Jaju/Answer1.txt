 In ranks.1. Human mind : So so very complex! I connect 10 random things in a fraction of second and say something and the person in front "where did this come from?"*sigh* if I'd tell you, you wouldn't believe it.It's sometimes simple to decide where to invest and equally hard to choose my ice cream flavour and yet! I always end up taking chocolate after pondering a looooong time over all flavours.2. A woman's heart : She can share everything but not her body, partner or heart.Patience at its highest and anger as her volcano too. Unending energy despite having been on her toes the entire day...just for her loved ones. (My mom)Hurt a woman and she'll endure it for all the love she has till she knows you love her and won't betray her.She can sacrifice her life for her loved ones!When she loves...she puts her all in it.Never take it for granted or push her because she asked for something.3. Teenager's hormones : maybe its pretty simple. Boobs/chest: hard/ wet, Ass: hard/wet. Is it love? Is it crush? Is her or her or the other girl on second row? Maybe it's the yesterday girl I'm in love with- gotta find her name! :P4. Calculus and duckworth Lewis method: personal opinion! Why! Why! Why!5. I've always wondered hen or egg...which came first. But more importantly WHY IS THERE NO MENTION OF A COCK!
