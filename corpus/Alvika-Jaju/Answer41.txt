 About the fights, a straight line of heart rate means dead. Similarly ups and downs are part and parcel. Forgive him and yourself. Sometimes they bring people closer.1. How would you like to talk? During the day? During night? During day and night?! It's not possible to talk all the time. Plus doing that will leave nothing to talk about anymore.2. Some Space is good! Both of you are individuals. You need time together as well as time away too.In sugary way "let him miss you. Let yourself miss him". :)3. Umm... We do need to do our works right? If he's at work he needs to focus. If he takes break and does something else it's good. It's but natural that he will want to spend time with his friends, colleagues and alone. Please respect that.4. When he will want to spend time with his family and friends appreciate and respect that. It's his unwinding time. :)5. Maybe he talks to you at night because he is all free and relaxed then.And whenever you feel like talking just talk to him (a friend said this to his gilr, to talk whenever she feels like and needn't wait for him).When he wants to talk to you and he can, he will talk or msg... enjoy that.Keep smiling. :)
