 Thanks for A2A.Disclaimer : I'm not married. But I've seen people and have a fair idea.1. Marriage isn't a product to change. It's a commitment for life. A promise to stand by each other no matter what.2. You say that your husband and in laws are good. What more do you want.3. Spark? Spark anywhere always fades away that's why it's called spark.Trust, care, forgiveness, understanding, respect... These are rare and essential.4. Nothing and nobody is perfect. Nor you or me or neighbour. See the good accept the bad.5. Like all good things... relationship need time and building. It doesn't happen in a day.I humbly request you to spend time with your family. Don't throw it away. Good people are rare. Enjoy doing things together.Share your feelings.Give them a chance and God's grace everything will be fine.Happiness lies within you, in your own hands.
