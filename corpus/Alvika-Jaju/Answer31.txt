Holding hands, hugs, kisses, games (I like that)Pulling leg (personal choice)And romance...who doesn't love that!Oh! And be ready for some geeky romantic lines! Eg: Oh you're eyes are deeper than the Audit and Law.Oh you're humour is funnier than chapter 6A deductions.Oh I'm lost in your eyes more than I am while reading assessment procedures.Just the dates should NOT be in the months of May, July, September, October and for a few in November. You never ever ever ask a CA for a date in those months! Because we'll just bring you and date to office or bring the office to you on the date! ;)
