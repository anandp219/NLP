BH: Will I ever be able to love again?M: that'll be your choice to make! To yourself love again or not.BH: But it's so scary! *sob sob*M: Yes, it is. But probably love will be worth it. *pat* for now just calm down. You'll be alright. BH: I don't ever ever ever want to be in love again. *sob sob*M: okay. We'll see about that later. If you say you don't want to. We'll not.BH: Hmm... If only someone comes with whom I feel secure, who makes me feel loved and special, with whom I'll feel I (heart) is safe, I'll go to him / her.M: Okay. That will be rare! Most will not be like that.BH: That's alright. I'm broken. I'll be joining myself piece by piece again. Someone who can love me as I love myself, I'll go with him / her. And I'll love him / her too. M: Good girl/boy heart! I think you've made a right decision. Now, calm down, have some water, join back stronger and fill yourself with love. :)
