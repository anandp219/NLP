 I've failed many a times personally and professionally! I do have responsibilities too waiting for me. I feel terrible about personal failures, just terrible. 1. I'm trying hard to study for my exams. Books don't seem to end.2. I'm unceasingly trying to find a job.And being out of my desired location it's tough (only god knows whats happened to Video conferencing interviews).3. I get disappointed. I'm trying hard to keep people happy. Other than my parents none understand what I'm feeling. And they too know only partially. I've to be strong in front of people, IT'S JUST SO TOUGH!I don't express sometimes for the fear of being misunderstood.4. My grandma is suffering from Cancer and probably won't survive through it, and I can't spend time with her.5. I have expectations from myself and ones I have to live upto.There are days I wake up feeling "another battle day" and gather hope to live through it. Put a tired forced smile. Just the other day I was telling my mom "If I am to die now, I wouldn't stop it. I'd have unfinished works and regrets but I wouldn't stop it. I'd welcome it".I know that's not the solution.1. I wake up gather my hope, courage and faith that it'll be a good to managable day.2. I feel happy when my loved ones are happy.My little brother is my bundle of joy.Support from my family and friends.Most importantly, God. I believe in Sai baba. He's there taking care of me.3. I feel happy when they tell me they *love me*.4. I feel happy seeing and hearing them.5. I feel happy when I successfully solve questions in test.I sleep with a hope and pray to god. I believe in God. I believe in my strength. I believe in my loved ones. And hopefully tomorrow will be a better day.From shawshank redemption "Hope is a good thing. Probably the best of all things".
