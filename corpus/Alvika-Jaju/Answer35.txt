 Applicable to men and women. :)1. Forgiveness - This quality is highly underrated. Forgiveness towards others and self too!2. Desirous and satisfied- Too contradicting? I could never be with a man who can't desire. I don't mean psychotic/ greedy desire. But yes, desire and work for it.Eg: desire a job / hobby / a person. And want them in his life. I was once asked out by a guy and he was like "I like, admire etc etc you. But mine is selfless love. If you stay with me, good else also its fine."Now that is a love I DON'T want or respect. Desire to achieve targets but not achieving them shouldn't let you get bogged down and beat yourself hard. Be satisfied that you tried. Be satisfied because this isn't the end of the world.3. Humour and wit- Believe me, life is tough. This helps through! :)4. Respect and consideration - Give respect to everyone! Irrespective of age, gender, race or even species. 5. Intelligence, wisdom.
