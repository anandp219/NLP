 There is a man I know. He is so committed to his woman like no other man ever has, ever will be!His woman was extremely beautiful in her youth but age spares none, pregnancy, child birth and stress... she is still beautiful but to him she is most beautiful, and he says it.When she is sick, he gets worried sick! Treats her like his baby, wakes up like 10 times in the night to check her temperature, see if she is sleeping fine.He doesn't remember her cards. Once she gifted him a card made by her 5 years back and he happily received it without realising it was an old one. We had a hearty laugh.He loves her like crazy. They are opposite like poles and similar like two coins. When she needs him, he leaves everything, literally for her.He cannot tolerate anything against her. Not even his own children or parents. He says "she is my wife. I can say things rude to her. I shall not like if anyone else does".He doesn't / hasn't looked at other women in the 'other' way ever! I know for sure because I'm an adult. I've seen his acquaintances flirt, so far as getting touching and sleeping with other women. I know that another man like him cannot exist. He teases her, pulls her leg, respects her. The way he cares and loves her NO MAN CAN EVER EVER EVER LOVE SOMEONE SO MUCH. He loves to make her laugh.He scolds her when she doesn't take care of herself. He corrects her when she is wrong.He makes her laugh when she is sad. He is the pillar she can always fall on.He reminds her to take her Blood pressure medicines everyday!She (apart from his daughter and son) are the only ones who can budge him from his decisions. He is the man, I'm blessed to call my Father.
