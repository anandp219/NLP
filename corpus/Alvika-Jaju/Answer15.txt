 I'm no expert. I'm not married.- Disclaimer.What I do know is that when we love someone we don't put a clause, do we? That so and so should do this or that.We just love and express it in our own ways some by writing letters, poems some by in their little and big gestures like taking out time amidst hectic work schedule, just saying I love you, helping etc.I'm sure he must have expressed in some ways.Then due to work load or stress these might come down. But you both are there together, love each other and that matters.Coming to your solution: It's very very simple! Don't worry. 1.Just let go. Accept what happened and start afresh. 2. You love him. So go express your love. Celebrate his birthday. Love is NOT a business deal to be equal. Do whatever you feel like doing irrespective of what he did for your birthday because you love doing things for him and that makes you happpy (let go of being selfish and you'll feel how wonderful itll be).Celebrate being together.You're lucky to be with the one you love. Cherish it.
