 1. Ask him about it. If you don't you'll eventually lose the trust in him and THAT is the end.2. If he says he was kidding, see if you can believe him. I wouldn't but then that's me, if he is such types as *be as the other guys when in their Co. * it just shows he's a weak personality. I can't be with weaklings in this regard.If he admits it, move on. A man who has no control over his emotions let alone physical, isn't worth being with.The strength of character makes a person. If that is lost...everything is lost. Don't feel sorry for yourself. You didn't do anything wrong. Walk away.
