 I'm not a mother but I'm a child (well at least to my grandparents :P). Let me say these,1. Grandparents play a unique role in a child's life. Do you remember how when mom, dad refused to give you something or you were upset, you went to your grandparents? Well most children do. 2. Grandparents help keep the family together.3. All set and done, they have given Birth and brought up your husband. They deserve all the respect, love and care. They have a right on your child.4. The stories, pampering, love, culture and the WISDOM from grandparents is something your child deserves and is very important.5. From the point of view of grandparents, grandparents dote on their grandchildren. Their bond is special. They enjoy time with them.Eg: I've taught my grandma what's app. She enjoys what's app and Google! She downloads god pictures and shares them. And sitting beside her is treat! She excitedly shows me what she downloaded! And gets disappointed when the download option isn't there. She teaches me cooking. Scolds me when I'm lazy. She guide me. She always tells me to be positive, believe in God, work hard and be a good person. She is the most wonderful person in the world! Might I mention she is more broad minded than my mother! :D :PI love listening to her, my love for mythology is from her, she is like an ocean of wisdom and knowledge. My late grandfather, the best grandfather in the world. Every exam till he was well, he came to pick me up leaving office. Read me tintin comics etc. I miss him. Saying all of that, DO NOT make your in laws a baby sitter. I've seen people do that and that's just awful. Let their time together be of joy, fun, stories, food (grandma's food is always the best!) and love.
