 I am a person who gets bored very fast (not easily but fast)! Before you can say bo-red, I'm already bored with what interested me. It's more like curse.If I feel I've read about this topic sufficient enough... I'm bored.I'm an extremely curious person! Eg: I've questioned the salary of people (that curious and umm shamless).Why I was put in BCC of a mail.Why we celebrated April fool's day.I analyse behaviour of people and refrain myself from doing it too much (I have my reasons).So sequence is... I'm curious, I detail / question it, struggle to understand it, done. What do I do?I shift! I shift to anything else.The topic can be ANYTHING! NOT EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE TO MY STUDY, WORK, LIVING. Sometimes it's tough finding something new and that makes me sad, then I take what's available.In all of that I feel what kindles curiosity is that something new and desire to learn which comes from within. To rekindle it... start with what you love, observe what's around you. It could be a packet of snacks or the no. Of moons on Saturn.
