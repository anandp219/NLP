 Yes! Being loved is so precious! Love me more than I love you... it'll automatically make me love you more because I see how much you love, care and want me. Love me but treat me carelessly or shoo me aside too many times (not counting if you're genuinely busy with work or any reason, would prefer being told) or if the person doenst love me much, doesnt open or share / is cold. My love won't come down but it might make feel I'm not loved or wanted either. it'll be hard for me to express love, open up.Now, if someone thinks like I do. Yes, loving them or being loved more is fine.What's good? Saying "I love you". yes, out of the blue 'I love you' are the best! Combine it with a kiss it only gets better.A msg, a call, come home early to say so. Yes, that's loving. And that's great! It's the little things in life that make the difference! :)
