 From a girl! 3 steps. Yes it's that simple. :)1. Just give responses and be honest!: She did something for you RESPOND. LET HER KNOW IF YOU LIKE IT OR YOU DIDN'T...whichever it is.2. Let her know you love her. Just say "I love you!" "You mean the world to me" Thank you. Etc... These little things we LOVE IT.3. Let her know you remembered her in ANY WAY. Your choice. A simple msg of how are you is good enough. WE ARE NOT GOD TO KNOW IT.That's it! It's not nuclear science. For those who find it difficult to even do this... get a dog. It'll lick you even when you forget the creature.
