 Don't! Just don't.1. If you don't know what to do with your life, that's your issue. Obviously you'll figure something out.2. Even if you're not able to figure out what to do, will you stop living? Will you not earn for yourself? Will you just sit there and do nothing?You can be honest with her and tell her your feelings and worries.3. She can choose to walk away and maybe find someone more stable.OrShe can choose to be with you, love you, spend her life with you, should you want her with you too.4. Seriously, what type of girl is she in today's world where girls are earning themselves and aren't dependent on the guy. So stop thinking she is financially dependent on you. If she chooses to support you morally or in anyway she can, take how much you can without hurting your self respect.5. These excuses "my future" what will "her future with me..." don't do that. If you love her- fight for her, keep her.If you don't love / value her or her love- let go of her.In that case let her be with a man who does.Believe me good man, finance may come and go, what to do in life will sometime or other get sorted out but love is seldom to rare to sometimes never found. You have it, value it...before its too late.Lucky are the people who are in love and blessed are those who are loved back.
