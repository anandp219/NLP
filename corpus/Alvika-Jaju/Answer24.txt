 In the simplest and rawest example I can give.1. Hitler was great. I don't think he was happy (he committed suicide). One of the Greatest men in history.2. A baby is happy. He is in no way great! His eyes, smile, laugh, cheeks, body language is all happiness... just pure happiness.3. Most important story! Alexander the great! And yet when he died he spread the msg:1. I own wealth of the world... I carry none to my grave.2. No doctor could save my life.Having said that (ponder over that) why can't you have both. Share your greatness, share what you have and I think you'll be happy. Be happy in what you do, whatever you do... and see greatness will come to you.Funny part? Greatness might lead to greed.Happiness leads to sharing and leads to more happiness.I was commuting the other day, the traffic was moving slow. There was a little girl learning to sew clothes. I leaned over from my vehicle and by action expressed out "wow. Very beautiful!" YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE SMILE SHE HAD!It made my day! I made someone smile! That's my super power... and thanks to God, that makes me great! And wow! Happy too!Incident 2: I am blessed to be financially decent. Im not rich. But relative to a beggar I have more. Here my greatness lies in money in my purse.While walking I saw a beggar, stopped, bought him a meal and water, washed his hands, opened the food packet and served him.Toothless smile on a dirt face. Believe me... it was PRICELESS! I felt happy!Bottom line: I'd choose happiness any day! I'd rather be happy till I die than be great! Unless the greatness can be shared and make me happy.
