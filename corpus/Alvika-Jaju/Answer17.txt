 Thanks for A2A.Of course I'll judge you! (FYI I never do that but here is an exception).You say you want a virgin wife but you're not a virgin. How convinient! And this is why indian society has chutzpahs.Just imagine this on a larger scale: if every guy wasn't a virgin but wanted a virgin wife... he'd be left unmarried because in India girl boy ratio 1991 census 933:1000 approx.So great going. Keep guys banging and find a girl from another planet.So CAN YOU SEE HOW ABSURD THAT WOULD BE!Be quiet and read on Mr.non virgin-wanting-a-Ms.virgin.1. If you're scared about if it's be equally or less or more special /good for her...let me tell you this second hand from my friends who have had premartial sex."It is great! Because here it is blessed with the vows of marriage!" And for a girl that matters the MOST! Because whatever was in the past is gone wooshhh and doesn't matter.A very lovely line by Vishnu Komma "The problems of your past are your business.The problems of your future are my privilege". Beautiful lines...say it and see how she respects and loves you. So yeah ideally you shouldn't ask. But dick heads will be dickheads <Ifyouseewhatididthere>.Ask her directly but gently.You might see her first sex time blood or you may not. Girls don't bleed like river. Some get it more on the sheet, some while they pee after sex and some don't bleed enough to get noticed.You might go in for "so is the seal intact?""Is the warranty void?""Is the profit holding up or leaked out the loss?""Has the shield protection been avenged?""Is the apple eaten?"Akkk! Gotta go vomit due to the question I read.Somebody get me an Aspirin! And this guy a slap of sense.
