 I took a negotiations class around this topic once and I will try to bring ideas from that and other sources. First, a protest needs to have an objective. What outcome do you want out of the protest? That objective forms the end condition for the protest. "I would stop protesting, if I get X." This X must be spelled out clearly. For instance, when Airtel tried to break net neutrality we protested with the objective - "remove the recent VoIP tariffs". Without a concrete objective for a protest, it is running like an headless chicken.Second, the objective needs to be reasonable. If you had a child who is protesting to get a new car, you might not be able to do much. If the protest is for an extra candy or a book, maybe it could be considered. Third, a protest needs an organization. Who are the other people who are also looking for the objective? The bigger the objective, the bigger is the need for a large organization. At this point it becomes politics. There is nothing wrong with that. There is no way to achieve something without an organization. Is there an existing organization?Fourth, you need to pursue alternative ways of conflict resolution. Are there ways you can get close to the objective without a major protest? Are there ways to avoid confrontation? For instance, if I were a kid who wants a book, I might tell my dad that I will forgo candy for the next week. Show your key strengths and the ways in which you get the job done.If you cannot resolve the conflict way with talk, then get on the actual confrontation. It starts with conveying your message clearly. People cannot read your mind. Take the message to as many people. If the objective is reasonable many would share. Explore solutions that could get you to the objective. If you believe in the cause, pursue this relentlessly.
