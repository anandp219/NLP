 India is a perfectly fine "Indian" name and a beautiful name too. India is from the Sanskrit word Sindhu around which we had the best of our civilizations. This way we are direct inheritors of the Indus Valley Civilization. India/Sindhu was also the name used in most of the historical works about India - written by the Greeks, Chinese, Arabs and others. And the connotation is almost always positive. India is also the root word for other places like Indonesia with which it shared a long history. It is those collective Indies that European explorers sought long to find new routes for & change history.If you think India is not a good name for us along with Bharat, you probably don't appreciate our history and its deep connections with other civilizations. We don't need to change our name just to satisfy the inferiority complex of a few. Rather we should get them to feel comfortable under our skin.India is a beautiful name that captures the diversity of our history better than Bharat. I love Bharat too especially in context of the Hindu scriptures. And having two names - one for the outside and one for the inside - is beautiful too.
