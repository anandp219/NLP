 Apart from Mahatma Gandhi and Morarji Desai that Nagarajan Srinivas has already mentioned, there is Sardar Patel, C. Rajagopalachari, Netaji Bose, Vivekananda, the historian R. C. Majumdar who are respected by people of all political inclinations. A sizable body of the Constituent Assembly who wrote our Constitution were from the right wing. Again, some of these were right wing on religion only (Bose) and some were right on both religion & economics (Rajaji and Patel). In the present day again we have one group that is primarily right on religion, but left on economics (the Sangh parivar & a lot of BJP), one group that is right on economics, but not as much on religion (the Swarajya group, the economists Jagdish Bhagwati, Aravinda Panagariya, Gurucharan Das & Ashok Desai) and the rest who are right on both aspects (one faction of BJP such as Arun Shourie). Traditionally, across the world right wing is short in academia. As the old saying goes, the left wingers with brains become professors and the right wingers with brains become entrepreneurs. The right wing is thus still short of more intellectuals, but the tide seems to be turning.
