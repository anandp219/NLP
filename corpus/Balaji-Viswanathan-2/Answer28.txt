 Gupta empire is the longest of major Indian empires extending for nearly three centuries. Mauryan empire lasted about 150 years; Mughal and British Raj each lasted slightly less than 200 years each. It had among the strongest of militaries and most efficient of administration among any Indian empire.It is in Gupta dynasty in which India had some of its greatest achievements. From chess to sex (kamasutra), from zero to Shakuntala, from Panchatantra to ayurvedha, the key elements that defined Indian history were made then. Aryabhatta developed 0 and the number system in this period. Varahamihira built the greatest works on Indian astronomy. Kamasutra was written by Vatsayana, Kalidasa brought the greatest of Indian drama that impacts Indian art to this day while Vishnu Sharma's Panchatantra stories entertain Indian kids to this day. In visual arts, we see stunning elements of Gupta art in UNESCO world heritage sites such as the Ajanta & Ellora caves [part of the caves were developed in Satvahana period though]. Sushruta brought some of the greatest medicinal works for his period. It was under the Gupta, Indian education went to great heights with the establishment of the Nalanda University among others. It is fascinating to see that even after 1500 years their works are as good as new to us. We are continued to be fascinated by Shakuntala, Chess, zero, Panchatantra and Kamasutra. And Nalanda stands as a great inspiration for what can achieve.Literature, mathematics, physics, painting, medicine and religion were all in their glorious heights, while there was social stability, peace and economic prosperity. It is easily the golden age. If I had a time machine, 400 AD Ujjain would be my destination followed by 1000 AD Thanjavur [Chola Empire].
