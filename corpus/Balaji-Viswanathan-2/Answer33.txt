 It was a marriage of convenience primarily connected by their common fear of the Soviet Union. Both hated the Communists and in the 1930s signed an anti-Comintern pact. Otherwise there was little ideology overlap as Hitler thought China to be their ally and Japan was looking at UK. As China entered into a pact with USSR, Hitler moved to Japan and as Hitler was gaining on UK, Japan wanted to pick the winning side in Europe.Later, both found US to be a huge threat and feared the entry of US against them. This moved them even closer and once US entered the war against Japan, Germany too declared war. Ultimately both fought two different wars. While we simplistically group them as WW2 just because the Allies fought both, there was not much overlap between the Pacific and the Atlantic war. They started and ended on different times, involved different motivations and strategies and didn't even share much of troops or resources due to geographical barriers.
