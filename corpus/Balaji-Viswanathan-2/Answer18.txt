 When I went to buy my first car, the dealer gave me a 0% loan for 6 years. That ensured that he got my business that day [selling the car] and for a few years to come [maintenance, supplies] and even the potential to sell the next car a few years down the road. Seller financing is a prominent business strategy where the seller closes the deal by offering sweet financing. A lot of major businesses do that. And so do many countries. Japan does that, China does that and so does India on a smaller scale [prompting questions like why India provides aid to Nepal etc].In India, Japan and China are fighting to dominate the world's hottest rail market. China was leading in the game of finishing India's first bullet train that will get a lot of publicity and copycat projects. However, China didn't finance the deal. Japan entered the market with a easy financing deal and pocketed the deal. In this, it was not really different from my car dealer who gave a 0% loan to me to pocket business from a rival.To build the bullet train, you need a lot of things. Some of them will be made in India and the rest will be made in Japan. In the contract, Japan has said that 30% of the things has to be bought from Japan. There will be a large number of exports from Japan to build the bullet train. That is a lot of jobs. Once the line is built, there will be maintenance and adding new train carriages. More exports and more jobs.The Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train is just a starting point. If this works, India will be building advanced trains all over the country. And trains are just one among dozens of new things India will make - new homes, new cities, new factories. Trillions of dollars are at stake here. Like a Venture Capitalist, Japan is trying to enter the market early and capture it before others come in. At the end of the day, it is business. Just as your shopkeeper provides you cheap loans to buy TV, phones and other appliances, countries provide you loans to buy their technology and products. Do you think the Audi dealer below is providing you charity by providing a 0% loan? No. Neither does Japan.
