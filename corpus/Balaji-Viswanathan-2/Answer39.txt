 Siddhartha was probably born in Nepal. But, Buddha was born in India ;-)That is a cheeky way of saying both nations can claim ownership of him and that the India-Nepal division didn't exist at the time of Buddha. In that sense, Buddha was like William the Conqueror who though born in what is now France is mostly associated as the King of England. Buddha was born in the capital town of the Shakya kingdom. There is no agreement on where exactly this capital was. There are 3 close towns that each claim to be the birthplace of Siddhartha and the capital of that kingdom. Two of them are in present day Nepal and one in present India. All 3 towns are along the modern India-Nepal border. ASI digs into Buddha home debate. PBS produced an award winning documentary on this topic in 2013 although it ends inconclusive. Bones of the BuddhaLumbini in Nepal is the most popular of the three. Given that Lumbini is in present Nepal, they have a part claim to his legacy. However, the prince who was born in that capital town achieved glory when he meditated under a Bodhi tree at Gaya, changed the world through his sermon at Sarnath and eventually claimed his divine abode in Kushinagar. All of these places are in present India. That means India can also claim his legacy regardless of whether Piprahwa was his birthplace or not.At the time of Buddha, the political boundaries were also different from that of today. India is a cultural union that touched almost all of the subcontinent, but the political boundaries were often different from that. Here is India at the time of Buddha and the kingdoms straddled the present day borders.
