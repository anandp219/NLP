 Would you love your friend only when he is rich or would you love him regardless of his wealth? If you are a true friend, your love will be unconditional even if you would want him to be rich and happy. Like all great human emotions, patriotism is form of Unconditional love. You love the entity itself - not just the bells and whistles that decorate it. You don't switch it off just because your nation went through a temporary hardship.Again, India is far from the world's most patriotic country. That honor usually goes to Venezuela. In Pictures: World's Most Patriotic Countries. And in India you can see a very healthy debate and arguments about government, its practices, culture etc. Calling India as ridiculously patriotic shows one's ignorance about the society.Once again, the European example of nationalism is relevant. Contrary to the claims in the question details, Europe's wars are far older than nationalism. Habsburgs and other dynasties kept fighting for things that were little to do with nationalism. On the other hand, nationalism helped fight such imperialism, feudalism, religious bigotry, racism and exploitation. Since humans form groups anyway, it is far better for that group to be an inclusive nation rather than on non-inclusive basis such as ethnicity, caste, religion, language, class etc. In India's case it was through the upsurge of nationalism that we outlawed heinous practices like untouchability & we have ways to go to convince people to stop thinking in much smaller terms like caste.Like every civilization, India has had its ups and downs. It has had its periods of glory and its periods of gloom. The past two centuries were its down time and it was not alone in this. All other ancient civilizations (Egypt, China, Iraq, Iran, Greece) too went through a down period in the modern era, while civilizations in their periphery snatched their growth baton. While the east is moving to west now, a few centuries ago the direction of migration was the other way. Life is not without its ironies. Sitting in the early 21st century, it looks like India has passed through its nadir and yet another growth cycle awaits us. It is exciting to watch a fallen warrior long kicked by others slowly getting up. Almost every action movie is made in that trope and it makes for a natural excitement. Just like the gays celebrate "gay pride" movements to mark the end of their long oppression, Indians are getting out of the metaphorical growth closet and are showing jubilation marking the end of the "long gloom". Sure, there is a long way to go, but we have come a long way and deserve this celebration.
