 I don't know the relationship between number of Americans at work in factories and India's new jobs. Here is what India's new jobs are likely to come from:In the next two decades, millions of Indians are going to climb up the poverty and would need new homes. These homes require cement, wood, copper, steel, earth movers, cranes, cement mixers. Inside these new homes, they need new refrigerators, new furniture, new clothes, new iron boxes, new fans... India has 4 times as many people as the US and most of these are going to buy stuff new.For a nation of 1.2 billion people, you need energy to support. And you no longer can rely on the simple hydro or coal. India would rapidly increase its solar power, nuclear power, wind power and so on. These would require new power stations, new turbines, new insulators, new batteries, new transformers, new power lines... India along with China, US and Europe are going to engage in a massive space race. Things are going to grow by an order of magnitude or more. New generation of satellites, launch vehicles and possibly a human colony in Mars. These require new building materials, new chips, new fuels, new engines..The 1.2 billion people who are climbing up the ladder need stuff to move. They are going to buy new cars, new metro systems, new airplanes, new buses and other transportion mechanisms. Many of this could be made in India at some point. These vehicles need new tracks, new roads, new bridges, new harbors.I could go on. You get the idea. From toys to clothes to food products, there are massive amount of stuff that need to be manufactured to fit the economics and conditions of 1,200,000,000 people. New innovation is going to spark and new types of business are going to sprout.
