 American culture seems to be more work/career centric because it was populated by successive waves of immigrants who sought a better life through work. There is self-selection here. Starting from the Puritans to the Bavarian Jews, Italians, Irish to Asians, a variety of groups came to the US to seek work & grow up the prosperity ladder. They didn't come to their promised land risking everything in their life to relax. The people who had/sought better leisure & work-life balance didn't make it through the boats. Even today US visa system is structured in a way that you have to be a career centric person to be admitted into the US. The workaholic immigrants then teach their children that they have to work hard & have a great career to be important in the society. This then continues for generations. Since people strongly believe in social mobility through work and an implicit class system based on career success is everywhere [from Wall Street to Silicon Valley] there is a strong pressure to not take even the existing vacation days.Given this cultural factor & self selection bias, Americans are less likely to have long vacation even if their employers offer them. Why would the employers then offer them if there is not much demand for that?
