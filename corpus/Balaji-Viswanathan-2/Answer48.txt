 The first migrants into India probably came about 70,000 years ago through the northern route. A lot of evidence from this genetic studies with the Haplogroup C-M130 having likely originated/developed in India and spread around the world. There is still some controversy on whether this group in south India came via the north or came via boats.This essay in Nature talks of possibilities of modern humans arriving in southern India about 75000 years ago - Human migrations: Eastern odyssey before the largest ever volcanic eruption on Earth caused by the eruption of Toba - Toba catastrophe theory. This single burst caused 6 years of global volcanic winter [very little sunlight] and nearly a 1000 years of cooling forcing the humans to migrate significantly. Some of these might have migrated through the coasts of Africa and West Asia. Coastal migrationAnother group doesn't believe humans came to India before Toba and argues that they took the land route from the north. Humans Reached South Asia After Major Eruption Neither theories are conclusive and there is a strong mixture of multiple groups in India. Only people in Andaman Nicobar islands seem to have a stronger connection to these earliest humans. Later some of these moved to Australia in various batches (Genomes link aboriginal Australians to Indians)One of the most significant discoveries for South India happened in the 2007 discovery of Jwalapuram tools [Paleolithic Tools, Jwalapuram Valley, India] that found humans tools used before 74,000 years ago and a culture that potentially survived the Toba eruption. Ancient Humans in Asia Survived Super-Eruption, Find SuggestsThe earliest humans, like humans elsewhere did various forms of hunting and gathering until agriculture spread to all of India possibly through Indus valley. We don't know very much about their history, but like the dig in Jwalapuram and elsewhere reveal, there are enormous mysteries stuck underneath.
