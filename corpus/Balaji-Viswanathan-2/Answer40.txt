 Two very different issues.In case of the Tibet dam, China was not building in any river, but one of the key water sources for India and Bangladesh. The dam is the largest in Tibet and the river serves over 100 million people. Tibet's largest hydropower station starts full operation. In a water scarce subcontinent there will ofcourse be worries when rivers crossing multiple nations are dammed this way. If the river were not a shared resource there would have been no concerns.In case of the South China sea lighthouse, the lighthouses are made over disputed reefs in an area claimed by half-dozen countries. Over $5 trillion of world shipping moves through them and no one wants a war/conflict there. China completes construction of lighthouses in disputed South China Sea. If those lighthouses were not in disputed reefs there would have been no issues.If you see these issues from the other side of the table, you can see why they can be worrisome.
