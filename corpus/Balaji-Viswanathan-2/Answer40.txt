 Given the precarious nature of the state, the also Indian government avoided confrontation to the maximum extent possible. Until things were forced on it, India usually let negotiations before war. For instance, Kashmir was not focused until Jinnah's troops started trying to take the independent state by force, forcing India to interfere. In case of Goa, once again Nehru wanted to give peace a chance before war. For years, India looked to negotiate and peaceful transfer of French Indian colonies to India in early 1950s gave hope. In 1953, Indian delegation was in Lisbon negotiating, but Salazar was adamant. Two years later, all relations between the countries broken down. India still didn't want a military operation against an European country backed by the US when the cold war started to get quite serious. When Eisenhower led Republicans to a victory in 1952, India had to be somewhat cautious. The Republicans who ruled until 1960 might not have hesitated in punitive actions against India when a NATO ally was attacked. India however pressurized through a lot of channels including the UN, NAM (Non Aligned Movement) and by backing both RSS & Gandhians in conducting people revolts. In 1954, an RSS backed group first secured Indian annexations of Dadra & Nagar Haveli. Indian annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli In December 1960, UN passed a resolution to allow colonies power to conduct their own affairs.Emboldened by the UN resolution and the election of John F Kennedy in the same period, India was building up its army in preparing for a military force. When an Indian passenger boat heading to Kochi - Sabarmati - was attacked India used that as the pretext to attack Goa. It was pretty clinical - in 2 days and for the loss of 22 soldiers, India effectively ended the Portuguese empire in the same coast where it started 500 years before.
