 I once wrote a detailed post on this topic: How did Bangalore City turn out to be the Silicon Valley of India? I will summarize the key ideas from there.Factors that helped Bengaluru become a major IT hub:The Mysore state was one of the best run princely states in India with Diwans (Prime Ministers) who put education at their top priority.

Doyens like Sir CV Raman would be its directors.Given the favorable climate, long distance from Pakistan/China [so that it doesn't get easily hit in a war] and the research core built by IISc, independent India's government built a variety of labs and institutes related to defense and space research. These attracted the best of minds to the city.In the early 1980s, Narayana Murthy & friends moved from Pune to build Infosys in the city closer to his hometown in Kolar.

In 1989, when GE's Jack Welch was in India to sell airplanes to the government, Indian government's policy guru arm-twisted him to setup an office in India as a return favor. GE found Wipro's Premji to be quite trustworthy and thus setup their shop there. In India's Outsourcing Boom, GE Played a Starring RoleOnce GE setup in Bengaluru, it got into the international business radar and a variety of companies were formed around that core.See more: How did Bangalore City turn out to be the Silicon Valley of India?
