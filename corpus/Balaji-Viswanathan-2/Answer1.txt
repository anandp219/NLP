 As others mentioned Modi has a Masters in Political Science and thus he is sure to have read Ambedkar's works. It might seem ironic and counterintuitive to some, but the sangh parivar seems to be genuinely taking into many of Ambedkar's teachings - including fighting caste. The reason is that castes & caste leaders stand in the way of RSS' consolidation of the Hindu base. And no group stands to gain from caste weakening as much as the RSS. Here is a fascinating article in The Hindu on this: Hindutva 2.0s new caste challenge. This significant pivot in the last decade is one key element in the resurgence of BJP. The pivot firmly rests on bringing minority caste in each state to power and weaken the grip of the majority castes. Thus, RSS put weight behind Modi in 2001 to weaken Patel control in Gujarat and later put weight behind Nitish Kumar [again from a minority caste] to weaken the Yadav base in Bihar. In UP they sacrificed some of their Brahmin votes to Mayawati to focus on the Dalits. In Rajasthan, they brought a non-Jat [Vasundra Raje] and in Maharashtra they brought a non-Maratha [Fadnavis] after a long time. When the Patels revolt or Shiv Sena goes berserk it is because RSS' pivot seems to be working way too well for them. RSS Wants No Bar for CastesIf you thought Modi had a thumping win merely because of his economic ideas or his social media activities, you are mistaken. There is something big going underneath.Ambedkar would not have approved RSS' methods nor does RSS accept all of Ambedkar's ideas, but there seems to be a genuine recognition of Ambedkarism in the right wing, even if only in parts. They might add him to their pantheon of outside heroes alongside Patel and Bose. For Modi and the Sangh, weakening the castes works well for their power interests because weakening castes also means weakening of many of their key opponents [caste leaders].
