 Humans grew up in groups and we are social creatures. Group loyalty is a part of our evolution and one of our survival technique. Instead of just thinking about just ourselves, we widen the circle to care for the group. Pride and loyalty are side effects of that relationship.The circles start with the family, then widens to include the tribe and then the region, language, religion, culture and so on. Until a few centuries ago, the circle had not fully widened to include nations. People still thought about their villages or regions. With better communication and transportation systems, people discovered commonalities in culture that preceded the modern incarnation of the nation. By one view, the nation is an extension of our family or tribe. Just as we feel special bonding towards our kids and immediate kin, we feel special bonds with the nation. These bonds help create the social order we live in. These bonds also help us react to problems in families that have no relationships with ours. The roots of great universities to great charity organizations lie in such bonds - often religious or nationalistic. People feel compelled to think beyond themselves and donate for the welfare of some strangers. It enables teamwork among strangers fighting for the same goal. US Army and other armies around the world could attract people who would sacrifice their own lives if needed for the community's welfare, because of this special bond.In modern corporations, we have realized the power of such bonds in enabling teamwork. We thus mimic many of the ideas that nationalists or even religious evangelists used in the past, to build team cohesion. We have team outings, team meetings, dressing around the company's logo/colors to even have songs and anthems.We feel proud because we are wired to feel special bonds with the groups we live in. Nation is just one of the dozens of groups/identities/badges we wear. Such bonds, pride and loyalty helps teamwork and social order and thus widely encouraged.
