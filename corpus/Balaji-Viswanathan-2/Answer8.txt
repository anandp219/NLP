 When India setup its first IITs it brought in other governments to help. (West) Germany helped setup IIT Madras, Soviet Union helped with IIT Bombay, UK helped with IIT Delhi and US helped with IIT Kanpur. Eventually, we got our foot in the game and now these institutes have grown in global fame.Or let's take Cricket. Think of the difference between Indian Premier League and say Ranji One Day Trophy. Which one offers more value to the spectators? India does have a lot of Cricket players, but by adding the best of the world you are both providing opportunities to young cricketers to learn best practices and at the same time offer the best value to the paying public.In the same way, the partners of Singapore, Japan and other countries would help Indian firms learn best practices and at the same time help the people get the best facilities. Naidu had limited options for his grand plans. At a time when the whole of India was pushing for more development - with large projects from Gujarat, TN, Bihar etc, Andhra was not getting sufficient funds for its massive capital. Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu's grand project of Amaravati stares at a crisis of capital even before construction unless investors line up soonInstead of empty pride, he went after global investors and Singapore firms are just one group of partners. When a 1.3 billion nation is growing, it has to take every available hand it can, rather than have egos & pride limit it to only a few companies.References:Kanpur Indo-American Programme
