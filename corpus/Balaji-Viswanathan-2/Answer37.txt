 Two years ago the media was talking about whether India was becoming the "rape capital" of the world. Now, there is very less mention of rapes. Has India suddenly become a great country for women in a matter of months?While Dadri is a terrible tragedy and we must make sure mob justice is prevented & law order handled, we must also be careful not to take media as the barometer for what is happening in the country. One swallow doesn't a summer make. If just one incident alone would make a nation go from normal state to extremist state, we must either be setting an impossibly high bar for ourselves or we are just kidding ourselves. Hate crimes happen across the world and this is why we have police and courts. If people stopped criminal activities, we would not be needing police. To objectively judge India is getting intolerant/extremist, we need to define some variables [say deaths from communal violence], take the trend over a period of time and also compare that with other nations. I have quote a few statistics here: Is India gradually becoming intolerant as claimed by the Sahitya academy winners? and it doesn't look like India is getting any more extremist. The beef issue is centuries old. Indians never really revolt. But, in 1857 they did and ended East India Company partly because they suspected there might be beef in the gun cartridges used. There was no RSS/BJP back then. Imagining that beef controversy is just specific to BJP or 2015 is being totally ignorant of Indian history. Pretending that people just started caring about it now or it is somehow related to Modi is ignorant. We have had riots for beef well before modern India, well before politics. Every culture has its own set of taboos (Why are the British revolted by the idea of horsemeat?) and not paying attention to it is not smart. Let's again put this in perspective with the rest of the world. Let's get into the concept of hate crimes - violence motivated by religion, ethnicity etc. [Violent hate crime. International Statistics]. Leave alone West Asia or Pakistan. The most peaceful Canada has 1200 hate crimes a year with 1/40 of India's population (Police-reported hate crime in Canada, 2013) and highly developed Sweden has about 6500 hate violence incidents (Record increase in Swedish hate crimes) with 1/120 of Indian population. France and Ireland have far more. India too is likely to have lakhs of such incidents every year. If you want to start counting all the ink throwing, all the harrassments in a country with 1.3 billion people - you will need a lot of fingers. Only difference is that the national media in other countries don't cover each individual hate crime in lurid detail. They focus on patterns, trends, statistics when they report crime. This is not to justify violence, but helping you understand reality. Taking a handful of crime incidents to brand India more violent than other nations is stupid. World is a violent, hate-filled place and finger pointing doesn't help change for better.In summary, it is an unfortunate incident and a crime. We must look to solve them. However, let us also not exaggerate one incident and take it to label a whole nation. If we do that, we could put any label on any community.
