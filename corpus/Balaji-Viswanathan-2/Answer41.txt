 The Constitution also doesn't say how we should we punish murder or that we conduct Parliamentary proceedings in Sansad Bhavan. The Constitution is not an exhaustive collection of all the things government has to do. It is just a formal framework that defines the state. The details are left to various law codes (like IPC), acts of the government and plain tradition. We have had a variety of debates on whether Constitution defines Mahatma Gandhi as the father of nation or that hockey is the national game. I find those silly because it ignores the power of tradition in any system. Unless the Constitution explicitly prohibits a tradition (say untouchability) or empowers one (say right to free speech) the society could go general tradition. In case of "Father of the nation" title the Constitution doesn't allow the government to provide any title, but it cannot block the society from doing so. Sometimes these traditions are formalized by acts of the Parliament and other times they don't need to be. In case of holidays, the executive can declare any day to be a national holiday by just adding them to the Gazette.
