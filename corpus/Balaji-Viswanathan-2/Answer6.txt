 Some do. In my school, we had mock stock trading, covering even some advanced topics like debentures/preferred shares as early as 9th standard. It depends on how motivated, skilled and passionate the math/social science teachers are. Why don't many others do it?There is not enough recognition on the importance of investing/finance among the teachers. Some see the topics related to finance as too materialistic. Academia has historically been left leaning and topics like finance are not seen worth of their time. If I were to design the curriculum, I would just keep poetry, math, logic and personal finance as all other topics can be learned in adult life when basics are set right.The teachers themselves are very poor at investing or any topic related to personal finance. It is hard to get quality teachers who understand topics like investing and personal finance. The good ones in those topics go for more lucrative careers much early in the game.
