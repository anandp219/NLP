 Among the popular Tamil actors, many are/were light skinned - MGR, Kamal Hassan, Ajith to name a few. There were also a few dark skinned popular actresses such as Savithri. Only in the past two decades it seems to have shifted a lot into the lighter skinned actresses.While Tamils like many Indians prefer their icons light skinned, the male actors can get away with being dark if they can provide a powerful acting experience. Rajinikanth is dark skinned, but he has plenty of other positives to carry him through to the audience. The male actors have to be relatable and thus south Indian boys usually have a major advantage. On the other hand, actresses have no way to show their positives in acting qualities as their roles have become quite limited. Unlike even two decades ago, most of the actresses are brought from the north and the language is no big deal as they are not expected much anyway. They are made to play like dolls and in such a game the hottest light skinned girl wins regardless of how shabby the acting is. Since they have no character requirement to be relatable, homegrown girls don't have much advantage.
