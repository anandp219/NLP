 The premise is disputed. I will still take the bite. India is traditionally resource-constrained, while Europe & US is labor constrained. India has a lot of labor, and Europe-US have a lot of resources. This have an impact on the respective lifestyles.In the US, I can easily afford a Dishwasher, have access to reliable water and lot of electricity. In India, my maid would wash with much lesser water and electricity than that. While driving, I use the automatic in the US as the gas/petrol prices are quite low and the decrease in efficiency is worth the comfort. In India, the resource price is higher and might go for a chauffeur driving a manual. Most Indian families do fine in the US as they quickly adjust to the new society as above. They don't miss their maids and chauffeurs much.Things get tricky when you have a child. Unlike dishwashing or vacuuming, childcare cannot be automated and thus it is fairly hard to raise kids. You need to constantly look after them, run after them and clean after them. This is where many Indians miss labor abundance back home. Thus, many Indians ask the help of their parents to help with the kids. Locals too have huge trouble managing kids without nannies, but they have a wider support network [parents, siblings, friends, cousins] locally while Indians in US often have none. In summary, it is not about daily chores there is a problem. It is in raising kids where expat Indians often face a pain. Kids are lovely, but also take up a lot of energy to manage.
