 One thing I want to add to Luke's good answer is that it also depends on which class & locality you are born in. If you are going to be born as a poor villager, then India is likely worse than Vietnam, Iran and China. India's healthcare, sanitation and primary education is terrible if you are poor.If you are going to be born in a rich, urban family India is the best place to be in. Ultra rich often face trouble from the party in China and face slightly more security issues in Vietnam. A rich Indian can have an outsized power in the society, have access to great education & healthcare and can also greatly utilize India's fast growing economy. Politicians, media, army and the civil society will not come in the way of a rich person. If you are going to be in the urban middle class, it is a tie between China and India. Middle class Chinese have a variety of advantages - such as far better roads, airports, trains & uninterrupted power, while a middle class Indian has better political power, the benefit of English & better relations with the west to travel the world more. A simple example is that, for an Indian it is fairly easy to get a 10 year multiple entry visitor visa in US, while until recently Chinese were limited to 6 months at a time [due to reciprocal arrangements]. Middle class Indians and Chinese are thus roughly comparable in the range of benefits they can get from the society.Edit: There seems to be some confusion in the comment thread on what Middle Class means. Middle Class in Indian standards refers to about $600/month [10 times less than in the west] and that translates to about Rs. 40,000/month. Only a small fraction of India is in middle or upper middle. Everyone in India thinks they are 'middle class' and almost no one actually is
