 Many do. When I first arrived in the US in 2004, the Indian Student Association at my University took care of all the key details. They helped me get the I-20 in time for my visa interview, prepare for the visa interview, sent a list of things to buy in India before the journey, a temporary place to stay after I landed, apartment lists of suggested places to hunt my apartment, list of good professors to choose as an advisor, pick the bank to helping me file my tax forms at the end of the year. They were so good at guiding that by the end of the first two weeks I was helping out with a couple of American citizens on some of the forms and key things related to the university. I could also save a big chunk of money at the end of the tax year knowing what deductions to claim. Some of my friends also got internships and assistanceships through the association. Although I notice that such camaraderie has gone down in the last decade due to a huge influx of Indian immigrants, it still exists. In parallel, the Fresh off the Boat (FoB) Indians are also bringing a lot bigger attitude than in the past. They don't necessarily ask the right questions or follow the guidance. That often spooks those who have settled here for a while. Humility has to be there on both the sides.
