 A lot of us naively believe that we can build our new cities without taking any bit of agricultural or forest land. The fact is that there is hardly any good land left in India that somebody is not already using for something. 40,000 acres is about 161 sq km. That is barely enough for a major city. London and New Delhi are about 10 times bigger than that. If things go by plan, up to a quarter of Andhra's 5 crore people will live in this major metropolis extending from Guntur to Vijayawada. How do you accommodate that big a population with all their apartments, schools, roads and hospitals?Maybe AP could build its capital in western Rayalseema districts without a lot of fields. If you build the capital in say Anantapur district, where would you get the water to support crores of future residents to this new capital city? The district is bone dry as it is. You need a massive water source to support a crore people. Historically, great cities have always been built next to rivers or other great water sources. In case of AP, this would have to be Krishna or Godavari. The problem is that every bit of land next to these rivers is fertile & used for agriculture. There is no way to build a great city without taking agricultural lands and that was true of most of the great cities in the world - whether it is Delhi or London or New York. Andhra Pradesh has an area of 3,95,87,200 acres of which farm lands are nearly nearly two-thirds. It is not running out of farm lands any time soon. Far less than 1% of this farmland is taken away for the capital and all other infrastructure projects. If there is an agricultural crisis it is not due to a shortage of land, but due to mismanagement of water, poor access to technology and lower productivity of the fields. India could potentially double the farm productivity enabling it to cut the arable land by as much as a half in the future.
