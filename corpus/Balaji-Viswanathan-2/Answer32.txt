 As others mention, Japan and Germany have a sizable military. That said, post Second World War, both Japan and Germany put strong anti-war provisions in their Constitutions. This was partly pushed by the allies controlling their territory and partly came about as the moderates came out in disgust of the calamity. Article 9 of the Japanese ConstitutionThe world war also pushed out the hard right wing out of power for a long time. The prospect of having a highly weak army that would invariably draw comparisons with their military past also meant that military's purpose was strictly defined to domestic security. Also, the need for a large military became moot after the US military umbrella promised them to secure their resources. Hitler went after Russia to secure oil in its south. Japan went after SE Asia to secure iron ore and other raw materials. Post-WW2, both nations got all their major resource access protected by US and this provided very little rationale for war. In some sense, western nations pay an implicit tax to the US in return for US fighting wars to protect all of their trade routes and raw materials. This is Adam Smith's specialization.
