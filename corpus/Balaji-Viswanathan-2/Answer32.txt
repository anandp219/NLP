 There is a tempting myth that product managers and technical teams often fall into: More features = better. I have myself been guilty of these a lot of times.Consumers don't often see products in terms of features. They see in terms of benefits. WhatsApp is simple, stable and has already everyone you know in the network. Most users never hit the 25 MB/video or sending 10 images at a time. By not having those unnecessary features, WhatsApp is able to keep its UI easy even for a grandma and network so efficient to quickly move content across without crashing.Hike and Telegram are interesting tools used by millions of people. The additional features they have makes sense of their users. But for the majority, they are not as much relevant now.
