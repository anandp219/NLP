 Asian is a term too broad and is an outdated, Euro-centric way of looking at the world. Every civilization had an equivalent of "others" - people who were outside the civilization and Asia is just one such term [people who were not in Greek world of Europa]. It makes no sense to put Japan and Syria in the same bucket as there is very little connection between the two - no common history, language, race, religion etc. This map is a slightly better grouping of the world. It does a good job in most places. However, this too suffers by grouping Africa as a monolithic unit.Here is an even better map used by UN's food & agricultural organization.There is a glaring issue of grouping Iraq with South-Central Asia and not including Japan in East Asia, but overall the above is the most accurate I have found. Such grouping can help you understand world issues better.
