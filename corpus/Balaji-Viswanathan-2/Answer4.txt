 Here is my guess as I found no references. Ancient Tamils avoided living next to public squares where multiple roads meet. These places facing major thoroughfare are for public buildings - such as temples and palaces. Due to the large movement of people, these were noisy and possibly even risky to have homes there. A common type of these are Three-way junctions (Muchandi) where the Tamils would not build homes. Facing such a junction is both losing privacy and also extra noise. It makes practical sense. Better to build a temple or some other public building there.In the modern world, we start fitting our old assumptions to the new reality. Some see the cul-de-sac akin to three way junctions [home opposite to the oncoming road] and fit the old assumptions. We don't question the purpose of the practice and make it a boolean decision [our ancestors were always right OR our culture is outdated].
