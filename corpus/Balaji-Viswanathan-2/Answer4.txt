 Indian history is far too complex to be reduced to just Hindu rulers vs. others. For most of history until the modern era, the unit of territory was empires and not nations. Thus, kings allied with other kings and not always guided by religion and nation. Unlike Europe where the Popes were agitating the kings in Crusades leading to long standing enmities between the two religions, there are no central authorities in Hinduism.That said, there were many cases of collective fight by Hindu rulers. In the Battle of Delhi (1556), Hemu recaptured Delhi with the help of many Hindu lords and but for a stray arrow that struck his eye in the Second Battle of Panipat, he could have won the Mughals. Couple of centuries later it was followed by the Maratha Empire that put out the Mughals. In the south, the 13th century Vijayanagara Empire was founded as a reaction to the invasions and they were among the first Indian empires to use gunpowder. Civilizations rise and fall and no empire can keep up for more than few centuries at a time. For instance, the longest empire in China ran for just 400 years (Han dynasty) although the Middle Kingdom was mostly isolated from the rest of the world by geography. Sooner or later a weak descendant takes the empire and leads it into a collapse. Once the empire collapses, it is not easy to replace with a local one as there are no easy ways of succession. Power has its own natural dynamics and it has to form through a complex process.Classic Hindu empires had collapsed long before the Afghans attacked India in the 12th century. For all his valor, Prithvi Raj Chauhan is no comparison to the great emperors India in terms of empire and prosperity. By that time India was in a period of interregnum. In the east, Palas had gone and in the south the Cholas were out of the scene. Thus, there was no big resistance and it took a few centuries to regroup.
