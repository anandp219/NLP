 Let me offer a few counterexamples. The daughter of the fire god Agni is the powerful Agneya who is invoked in every major ritual. The supreme Vedic god Tvastar is the father of Saranya who married the Sun god to bear the god of death - Yama. In Tamil scriptures we have god of thunder Indra's daughter Devasena marrying Lord Karthikeya. Lord Shiva's wives - Parvati and Ganga are the daughters of Parvateshwar/Himavan - the god of mountains. Lord Krishna had a number of daughters including Charumati, Bhanu, Mitravati etc (Ashtabharya). One group of scriptures talk of Saraswati being the daughter of Brahma although there are different interpretations of this.In summary, the premise of this question ("Why are there no girl children of Hindu gods") is invalid.
