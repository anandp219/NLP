 Media relies on sensation to sell their wares. Good is boring, while tragedy is interesting. Would you rather watch a documentary or a masala laden Bollywood movie?It has been quite a slow season so far. No big riots, no skyrocketing inflation, no eyepopping scandals, no major guffaws, no wars, no disease outbreaks [since the time of writing this, Dengue outbreak has become an issue in Delhi though], no party breakaways. I mean, Modi becoming India's PM should have released pogroms and riots everywhere as Hindutva forces would destroy India and immerse in pool of blood. None of that materialized and it is like an action movie where the trailer promises a lot of blood, but the movie is just normal stuff. This is bad for business. Thus, they have to report on whatever gossip they can - whether Modi moving Zuckerberg for the camera, Satya Nadella wiping hands, Modi wearing suits with his name and whatever. Who knows why Mr. Nadella wipes his hands? Maybe he doesn't like Modi and that's why he traveled all the way to San Jose & introduced new Microsoft plans to Indian villages. Know that, you don't grow that fast at Microsoft by insulting powerful people. He is too smart to do that.Maybe he wipes his palms all the time because it does get hot in California. Maybe he was nervous or tired or anxious or worried about something else Microsoft was doing. None of this is any of our business. Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people. ---- Eleanor Roosevelt
