 Many nationalist Indians would say yes. And once India has joined Nepal, there would be reallocation of seats in the legislature. Given India's size and population, 95% of the Nepali parliament would be Indians. These legislators would then pass a law to change the name of the country to India and change some of the national symbols. The rest of it would not have to change much as India and Nepal share a common culture. Job done ;-)I always smile when nationalists of other countries desire for a large chunk of India. There is the "Greater Nepal" or "Khoarsan", "Mughalistan" etc. If a sizable chunk of India is joined with Nepal or Pakistan or whatever other country, that resulting county would be Hindu by the sheer size of Indian population. Thus, Indians would be the dominant population in that "Greater Nepal" and they would legislate a variety of things that Nepalese might not like.
