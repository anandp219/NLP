 The people who keep overemphasizing the victory of the Labour government in 1945, don't often understand the sequence of steps that led up to India's independence. Labour election sure was important, but it just hastened the process by a couple of years. In May 1945, Lord Wavell [then the Viceroy of India] presented a detailed plan to the Indians for divesting the power. In the plan - Simla Conference - Indians would get full control of everything other than defense and foreign policy. In the government, only the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief would be British and the rest would be Indians. And this was done when Churchill was still in power. This was again a big move from the Government of India Act 1935, when Indians were allowed to elect their own governments, although their powers would be limited. Indians still didn't accept Wavell's plan as they wanted nothing but independence. By 1945, it already appeared to the British that India could not be ruled without the consent of Indians. Congress made it very expensive to conduct a government and various economic blockades by Gandhi made India not very profitable colony. The end of war also meant that the Indian soldiers and workers were not needed in as big numbers. Had the British tried to continue past 1947, there would have been chaos for which British government was not prepared for. As the old saying goes, British Indian government would drown in flood if the 400 million Indians were to just spit. By 1947, Indians were prepared for that and from that point it was impossible to govern. The best that was hoped was a respectful exit and continuation of economic ties.
