 Arkarup Gupta has already provided a good answer on this. Here is what I would add:Mars mission was a highly planned mission launched from well built launch pad. You cannot launch an ICBM from such comfort. The enemy would look to destroy such sophisticated launching pads in an instant. You need to be able to fire ICBMs without much planning, from mobile launch pads and without sophisticated technology like cryogenic engines (not used for MOM mission, but for the largest rockets like GSLV) that might take elaborate preparation as you cannot keep liquid oxygen and hydrogen for long periods in random places. Indias GSLV Mark III: Another step aheadAccuracy of nuclear weapon carrying ICBM should be far higher than that of a satellite that might have a higher margin of error.ICBMs exit the atmosphere and reenter at hypersonic speeds (Atmospheric entry). That requires better heat shields and much stronger materials than satellite launch vehicles which most often just have to exit.The ability to use the rockets both for peaceful and military purposes is termed the Dual-use technology. Historically, Indian space program had severe restrictions due to this and Indian government had to convince a lot to keep ISRO out of the provisions of the weapons treaties. If technology were transferred, it would lead to future trouble. That said, if things get problematic as in a war, India might be able to reuse part of the technology. Some believe that the semi-mythical Indian ICBM of Surya missile is an under the wraps PSLV rocket that could anytime be modified as a missile (India Missile Test: Wake Up, Washington!). Many countries have done the reverse though - reusing ICBM technology as launch vehicles. A space launch vehicle by any other name
