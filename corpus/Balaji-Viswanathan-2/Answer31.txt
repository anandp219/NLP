 Around the world people do crazy things to appear attractive. The whole world of cosmetics and cosmetic surgeries would be out of business if people stopped being insecure of their beauty. Think of tanning salons, sunbathing, fairness creams, tattoos, skin piercing... people in every part of the world do dangerous things in their pursuit of beauty. And this didn't start in modern era, but is as old as human civilization. Tribes around the world have painted their faces in all sorts of fancy colors for ceremonial reasons as well as for aesthetic reasons.We probably carry innate animal tendencies to spend effort on looking for our mate and make ourselves attractive in the process. Skin is a good indicator of a body's health and thus people do all sorts of things to make the skin appear good to "prospective mates". In some places, tribes would abandon their children or even kill if they were born light skinned (Persecution of people with albinism). In other places, being born as dark skinned would bring discrimination. It is all about what each society thinks of being healthy. And in modern world most often these are stupid intolerance.
