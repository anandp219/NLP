 Kali linux is not developed in India. Its lead developers are based in US/Canada who work with Israeli military (About Kali Linux).And they have mentioned that the name officially has nothing to do with the Hindu god. Kali Linux  Whats in a Name?Hindu Goddess of time and change? Philippine martial art? Cool word in Swahili? None of the above. Kali is simply the name we came up with for our new distribution. Why change the name in the first place? With all these significant changes in our distribution, we felt that we needed to convey this in the project name. BackTrack 6 didnt do justice to our efforts in the past year, and wouldnt convey our new message to our users. Whats the new message? Well let you find out for yourself.1.3 billion Indians would have different perspectives on the use of names of Hindu gods. Many practicing Hindus would be offended by such naming as it both trivializes cultural concepts as well as opens scope for disrespect [someone could step over a T-shirt with the name Kali written on it]. But, most won't make any fuss about it.
