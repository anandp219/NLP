 In many cases it was threat of outright power and war. The most dramatic of this is the Indian integration of Hyderabad. That kingdom was as big as the whole of UK and Patel's troops annexed it under 5 days with a loss of just 32 men. They called it a "Police Action" to avoid getting attention in the international community It was among the most efficient military operations in history although the whole period before and after the operation was marred with massive atrocities against both Hindus and Muslims.The swift operation by Patel's men and excellent diplomacy by Nehru's meant that UN Security Council could not do much despite all of Hyderabad's and Pakistan's pleading. Patel also silently let the Communists weaken the Nizam's forces through massive peasant agitations in the months leading up to the annexation. In case of Junagadh that makes a sizable chunk of present Gujarat, India sort of waited until the opponent made a mistake and made full use of it. The nawab had already left the state and its new head Shah Nawaz Bhutto [grandfather of Benazir Bhutto and father of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto] made the mistake of annexing a couple of smaller rulers who had already conveyed an intention to join India. This act was use as a pretext to attack and again very swiftly bring the state into India. A plebiscite was later held to confirm the verdict. Indian integration of JunagadhIn case of Travancore [most of present Kerala] the king thought he had ports and economy to stake on his own Hindu kingdom. Once again the Communists helped Patel's cause. A massive peasant unrest and an assassination attempt on the diwan C. P. Ramaswami Iyer [likely Patel had nothing to do with this] brought the king crawling to join India. An excellent book on this is the THE STORY OF THE INTEGRATION OF THE INDIAN STATES by the VP Menon [the person who did the job for Patel]
