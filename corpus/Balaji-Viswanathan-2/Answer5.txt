 The Indo-Gangetic Plain that makes most of north India is the largest alluvial plain on entire earth. It spans some 630 million acres from the Indus to the Brahmaputra. It is watered by three great, independent, perennial river systems - Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra. Within this Indo-Gangetic plain there is no major mountain range, forest, lake or other natural barriers to prevent a consolidation of power.When someone asks why north India has so much people or why so many empires grew there, the simple answer is that the spread of water and silt over such a large region is not seen anywhere on earth. South India has no glacier fed perennial rivers nor such a big plain. The Ganges Basin alone is over 3 times the size of the Godhavari basin and about 12 times larger than the Kaveri basin. The plains of the south are smaller and divided by a number of large forests. Why is this relevant? The size and power of empires depended on the power of agricultural output that could be produced. Thus, northern empires were often much bigger than the southern ones. Also, within such a massive landmass there were frequent opportunity for feud. Such feuds are topics of a number of stories starting from the Rig Vedic Battle of the Ten Kings. South had fighting too, but the landmass provided some natural boundaries for the kings and due to the smaller size the battles were somewhat small too. Given the size and power of the Gangetic valley, it is not surprising that major battles happened there and major empires grew there. Mahabharata and Ramayana are epics about those northern empires. South has its glorious epics too - from the ancient Silapathigaram to modern day Ponniyin Selvan, just that most in the north don't take too much interest in them.
