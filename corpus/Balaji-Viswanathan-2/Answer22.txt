 It is an outdated theory that refuses to die. The idea is that there was a huge lost continent south of Tamil Nadu. While many civilizations believe in such submerged islands [Atlantis], the sheer size & imagination of Lemuria is massive. If it were a country it would probably be the second largest. When I was a school kid I too fantasized about that after being misinformed by some of my school teachers. The idea was invented in the 1860s when an English zoologist noted that there were these monkeys called Lemur that were found in Madagascar, India and some parts of South East Asia. Thus, he had an hypothesis that a landmass connected all the three. Later as we begun understanding geography and human evolution better this theory became untenable. While the scientists abandoned this theory, a fringe group of Indian/Tamil supremacists took hold of that theory. Around the turn of the 20th century, there was a huge interest in race, migration and nationalism. Some Indians thought that the superior blooded Aryans came from the North pole while a few others thought the Dravidians came from this lost continent. Both sides wanted to boost their egos at a time when the wave of nationalism and identity seeking at its heaviest. There surely was a massive landmass under Indian Ocean, but that was between 2 billion - 85 million years ago. Far before mammals, leave alone humans. Fragments of ancient continent buried under Indian OceanWhile I believe that there were such massive landmasses well before human history and there were possibly many cities submerged near TN coast line, it is crazy to believe in a huge continent that supported the ancient Tamil civilization.
