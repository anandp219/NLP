 Let's separate Qatar & Brunei from Luxembourg, Singapore, Hong Kong, Liechtenstein etc. Qatar has the world's third largest deposits of natural gas and has less than 300,000 citizens. If you divide that large a resource among that small a population you get crazy high income. Apart from the energy, it doesn't have any important industry worth mentioning. Brunei is somewhat close to that description.Regarding Singapore, Hong Kong, Luxembourg etc they are trading cities sitting next to massive countries. Cities are in general wealthier than the countryside. If Mumbai and Shanghai were counted as independent countries, they have a higher GDP than Singapore and Hong Kong compressed in a comparable geographic area. List of cities by GDP. Does that mean Mumbai and Shanghai are better than Singapore and Hong Kong? By being counted in larger nations with much higher rural population their GDPs are sometimes less appreciated.Thus, it is not about being a small country or a large country. It is about being a city sitting in an important trade route vs. a rural region stuck somewhere. Singapore is a small rich city-state in an important trade route while Nauru is a small poor rural nation that has no such benefit. In the same way, USA is an large rich urbanized nation with massive amount of trade while India is a large poor rural nation with far less trade. While we should surely learn a lot from Singapore and Hong Kong, we should also make sure we are comparing apples vs apples - Singapore vs commercial cities in a country than the entire country itself.
