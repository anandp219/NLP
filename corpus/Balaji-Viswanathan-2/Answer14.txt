 The biggest feature that will make or break India is its demographic. We have the world's largest population of youth by a huge margin. We have 356 million people in the age group 10-24 years old. That is more youth than US and China combined. India has worlds largest youth population: UN reportThis means we have a population that can potentially jump to the newest technologies and ideas without the burden of past baggage just as easily as Indians took Quora. We could quickly climb up the economic ladder by skipping past the past. Politics can move quite quickly the elections of Modi and Kejriwal showed. On the flip side, we have a huge population for which we don't generate enough jobs or have enough skill development avenues. Unemployment, crime and social unrest can happen if the expectations are not matched. The second feature is the arable land. India has almost as much arable land as United States - world's leader in that measure. With 162 million hectares of fertile land, India has more agricultural land than even China with more than thrice its area. This was the key feature that helped India throughout history. However, as we need land to build homes, factories and roads, we would have to take a chunk of this arable land. We cannot eliminate poverty without building people homes and jobs. This means India's success or failure will depend on how much of the agricultural land it can take away for other uses & make sure these are utilized well.
