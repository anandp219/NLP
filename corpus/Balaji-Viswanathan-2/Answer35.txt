 War is one of the biggest motivators to bring new technology. WW2 drastically increased the money, motivation and political resources available for science. Two related factors that really revolutionized science was the Tizard Mission - where the UK effectively gave away all its tech secrets to the US so as to build enough weapons to counter Germany. The second one was the German scientists who were then given the resources of US and USSR after the war to build massive projects. US got to moon with a Nazi scientist. Space explorationNazi Germany originally developed the V-2 rocket to hit Britain. It was the world's first ballistic missile. After the war, US and USSR split up Germany and got a large number of these German missiles, facilities and scientists. This is how both countries got to space in the 1950s. Nuclear ResearchThe Manhattan project to develop the atom bomb was the largest ever research project until that time. The race to build the bomb produced major breakthroughs. A decade post the war, Soviet Union [again with the help of German scientists] began civilian production of electricity and two decades later it became a key energy source for the world.MedicineAlthough Fleming had invented Penicillin in 1928, it was not put to wide use. It just stayed low until war needed it. Suddenly it was produced at massive numbers and had a major change in global health. The cavity Air travelUntil 1940s, air travel was primarily for the adventurers. The main issue was the cabin was not pressurized leading to very high discomfort when flying high. For the war, Boeing produced B-29 that had cabin pressure and this quickly became a standard in civilian aircrafts. How Things Work: Cabin Pressure. Radars, radio navigation and a variety of things needed for modern aircraft have their origins in the war. More importantly, we now had Jet engines due to the war allowing much higher speed and range of airplanes. CookingMicrowave oven really became a practicality only when cavity magnetron was invented. Someone (Percy Spencer) working at Raytheon found melting chocolate in his pocket and that became the motivation for the oven.ComputingWhile computers were around for more than a century, they never got major government patronage or big use case. The need to break enigma machine provided all the resources needed to make a computer work. Without the war, introduction of computers might have been delayed by a couple of decades.
