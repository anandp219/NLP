 Every god needs a satan. Every revolution needs an enemy to turn people's anger upon.Iran and Israel historically had good relationships. Iran helped Israel in this war against Egypt, and in turn Israel helped Iran fight Iraq. However, the 1979 islamic revolution needed an enemy. The Ayatollah could not make Saudi Arabia his #1 enemy as the place is too sacred for Muslims. Israel and US became the easy enemy. Even when they have often worked together behind the scenes, there has to be a public appearance of beating the enemy and this is important in every revolution. Israel and US helped the Shah & indirectly helped fight the revolution. This was one of the angers. Israel stands in Iran's way to develop nuclear weapons. Iran uses its proxy armies in Hizbollah and Hamas to control the region and this affects Israel's interests. Iran also wants to be seen as the leader of Islam and shouting for Palestinian interests brings credibility & attention.The Iran-Iraq war of 1980s provided a period of common interests. In 1988, the end of Iran-Iraq war and the scandal of the IranContra affair [involving US-Israeli arms trade to Iran] pushed Israel & Iran back. Iran also moved closer to Saudi Arabia this time. For both sides there is a fear of survival. Iranian government fears the failure of revolution if the lightning rod of their hatred - Israel goes away and people warm up to western ideas & culture. Israel government fears the further expansion of Hezbollah and Hamas.
