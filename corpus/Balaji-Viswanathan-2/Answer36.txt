 Let's start with the assumption. Kashmiris Muslims hate India. Many do hate, but not all. What about the minority of Kashmiri Muslims that love India? What about their fate if the state is taken over by Pakistan? What about the fate of Kashmir's non-Muslims? The state of Jammu & Kashmir especially has large regions of Hindu and Buddhist populations whose fate is dreadful if India gives up the state. Protecting the millions of Kashmiris from chaos is what India wants. Because, we don't want another 1947 and another failed stated in the border.Why would India never give up Kashmir?The state of Hindus and Buddhists in Pakistan are far worse than the state of Muslims in India. The lives of few million people is worth the trouble.Indus waters through the state is essential for India's water security. Without that north India would be in a chaos.The high hills are also India's main defense for its northern plains. If J&K goes to Pakistan, Indian Punjab can be surrounded quite easily on 3 sides and the capital would be only a few hours drive from Pakistan. The state has already returned to peace and only recently turned to the voting booths in large numbers, placing their hopes on Indian democracy. India can always further reduce the anger by providing better infrastructure and having a more transparent law enforcement.
