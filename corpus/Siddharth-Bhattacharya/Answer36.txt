 could at least clear prelims- it was all about curiosity. When I couldn't excel in my college- I searched other avenues. Tried inter-college events: won various accolades. By the end- though I am nowhere near the best in my college- I've won accolades representing my college, within my college, as well as featured 2-3 times on TV. And I still suck at ME(L)A.How to increase curiosity? I repeat- don't for the sake of quizzing. However if you are already curious and want to increase it, whenever you read 'something somewhere' or see some reference say in popular culture, do make a point to find out about it. Example: Homer Simpson mentioned Tianmen Sqaure. Don't know what it is? Keep it cached in your brain on things-to-google-next-time-I-use-internet. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sample question: School quizzing- Which is the 8th largest country in the world? Working it out: So you know India is the 7th largest country. Which is the 8th? You don't know? There's not much you can do about it apart from remembering some large countries in the map and picking some random one. Answer: ArgentinaCollege quizzing- In 1757 after the Battle of Plassey when Robert Clive defeated Siraj ud-Daula he needed to pray to thank the Lord. But since the Nawab had destroyed the only church in the city he couldn't. Seeing the opportunity, a group of businessmen/merchants organized a ceremony for him so that he could still thank God. Widely praised, it went on to be an annual ceremony and continues till date in India. What are we talking about? Working it out: Where is Plassey? Where was Siraj-ud-Daula the Nawab of? If you know, great- we're one step closer. If you don't, it's still not over. What ceremony could the businessmen have thought? The idea was to pray to God. Some religious ceremony? Continues till date & widely praised: seems grandiose. Which religion? From the scale, can be Hinduism. If you don't know the state, guess some annual Hindu religious ceremony like Ganesh Chaturthi. If you do know the state is Bengal, the answer is of course- Durga Puja. Answer: We had no clue, but we just worked-it-out. Yipee!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Remember: don't do anything out of your way for the sake of becoming a good quizzer. Read/ see stuff which interests you, go into it's depths, attend quizzes with an open brain and the results will follow after some time.
