 According to me, the beauty of the book lies not in the character of only Vito Corleone but the presence of the marginal character called Kay Adams- Michael's wife. She's not a prominent character, thus not making it a full-blown ethical debate. This image will help in the analysis of Vito's goodness: On one side we have the towering character of Vito Corleone who speaks of capitalism, hard-work, how all is he doing is out of necessity due to the government being crooks themselves. Using 'survival' argument of 'filling one's stomach'. He also makes some marvelous offers difficult to refuse. The reader is enamored by his charm. Gambling is after all not such a huge moral issue. And then slowly Puzo unveils what these offers were- involving bloodshed, killing- deciding who was worth living (Fannucci). Nevertheless Vito's survival arguments makes us willing to accept this new dimension of him. He represents what we want to be- powerful person, who in his deathbed could say "Life is Beautiful". And that's where Kay comes in-- she is a manifestation of our conscience. A small voice within us nagging "But really, is Vito right? Do I want to become like him". And these small voices within us in the end decide for us how we perceive Vito- a good person or a bad person. Vito has numerous good qualities- helping needy, ones he loves- like his godson- Jonny, he loves his sons (other than Fredo), Tom who he has adopted. So dismissing Vito as an outright bad person would be inappropriate. He is not a bad person, but he has a compelling aura which makes the reader want to emulate him. He maybe good person- but what he did was not, and Kay's sound constantly reminds us he's not that good either. In summary, Vito like every human being has shades of grey- he is neither good nor bad absolutely and what makes the novel beautiful is manifestation of his both sides.
