 Xbox, Bing as well as great enterprise stuff such as SQL Server/Azure [3] along with acquisitions like Skype and Nokia (the other company which caught my fascination in those years, but they're hardware--which was too difficult for my small brain).So these things when combined did add up to validation as David says, but the desire to work for them largely follows an association with them. While other companies have to hard-sell to me what innovations they're making, Google/MS needed no introduction. I knew they're making impact (being a witness to their impact myself), and needed no stats to verify this. And as I said, being founded by hardcore tech guys rather than "sales/design guys wanting a tech co-founder", they enjoy a positive reputation among tech-geeks, who dislike management interference. For American kids, I guess Microsoft was old-school by early 2000's itself and they've grown with Facebook dominating their social lives. (I know many Indian friends working at FB, but few have been obsessed about it from long back) I guess many people in the next 5-10 years will be indeed obsessed with working for FB as well as Apple for the same reasons I mentioned, of associating with the companies. So all in all, along with the obvious reasons of money, security, perks, brand name on resume, career growth it also includes associating with them and wanting to give back to the companies which helped change our lives for the positive. Of course as I said, this doesn't mean they are indeed the best companies to work for in terms of satisfaction, career growth, individual impact, bureaucracy, perks etc (although even in worst case, they're pretty good in all the metrics). Those things vary for every individual, and can be rationalized. But the obsession as asked in the question isn't a very rational feeling and that's why most people would jump at a job-offer from these companies (as a developer at least) irrespective of whether it will be the "best work" in terms of learning or even long-term monetary maximization.Ending on a positive note, I finally have been able to fulfill my obsession. I started as a software developer for Microsoft (at HQ) two weeks ago for Excel team - one of it's finest products in my opinion. And of course, the code has enough legacy, there is process overhead as you'd expect in a giant organization but a part of me has been fulfilled by just being able to be a part of the history of organization which shaped my childhood.
