 following them can really lift one's mood. This picture is from Inverness, Scotland.As I said before, meeting new people. An easy way is staying in youth hostels, and interacting with fellow travelers. Other times it becomes possible while clicking pictures for others for instance.Getting lost. As others would have said already, this ends up being amazing. It kills off the predictability. It's like unlearning whatever you know and learning it again your own way. You will discover cheap ways of traveling, even probably hitchhike and end up in lots of adventurous things you wouldn't have thought otherwise. The point is- these will be facilitated by you being alone. For example, hitchhiking- neither will your group think of it as a credible alternative most times nor will riders be willing to give ride to a larger group due to space constraints or otherwise.Picture: Got to play beach volleyball with 'players' in Covent Garden, London (UK) while traveling alone.ConsEconomically it can be a drain lots of times. For instance, if you need to take a cab for some reason. Splitting costs always helps. Similar for paying for hotels and likewise if there's no hostels available.You don't need to click photos everywhere you go, but it doesn't hurt to have one good picture at a place. Seeing these later will bring back refreshing memories. Without a group, it becomes difficult. Lots of places you'll be doing the selfie, before giving up for all the bad pics or if you find fellow travelers, ask them for help. Who knows it may help you bond with them.Image: Poor me attempting a selfie in Thimpu, BhutanThe biggest con is obviously though it is depressing. A lot at times. You see all those couples walking affectionately, groups of friends having fun and your own life seems hopeless. You appreciate architecture, but for how long? The lake is pleasant, the mountains are beautiful but alone it loses it's charm in sometime. This does happen. And is countered only by finding other people. Or groups of people where you can just mix in.I wouldn't advise everyone to go for it. In all fairness, not everyone likes an adventure with lots of depressing moments for learning something in life. To me, traveling alone is a high-risk, high-reward gamble. But if you do want to challenge yourself, and can go outside your comfort zone then especially in another country traveling alone can work wonders. In ways, you would never have anticipated. So if you can't convince friends, go for it alone.You might also like some things about Thailand that foreigners do not believe until they arrive?Bonus: some funny/interesting things that have happened to me while traveling
