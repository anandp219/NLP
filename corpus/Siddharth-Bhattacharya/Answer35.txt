 Sorry. In my process of answering, I'll be intentionally violating one of Quora's unsaid norms- 'not mentioning the same name as another answerer'. The purpose of me adding the same answer is not being satisfied with the explanation provided of why one would recommend it so I'd add the same name though elaborate differently than existing answer. My choice is Death Note.So what's so splendid about it and why would I recommend only this? At superficial level, Death Note is a mad-rush between two extremely intelligent lads L & Yagami Light outclassing each other by wits. We can call it a detective sci-fi. But if one wants to go deep, there's endless at offer. That too in only 37 episodes of about 20 minutes. The character of Yagami Light offers varied perspectives on wide-range of ethical conflicts: an intelligent, hard-working student dreaming of changing the world and weeding out evil if given the opportunity actually finds one. The series is a glimpse of the wide array of possibilities of how a well-meaning individual can detract from good causes with the availability of power. The series also has subtle commentary on mob behavior. As the series progresses, Light's character gets darker but even at the peak of this transition, the mob is equally divided into the ethical implications of his actions. It's tempting to brand Light as good/bad, but the realization that he embodies various shades of grey makes the anime a must watch.Review on my blog: Death NoteNote: To clarify my intentions again, there are questions in Best of X with one-line answers, to which the studious Aman Anand frames questions in the What Is So Great About X? topic for explanations. I thought we could do both in the same place, and provide explanations to our choice than just naming it.
