 always Dharmashala). A crowded Indian marketHygiene problems: Even though most of the friends I traveled with were eventually getting reckless with experimenting Indian street food because it's delicious, one particular French friend of mine was cautious and eating only from restaurants, drinking bottled water. However this did not save her from getting terribly upset stomach and having to go to hospital. Delhi Belly is for real. Streets in India are extremely dirty, and same with the water we drink and food we eat. It maybe way more tastier, but foreigners have a hard time adjusting to the quality of sanitation in India. However there's significant hope for tourism to be revived due to the following reasons: Soft power: India has immense soft power from Russia, China to US. Yoga is extremely cool in the West, same with our delicious food as well as the melodramatic Bollywood industry which for some reason excites people across the globe. We're popular as the nation of "peaceful Gandhi". Sanskrit/Hindi words find usage a lot in English. Despite it's negative reputation with filth and women rights India enjoys a great soft power infiltration making it more significant in people's mind.Hippy love: In the coop I lived in, out of my 25 housemates 4 had lived in India for more than 3 months, 3 others were taking lessons in Sanskrit/Hindi and were good enough at speaking it (all Americans). India finds a love affair with many Western hippy-esque people as the land of mysticism, history, culture and spirituality. Indian classical music delights them and the stink of toilets is not enough of a deterrent for these folks to bagpack around India. Beatles' sojourn in India created a new generation of India-loving hippiesCheap: India is too cheap and foreigners just love it. Even though they're charged differentially for entry into tourist sites, it is really an insignificant amount in dollars (although for non Western Europeans/Americans it can be a pain). The availability of hotel rooms for Rs 500 ($ 8) even in touristy cities like Goa, Jaisalmer makes it a really attractive way to spend for someone who's saved up and doesn't want to be out of cash in a week or two. Even though a hotel revolution providing them with better amenities might attract certain tourists, for thrifty tourists India can be paradise.Therefore Indian tourism faces some major hurdles, some of which can be resolved by the government, but the rest will take efforts by the society at large. But rest assured, India has a potential as a huge tourist destination given it's soft-cultural penetration. As Jairam Ramesh initially quoted and NaMo reiterated we need "toilets first, temples later". The temples can get lots of tourists, but the lack of toilets can turn away more tourists than that for sure.
