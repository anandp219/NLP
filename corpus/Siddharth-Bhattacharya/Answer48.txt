 to distribute subjects between yourselves thus creating a 'sense of threat' by citing each other's name. So you both battle it out on a public platform in a heated manner, convincing half of them to move either way. On the positive side you've lesser people to manage, on the negative side you've lesser manpower. But the best part is- all people in your 'nation' work in similar direction. You constantly deploy the rhetoric of how the other guy would 'attack' if people deviate. To hold on to people's trust, you actually feign a few skirmishes. But despite these few tid-bits you've achieved what you set out for- avoiding anarchy & rather maximizing collective output. All's well, that ends well. But the ending remains. To ensure moral conduct, you needed religion. This alone was not sufficient. You needed enforcing punishments. For this you need to retain the central authority allowing you to punish. Either you become 'human representative' of the God or simply use the authority as 'head of nation' to punish deviants. With time you realize the former raises questions as more people refuse to accept concept 'God's messenger' for punishment. On the other hand the rhetoric of nation citing threats gives you credible central authority to impose the punishments. Slowly more people question various aspects of your stories- religion, nation. So you've the task to decide which to let go of to retain trust of people. And here you realize- you can afford to dilute religion, but the nation is far more important (the power of religion is a part of the power of nation). By all means, you hold on to nation to avoid anarchy & effective implementation of regulations & incentives. Retaining the trust in nation often requires investments- invention of more threats, some actual threats (as relations deteriorate) but you're ready to walk the extra mile to ensure anarchy doesn't break loose within your territory.Where did race, caste come from? Inventing those 'ideologies' for creating more nations required fomenting divisions. It started with tapping natural differences such as color/race, gender and moved on to artificial ones like castes.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now enter reality: Religious head though powerful has always been less powerful than the state which controlled economic means as well as legislation. It was always more acceptable to let go of the concepts of religion & other things since they're making it easier for the nation rhetoric (overuse of the same 'nation' rhetoric will turn off people). So the governments go to great lengths to preserve & instill patriotism- championing history, culture and fostering unity through even sports. So it's not in the best interests of society to let go of patriotism and people in power therefore ensure it's "a widely celebrated form of identity affirmation".Should you question patriotism like other constructs? By all means, Yes. The problem is obviously in the assumption of the head of society who wants only societal progress. Reality is not so idealistic. But before questioning do remember the uses of these constructs and how they have evolved over time.Note: Some have an issue that I haven't addressed whether we should question these norms or not. The question asks for why things are as they are, and it's essential we understand social construction of these norms to understand status quo.
