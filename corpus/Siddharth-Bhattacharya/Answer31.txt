 In just the words of the curious student who confronts the professor, "God" (rather than "evil") is like "cold" and "darkness". God is a concept humans have invented when there have been insufficient answers or convincing evidence regarding phenomenon we see daily around ourselves. Science by it's nature can never completely answer all phenomena because finding one explanation opens up other questions. We fill the void in our knowledge with the concept of "God". So in the words of the young man (with slight modifications): "In fact sir, God does not exist. According to the laws of arguments/theology/science(?), what we consider God is in reality the absence of scientific evidence (or sometimes lack of a very layman explanation to be able to convince priests). God does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no explanation of why things are the way they are."
