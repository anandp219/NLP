 formal devices that redundantly cross-reference the subject matter in a sentence, listeners are much less likely to misunderstand what is being said, and so much less likely to misbehave accordingly. Thus, even if the genders were purely formal, in which members did not share any semantic traits at all, gender agreement would still be useful.As for specific languages, it is always necessary to refer to the specific history of grammaticalization in specific languages, and we often do not know enough about that history to be certain why a particular gender system arose. English is an Indo-European language, and we know enough about Proto-Indo-European to believe that at some early stage PIE had two genders, animate and inanimate (a system attested in the earliest language to branch off, Hittite). Later, it developed a set of suffixes specifically for feminine entities, thus producing the classical three-way masculine~feminine~neuter split seen in languages like Latin, Greek, Sanskrit and German. So, why did PIE have an animate~inanimate contrast in the first place? We just don't know, since we don't know enough about how Indo-European relates to other language families to make even good guesses about this aspect of its grammar.In the case of English, we inherited a three-way gender system from Indo-European via Proto-Germanic, which like continental languages was formal: Old English man 'man' was masculine because it agreed with the article se 'the (masc.)', while wifman 'woman' was also masculine in gender, because it also agreed with se and not with feminine so or neuter t. Because in English most of these agreement patterns were borne by affixes in rather convoluted case-number paradigms, even a small unrelated sound change like the loss of final vowels could upend the entire system, and this is exactly what happened. In many languages, this would have led to the loss of gender entirely, but because English preserved gender contrasts in pronouns, the system was changed from a formally defined morphological gender system to a wholly semantically defined anaphoric gender system. The bottom line: gender refers to categories of words, not biological sex, and serves a functional purpose in the languages that possess it.[1] Although 'gender' has been used since the Middle Ages to refer to men and women viewed as kinds of groups, the sociological concept of gender as the cultural differences that distinguish men from women did not arise until the mid 20th century.
