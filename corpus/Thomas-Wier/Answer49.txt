 I think Geoff Pullum has addressed this issue at length in his many public comments about the way grammar is taught in the English speaking world today. Basically, he argues that grammar teaching hasn't really advanced substantially in two centuries, and the result is that people believe and teach all sorts of crazy unfounded things about language. Here's an excerpt about him in the Telegraph (Are 'grammar Nazis' ruining the English language? ):Imagine a world in which biology was taught using no textbooks written later than 1795; a world in which the advances of the science since the publication of On the Origin of Species  or even since Charles Darwin was born  were ignored. The theory of evolution would remain untaught; the existence of bacteria would never be mentioned. Biologists would be furious. So imagine how Prof Geoffrey Pullum feels when he sees the same thing happening in his own field every day. [...]Rules such as this have been discovered through careful study of how English speakers actually use the language. An enormous amount more is understood today than it was in, say, 1900, says Pullum. There have been discoveries that make the pattern of things easier to grasp.But instead of this sort of discovery making it into popular consciousness, he says, the national discussion of grammar and language is stuck in half-remembered dictates and daft shibboleths. What is taught in schools, and in popular books for laypeople, is the same as it was in 1900, and much the same as it was in 1800. The public is denied all of it.In other words, there are plenty of otherwise educated, intelligent people out there who simply are ignorant of the way the world actually works. If we taught grammar in public schools like we taught chemistry, people would have a better understanding of what language is, and how it functions.
