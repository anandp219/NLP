 The short answer is no. This is because writing is not merely a means of communication, but rather a visual system that represents the actual properties of spoken human languages.As I explained in a previous answer (When did the oldest written language start as compared to the oldest spoken language?), true writing evolved first among the Sumerians only after a period of pictograph-like signs that represented tokens for trade came to acquire determinatives that represented actual grammatical formatives in speech. As I mentioned in that answer, "the earliest proto-cuneiform signs lacked these properties [of case, number, person, etc]: they were merely signs that represented things in the world such as animals, people and certain abstractions like number and size". As Denise Schmandt-Besserat put it,[B]efore the invention of writing, compositions typically consisted of geometric or animal motifs that were juxtaposed, dovetailed together, orplaced in rotating arrangements that symbolized an idea or evoked a story. But after writing, as the process of copying the dispositions of signs on a tablet was introduced, Near Eastern art became linear and thus could tell a story. [When Writing Met Art]All this is missing in the Gbekli Tepe pictographs. There are clearly pictures of vultures, scorpions and other entities, but these do not constitute writing, at any level, because they merely evoke a narrative that involves vultures and scorpions and do not actually tell what role those vultures and scorpions had. No one doubts that the people who built Gbekli Tepe were anatomically and behaviorally modern (see Behavioral modernity) but writing requires more than that.  Language is not the same as communication, and pictorial representation is not the same as writing.
