 There probably is some truth to this claim, but it mostly boils down to what dialect of a language you've been most exposed to. The dialects of colonial languages that formed in the Western Hemisphere in the last 400-500 years have a few things in common:They were not drawn from a single source dialect in their respective mother-countries, but rather from a large variety of different, sometimes only partially intelligible dialects. This resulted in Koineization, or flattening out, of the differences between dialects that resulted from a linguistic bottleneck:Here, a linguistic bottleneck is analogous to a biological genetic bottleneck: a speciation event occurs (such as migration) that results in a smaller set of features (here, features of a dialect) than in the original population. This new subset is not necessarily 'simpler' (as in the chart), just less diverse.In comparison to their mother countries, these dialect regions were all formed very very quickly: it took a mere 250 years for English to spread from Virginia to California. Compare that to the British Isles, where English did not really begin to replace Celtic languages in Scotland and Ireland for more 800-1000 years after it first showed up there.A corollary of that is that these dialect regions are very big: English across most of North America, Spanish all the way from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego, Portuguese from the Atlantic almost to the Andes. This all means that it is less necessary to adjust multimedia broadcasts for local differences than it would be in any of the mother countries.These three facts have the result that the internal markets of these speaker communities are both vaster and more uniform than any of the other regions across the pond. As a consequence, more people learning Spanish, Portuguese or English are exposed to these new dialects than to their Old World varieties for simple economic reasons. It has nothing to do with the inherent properties of the dialects in question; only the amount of internal diversity.
