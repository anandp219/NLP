 If depends on how you do the counting. In some languages with alphabets, like English, French and German, digraphs and trigraphs are not counted toward the total number of letters in the alphabet. English has a total of 36-37 phonemes in most dialects -- 24 consonants and 12 or 13 vowels -- but has to make do with a measly 26 letters to represent those distinctive sounds graphically. In other languages, such as Spanish, digraphs are actually treated as distinct letters and words are alphabetized accordingly: a word that begins with <ch> goes toward the end of the dictionary in Spanish, not the beginning, as in English. So, if we include these latter kinds of languages, then surely Abkhaz beats most languages: it has a total of 58 phonemes in the literary language, and uses a variant of the Cyrillic alphabet with 64 letters.As you can see, like Spanish, Abkhaz systematically uses digraphs to represent particular phonetic properties: the schwa makes the preceding graph labialized, while the soft sign  indicates a palatalized consonant. These additional diacritic characters are essential to Abkhaz writing because of how many different distinctions in the sound-system are reliant upon it. Like Spanish, these digraphs are also alphabetized differently than the letters separately. Even without these digraphs, Abkhaz has some 41 letters, more than most written languages.Abkhaz is a language that has a fairly serious amount of writing in it. However there might be one language that beats Abkhaz -- the Taa language of Botswana and Namibia. This click language has been estimated to have as many as 87 consonant phonemes, 20 vowel phonemes, and two tones. Linguists argue about how many of these are actually consonant clusters, but few doubt that it is the language with the largest phoneme inventory in the world. Despite this, most Taa speakers are not literate in their own language, and there is no tradition of using a practical orthography for writing Taa, so it is not clear that Taa actually beats Abkhaz in the number of letters in a writing system.
