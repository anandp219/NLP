 In linguistics, the terms finite and nonfinite (usually without a hyphen) refer to an entirely different domain of language than the term infinite. As I mentioned in a previous answer (What is the difference between a finite verb and a nonfinite verb?), finite and nonfinite are morphological aspects of verbal paradigms: a nonfinite verb form lacks overt marking for features like person, number and tense that a finite verb has (i.e. it is not 'limited' by them). Thus the difference between the two terms depends on the shape of the verb.Infiniteness in language is something altogether different. In linguistics, infinite refers to the fact that natural languages are syntactically recursive, meaning the rules can apply to their own output:This property of syntax leads to discrete infinity, since the set of such sentences is infinite (even though each of those individual sentences is itself of finite length).Thus, nonfinite and infinite are both technical terms that have different but important nonoverlapping meanings in linguistic theory because of the domain they apply to.
