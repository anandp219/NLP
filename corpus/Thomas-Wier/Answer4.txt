 In essence, it's because the exact conditions under which Germans arrived in the United States were very different from those which modern Hispanics find in the American Southwest. As I noted in another answer (Given that the United States is a nation of immigrants, how did the English language come to dominate the nation?), the first English settlers created a founder effect (Founder effect) on language use within the colonies:A founder effect results from an expansion of a diverse population into new areas, resulting in lower differential diffusion of features in those new areas.German settlers arrived late (the earliest small groups coming only in the 1680s or so), and tended to arrive in small groups of individuals or small families, only rarely creating large self-contained colonies. By the time that Germans started to come in large numbers, in the mid-19th century, there were already millions of English speakers throughout the eastern part of North America into which they could be quickly assimilated.The situation with Hispanics was very different, almost the reverse. English speakers arrived in the Southwest very late -- the first came to the easternmost areas of Texas only in the early 19th century, about three centuries after the Spanish-speakers did. Although there were not huge numbers of Hispanics in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona or California at that time (see also my answer: If Texas is a former Mexican state, how come Spanish isn't the main language used in Texas?), they continued to outnumber English speakers for a number of decades, until the mid to late 19th century. To this day, some parts of the Southwest are still overwhelmingly Spanish-speaking; Laredo, TX, e.g. is 92% Hispanophone. Thus Kelly Martin's answer is only partially correct: the continued use of German faced a host of sociolinguistic difficulties long before the 20th century's worldwars made Germans social pariahs.
