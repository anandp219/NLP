 No, (pace Lee Ballentine and Alan Dawkins) it is not true, for two reasons:(1) In English, not all Latin-derived words retain their original Latinate plural endings. Thus scientific words like antenna can have a plural antennae (alongside the Anglo-Saxon antennas, with different meanings attached to the distinct plurals), and a Kulturwort like forum can sometimes (in highstyle) take a Latinate plural fora, but the vast majority of Latin words directly imported into English do not retain their Latinate plurals. Thus abacus, abdomen, apex, creditor, geranium, iris, museum, ratio, Sphinx, and virus do not become abaci, abdomines, apices, creditores, gerania, irides, musea, rationes, Sphinges and viri.(2) Even in Latin, the plural of penis is not penii, but penes. In Latin, the word originally meant 'tail', and like almost all third declension nouns, the -is suffix in the nominative singular becomes the an -es suffix in the nominative plural.
