 These are two very different questions. For the first, there is a (somewhat) clear answer; for the second, there is no answer because the question relies on the false assumption that spoken languages can have a certain age.Writing is not just symbolism...The earliest form of (proto-)writing comes from Mesopotamia, and did not burst into existence full-fledged, but evolved over a period of many centuries from earlier forms of pictographic and symbolic communication systems. The best work on this was done by the art historian Denise Schmandt-Besserat, who showed in a series of engaging works that writing arose in Mesopotamia as a by-product of accounting systems. These early accounting systems used physical tokens to keep track of goods and services, often rather abstract ones like spheres and cones:(From her work When Writing Met Art)Over time, to increase the security of transactions, these tokens were kept in clay envelopes, which when broken revealed the contents of the deal. Later, these envelopes were stamped with indications of the contents. It was eventually realized that these stamps could in fact entirely replace the tokens inside, and proto-writing was born. [1]However, such pictographic systems differ from true writing systems in that true writing systems reflect actual features of spoken language, including aspects of word-order, case-marking, verb agreement and other aspects of natural languages that do not exist in other symbolic communication systems. The earliest proto-cuneiform signs lacked these properties: they were merely signs that represented things in the world such as animals, people and certain abstractions like number and size. As Schmandt-Besserat put it,[B]efore the invention of writing, compositions typically consisted of geometric or animal motifs that were juxtaposed, dovetailed together, orplaced in rotating arrangements that symbolized an idea or evoked a story. But after writing, as the process of copying the dispositions of signs on a tablet was introduced, Near Eastern art became linear and thus could tell a story. [When Writing Met Art]An example of this is the Kish Tablet, found in the Sumerian city of Kish and dated to ca. 3500 BC:The Kish TabletOn this tablet, there is only an evocation of a narrative (of some kind); there is no true telling of that narrative, since there is no way to relate signs to fully inflected spoken words. It was only some centuries after this that cuneiform became unequivocally a form of writing, in the Jemdet Nasr period ca. 3200 BC. Proto-hieroglyphic forms of Egyptian started to be attested around the same time, 3100 BC. ...and Not the Same as LanguageWriting is different from spoken language in many ways. First, spoken language is an evolved feature of the human species: there are no humans that do not speak in some kind of language. Humans appear to be genetically programmed to acquire language, and all humans will do so automatically without training as long as they are exposed to speech before the onset of puberty. Writing is different, in that humans have to be trained to use writing in the same way that they have to be trained to look both ways before crossing the street, or trained how to use a knife and fork to eat. It is in other words a qualitatively different kind of cultural practice.Rather than just some skill we acquire like learning to tie our shoelaces, a better way to think about spoken language is as a biological trait that has been characteristic of humans for hundreds of thousands of years. As with biological species, it is not sensible to ask when a particular language evolved, because all languages have evolved continuously for an equally long time from the first proto-language that came into being perhaps some quarter-million years ago (see my answer: When did language originate?). And indeed: this first proto-language harkens back to even earlier pre-linguistic forms of communication similar to those used by other species of ape. There has thus never been any one point in time when a given language categorically changed from Language A to Language B: linguistic change is not discrete like that.However, if we must compare the ages of writing and of speech, then something like the modern human language faculty has been in use for far, far longer than writing: 99% of the time speech has been around, writing has not.[1] In some places, other motives than economics might have been at work. The oracle bone scripts of China, for example, while not examples of true writing, probably had primarily or exclusively religious usages at first.
