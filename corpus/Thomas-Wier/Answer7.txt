 Unless you are not a native speaker of English, there's no sense in talking about 'recommending' how to speak, since all native English speakers speak (their own form of) English correctly, ipso facto. Some native speakers use themself as the reflexive form of (singular) they, while others (including me) use themselves for reflexive they, whether singular or plural reference. However, it's worth pointing out that this reflexive form of singular they is directly analogous to other originally plural pronouns that are used as singulars. The pronoun you historically was exclusively plural (the singular was thou); when thou disappeared and you filled its place, the reflexive form was originally generally yourselves, even when it had singular reference:As you can see in this chart, starting in the mid 18th century, you in its singular sense acquired a distinctly singular reflexive pronoun yourself (though this had actually been knocking around for a number of centuries, it was not generalized). Likewise, other pronouns like we sometimes had singular reference, and developed singular reflexive pronouns as a result. Thus a monarch might use ourself when using the royal we, such as this note to Parliament by King Charles II in 1662:Certainly, if a king said it, it must be grammatical, right? In any event, by analogy, what we are seeing with themself is the extension of a pronominal paradigm to keep up with the reality of reference in the language.
