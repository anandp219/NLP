 The short answer is yes: many languages that have more than three genders have special genders that distinguish domesticated from wild animals, or edible food from inedible vegetation, or the like. (More than three genders? Yes: see my previous answers: Are there languages that have more than three grammatical genders? and Is gender in a language a misleading word?)As I noted in previous answers, gender in language is simply one way of dividing the world up into categories of things, so it should not be surprising that food, which is important in all human societies, ranks among the categories most frequently marked in language gender systems. Among the Ngangikurrunggur (an aboriginal language of Australia), nouns get divided into nine different genders depending on a combination of what marker they have on the noun (1), how possessive adjectives are formed (2), and what marker surfaces on adjectives (3):(source: Corbett, Gender, p. 140)As you can see, two of the nine genders are wholly dedicated to food sources, and several of the others also indirectly refer to food acquisition (weapons and tools help in food acquisition and processing, dogs help track down and seize prey). Other languages that single out different kinds of food sources in different genders:The Papuan language Yimas has some 11 noun genders, of which one is semantically defined by higher animals (like cassowaries, crocodiles and the like), and another one is defined by important plants, like sago palms or coconut palms. (Most of the genders in this language are purely phonologically defined by the ending of the noun.) [1]The Australian language Warndarang has five genders in the singular, including one for plants with edible underground parts; one for trees; and one for large animals. [2]Another Australian language Gurrgoni has four genders, one for 'masculines', one for 'feminines', one for vegetables, and one for all remaining nouns. [3]One of the Yimas People.

In the Algonquian language Meskwaki, there are only two genders: animate and inanimate. Assignment to these two genders is very largely predictable based on the meaning of the noun -- living things are animate, nonliving things are inanimate -- but in a few liminal cases there is variation. Thus large animals such as buffalo which are typically food sources are assigned to the animate gender, while smaller animals can often be assigned to the inanimate gender. [4]So indeed, there is some generalization: languages do tend to 'genderize' the kinds of foods that are important to them, and they do tend to distinguish between protein sources and sources of carbohydrates.[1] also Corbett, Gender, p. 56[2]-[3]: Dixon, Australian Languages, p. 473 and p. 482.[4] Dahlstrom, Ms., A Grammar of the Meskwaki Language.
