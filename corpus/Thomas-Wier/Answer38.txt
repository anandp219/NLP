 Yes, though such languages are considerably rarer than languages which have no gender in the first or second person (like English or French), which in turn are rarer than languages which show no gender distinctions in pronouns at all, the overwhelming majority at 70%:  WALS map illustrating gender distinctions in pronounsAfrica is the continent where gender in pronouns is most frequent, and it is also the continent where gender is most frequently found in the first and second person. For example, according to Anna Siewierska citing work done by the Khoisanist Tom Gldemann and colleagues, in the language Korana (a central Khoisan language spoken in South Africa), gender is found in almost all pronouns, the most in any known language:This language has three genders: masculine, feminine and common. It also has three numbers: singular, dual and plural. The only pronouns that do not have common gender are logically enough the first and second persons -- people rarely talk to inanimate objects, and inanimate objects rarely speak up for themselves. (NB that the peculiar character ||' in the third person is a glottalized lateral click, an approximation of which you can hear pronouned here: Click consonant.) Korana is something of an outlier linguistically. However even Korana's system is not as unusual as those few languages which have gender only in the first or second person, and not the third. One such language is the Cushitic language Iraqw, which contrasts gender in the second person, but not the first or third:This statistical rarity may be seen against the larger pattern across languages, that there is a typological scale ranking first and second person over third: 1, 2> 3.
