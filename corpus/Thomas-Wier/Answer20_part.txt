 The short answer is that Georgian and Ossetian belong to totally unrelated language families, use largely unrelated lexicons, and have rather dissimilar grammatical systems.One of the big problems that students of Caucasian languages face is what you might call the Orientalist Fallacy: speakers of Caucasian languages 'over there' have been living next to each other, speaking each other's languages for centuries or millennia, so they must be pretty similar, right? Georgians and Ossetians share many traits in common: marriage customs, culinary traditions, modes of dress, styles of architecture, rules of hospitality (and contrariwise, blood vendettas), and all sorts of other cultural habits, so it is very easy to assume their languages must go along for the ride. Here for example are two old pictures of men in traditional dress, both holding a gun and wearing Chokhas: a western Georgian (on the left) and an Ossetian (on the right) -- can you spot the difference?Superficially, especially from the vantage point of the Moskva River or the Seine, Georgians and Ossetians can seem to be practically identical.Phylogenetic DifferencesBut the first major problem with that view is that, linguistically, Georgian and Ossetian belong to two entirely unrelated language families: Kartvelian and Indo-European (on its Iranian branch), respectively. Although the Kartvelian languages have been situated in the Caucasus since time immemorial (at least the early Bronze Age), the Ossetians arrived there in classical antiquity as an off-shoot of an eastern subbranch of the Iranian family within Indo-European -- Ossetian is specifically most closely related to Yaghnobi, a language spoken in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan. They are in fact the last remnants of the ancient Scythian nomads who roamed the western and central steppe more than two thousand years ago. So despite centuries of geographic proximity, they originally come from totally different parts of Eurasia, which you can see on this map. (Here, Georgia is in the left corner, with the capital labeled 'Tiflis', near the current Ossetic speaking region, while Yagnobi is far to the east near Dushanbe.)Grammatical (In)congruitiesIn many ways, Ossetic has drifted far from its IE origins. Unlike most other IE languages but like Georgian, Ossetic has lost all grammatical genders. Ossetic has also entirely lost its original IE case paradigm system, in which suffixes combined number and case in a single affix. Ossetic has instead innovated an almost entirely new system with a discrete number suffix followed by one of nine case suffixes (again, mostly unknown in IE). Here for example is the paradigm for 'house' (with the Georgian equivalent for comparison):Ossetic Singular PluralNominative xzar xzar-tt- 'house/houses'Genitive xzar-y xzar-tt-y Dative xzar-n xzar-tt-n Allative xzar-ma xzar-tt-amAblative xzar-y xzar-tt-yInessive xzar-y xzar-tt-ySuperessive xzar-yl xzar-tt-ylEquative xzar-aw xzar-tt-aw Comitative xzar-ima xzar-tt-imaGeorgianNominative saxl-i saxl-eb-i 'house/houses'Narrative saxl-ma saxl-eb-maDative saxl-s saxl-eb-sGenitive saxl-is saxl-eb-isInstrumental saxl-it
