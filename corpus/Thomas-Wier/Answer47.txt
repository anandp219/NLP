 There are actually a lot of cultural differences that most people don't know about -- Louisiana is profoundly different from Virginia, and eastern Oregon might as well be Montana. Collin Woodard wrote about these cultural differences in his book American Nations, a history of 11 Rival Regional Cultures of North America. But rather than just tell you to read that (which you should) I'll go with a nonobvious difference that's pretty identifying: language.Despite the fact that America is a pretty young country, and does not have nearly as much linguistic variation as Great Britain, dialectology does a pretty good job of identifying where you're from. Bert Vaux and Josh Katz came up with a great dialect quiz that uses 25 linguistic isoglosses (roughly, dialect features distinctive to particular regions) that, when overlaid each other, gives a pretty accurate assessment of where you grew up (if you stayed in one place anyway). You can take that quiz here, and it will make you a personalized dialect map: The New York TimesIn my case, it guessed pretty closely that I grew up in Texas, though I'm actually from Houston not the Dallas-Fort Worth area:Actually, Houston dialect is kinda a mix of upper Southern and Deep Southern -- it stands right at the border -- so it's not surprising that the algorithm would identify some Deep Southern aspects of my speech, though no one would guess I'm even from the South based on the way I talk.
