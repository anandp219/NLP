 An inquorate gender is a gender (or noun class) in a language that is closed, in that new members cannot or cannot easily be added, andhas very few members, generally less than one or two dozen.Maybe the most famous example of inquorate genders comes from the language Tsova-Tush (aka Batsbi). In this language, there are five productive noun genders (five? yes, see my earlier answer: Are there languages that have more than three grammatical genders?) and three genders that have only a small number of nouns. But to see that you first have to understand how gender works in Tsova-Tush. Like other Nakh-Daghestanian languages, verbs agree with the gender of the subject (if intransitive) or object (if transitive), and the agreement depends on the specific combination of markers in the singular and in the plural:Thus, to say 'the boy is', you say k'nat va; but to say 'the boys are', you say k'nati ba. This is because the noun k'nat belongs to the first gender, while other nouns have different patterns of agreement. 'The bear is' and 'the bears are' would thus respectively be a ba and ar da. It is thus the specific combination of exponents -- actual affixes -- that determines which gender any given noun belongs to. The problem with this is that, for the analyst, it seems to be missing a generalization that the last three of these genders, genders VI, VII and VIII, only consist of a small number of nouns -- 25 total for those three combined -- and they might better be listed as lexical exceptions in the grammar.
