 If you're looking for books that exclusively discuss Nakh mythology, then there really aren't that many out there, since most studies that include Nakh myths more broadly discuss the Caucasus as a whole. However, I would start with:The Aboriginal Religions of the Chechens and Ingush, by B. K. Dalgat. First published in 1893, there hasn't been anything comparably focused on just the religious beliefs of the Nakh peoples since.Then there are other more general texts about the Chechens and Ingush, including:Jaimukha's Chechens: a Handbook, which broadly discusses the history and culture of the Chechens as a people;Matveena's The North Caucasus: Russia's Fragile Borderland;Smith's Allahs Mountains: The Battle for Chechnya.Ilyasov's "The Diversity of the Chechen Culture: From Historical Roots to the Present"One website that is updated fairly regularly that covers ethnographic, linguistic and anthropological facts about various Caucasian peoples is that of my friend and ethnographer Alexander Bainbridge, batsav | home. There you can find quite a bit about North Caucasian peoples, including the following information drawn mostly from out-of-print sources: the pagan religious practices of the chechens and the ingush.vainakh deitiesvainakh legends
