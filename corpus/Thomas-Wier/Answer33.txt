 That's because when Rome withdrew its legions from a territory, it didn't always withdraw the Latin-speaking colonies it had settled there beforehand. Although there are still fierce disputes within Balkan linguistics about exactly what relationship the modern Romanians have the ancient Latin colonies in the Balkans, what is totally clear is that most of Romania was within the uppermost limit of Romanization south of the Carpathian mountains ca. the 6th century:As you can see, in the 6th century, an entire swath of territory stretching from the Adriatic to the Black Seas and from the Carpathians to the Danube had already become Latin speaking. Later, the creation of a distinct 'Romanian' ethnolinguistic group arose because waves of Slavs, Hungarians, Turks and even Aryans (related to the Ossetians) invaded the Balkans and assimilated parts of the Romance-speaking world to their own languages, and cut them off from each other. Thus the Romanians are the remnant of a once much larger Eastern Romance linguistic sphere.There is another point to be made here though, and this is that when we say a language is a Germanic language or a Romance language, we are not talking about properties the language has today, but rather about the historical evolution of that language. No matter how much Romanian changes in the future, Romanian will always remain a Romance language because it began as a dialect of Latin.
