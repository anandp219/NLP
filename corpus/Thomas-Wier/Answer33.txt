 As Mark Mandel says, the question is not one that can be answered discretely because there is no discrete number at which one speaks 'many' languages. This is because the word 'many' is rather vague: it constitutes an example of the Sorites paradox ('how many grains of sand do you need to pile up until you have a heap?'):(An image of a heap of grains of sand: where does the heap begin?)But there is another reason, and this is that what constitutes many languages in one culture might be rather few languages in another culture. As I noted in a previous answer, in the Vaupes region of the Amazon, knowing five or more languages is actually a must, since you can only get married to someone who speaks a different language: How many languages is too many for a small child to be learning at once? In such a culture, knowing only three languages would not make people think you are particularly polyglottal.
