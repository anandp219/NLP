 and 'take something'. But it's even more complicated when you look at the full paradigms of some of these verbs. Consider the future paradigms of 'go away' vs. 'go (about)': SG PL SG PL(2) 1 mi-val  mi-val-t da-v-i-vl-i da-v-i-vl-i-t 2 mi-x-val mi-x-val-t da-i-vl-i da-i-vl-i-t 3 mi-va mi-vl-en da-i-vl-is da-i-vl-ian 'I will go off, you etc.' 'I will go about, you etc.'Here, the root in just one form -- the third person plural of 'go off' -- is used for the entire paradigm of 'go (about)', so that one verb is regular, while another is irregular. Also, like the English example above, all of these roots, in both verbs, are historically related, even though they now are frozen in particular forms in particular parts of the paradigm. What this illustrates is irregularity is a feature of how cells in paradigms relate to each other, not features of particular roots.There is some evidence however that at least some of these suppletive roots are in fact not the same verb (sharing a paradigm) at all. An example from the chart above is the verb 'carry', which has a dative-case subject in the present tense, but a nominative case subject in the future and a narrative case subject in the aorist past tense:(3) a. Ivane-s mi-a-kv-s c'ign-i samk'itxelo-i John-DAT PVB-PRV-have.INAN-3sg carry-NOM reading.room-to 'John is carrying the book into the reading room.' b. Ivane mi-i-t'an-s c'ign-s samk'itxelo-i John.NOM PVB-PRV-carry-3sg book-DAT reading.room-to 'John will carry the book into the reading room.' c. Ivane-m mi-i-t'an-a c'ign-i samk'itxelo-i John-NAR PVB-PRV-carry-AOR3sg book-NOM reading.room-to 'John carried the book into the reading room.'In these examples, you can see that the present tense form with the weird case-array (dative subject, nominative object) is actually based on the word for 'have something inanimate', while the other two tenses actually have both different roots and different case marking (nominative subject and dative object, then narrative subject and nominative object). In fact, some speakers also have a regular paradigm for the root t'an- 'carry' in the present tense as well, so what we might have here is in fact two only partially merged verbs: one (kv-) that is defective and uses the other (t'an-) for its other tenses, and one that is fully formed (t'an-). So although Georgian case marking is totally strange if you compare it to other languages, these forms are strange even in comparison to other Georgian forms. Georgian is an exceptionally complicated language morphologically, but an even more striking example from the Caucasus is Udi, spoken in Azerbaijan and in a few villages in Georgia. In this language, it is no longer easily possible to form new verb roots. To form new verbs, instead you take a noun and then use one of thirty or so light verbs that are bleached of their meaning (much like when English speakers say 'do homework'). The nouns are incorporated into the verb, but are still morphologically distinct from them. What's interesting is that a number of these light verbs have suppletive stems in different tenses:(Udi data take from Harris' Endoclitics and the origins of Udi Morphosyntax; table mine)The implication of this is that, since new verb meanings have to be composed of light verbs, and since some light verbs have suppletive forms, new verbs in this language are indirectly systematically suppletive -- in effect, regularly irregular. This is truely fascinating, and one of the reasons I continue to study the languages of the Caucasus.
