 Definite articles like the mark noun phrases as identifiable to the reader/hearer. Contrary to some other answers here and what you may have learned in school, it is quite possible for definite noun phrases to be nonspecific, and even nonexistent (or in linguist's parlance, nonreferential). Both of these are at play in a sentence like "The unicorn is an imaginary animal". In that sentence, the use of the reflects an entire category of beast which, despite not referring to a specific instance of an animal, is assumed to be identifiable to the hearer (we all read or heard about unicorns as children, even though we've obviously never seen one). An early modern depiction of a unicorn. It is still grammatical to refer to "the unicorn" as a class of animal, even though it does not in fact exist.Different languages with definite articles have different rules of use. Thus in German and Greek, it is quite grammatical to mark proper names with a definite article even though proper names always have unique referents: Die Sabine hab' ich gestern gesehen. In English and many other languages with definite articles, on the other hand, this is quite ungrammatical: *I saw the John yesterday. So the usage of articles is not determined by the semantic meaning of a phrase, but by the structure of a discourse, and the rules for encoding that discourse are language specific.
