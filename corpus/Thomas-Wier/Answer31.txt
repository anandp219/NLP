 I'm going to plunk for a slightly different answer than the one Kevin Flint chose: not the first person who left Africa, but the most recent common ancestors of us all, Y-chromosomal Adam and Mitochondrial Eve. These are of course not the Biblical Adam and Eve, but two real human individuals from whom all modern humans descend, who lived between 200k and 350k years ago.The reason I don't think the actual migration is so important is that members of the genus Homo have left Africa several times in the last 2 million years (the first left evidence in the Republic of Georgia 1.77m years ago). Even anatomically modern humans have probably gone back and forth across the Africa-Asia divide countless times, so I think the criterion of "the first person who started off for Asia" is not one that singles out a unique individual, or at least not one that we can actually identify. Here for example is a photograph I personally took of the archaeological site in Dmanisi, Republic of Georgia, where they found an astounding five Homo erectus skulls, the most ever found at one site:(Pit in Dmanisi where the H. erectus skulls were found. The layer where they found it is in the exact middle of this photo where you can still animal bones spilling out of the excavation layer.)A more impressive idea for me is the Y-chromosomal Adam, from whom all modern men are descended. Or the Mitochondrial Eve, from whom all men and women are descended. Both of these individuals lived around 200k-350k years ago, and they engaged in a lifestyle that was not noticeably different from their forebears hundreds of millennia before, and their descendents for thousands of years afterward. They had mastery of fire and tool-use and, I would assert, something resembling modern language (with open-ended lexicons and potentially hierarchical syntax -- see my answer to When did language originate?). But they did not as far as we can tell engage in fishing, create composite tools, make figurative art on cave walls or decorate their bodies, or have regionally distinctive cultures of artifact creation -- they were not, in other words, behaviorally modern (Behavioral modernity). In many ways, these two individuals would be very foreign to us -- they would resemble us perfectly in a physical sense, but their behaviors would be difficult to recognize. They probably did not know each other -- they almost certainly did not live at the same time -- but they are literally part of every man, woman and child in (pre)history. From this they have achieved a kind of immortality that no one human has ever achieved, or is likely to in the future.
