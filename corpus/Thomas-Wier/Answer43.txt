 The oldest attestation of a form of something that might be called English is the almost unintelligible inscription on the Undley Bracteate, a single-sided golden medal that bore an inscription in Anglo-Frisian Futhorc runes, which dates to the 5th century:The bracteate features an image of a Romulus and Remus being suckled by the she-wolf with an image of a Roman Emperor (probably Constantine the Great). The inscription reads:ggog mg meduThis has been interpreted to mean 'she-wolf' (ggog, presumably imitative of the cry of a wolf) and 'mead for kinsmen' (mg medu), a reference to the bracteate itself being given as a gift. This form of English is so old that it is not even clear if we should call it English, since it was probably manufactured by someone in what is now Denmark and who emigrated to Britain at the very earliest period of Angl0-Saxon settlement around the year 450 or somewhat later. But of course, at this earliest period, there had been no time for Anglo-Saxon speech to diverge from the forms of speech in the 'old country' on the Continent. This is thus somewhat like the equivalent of finding an inscription on a tool that had been left behind by the Pilgrims on the Mayflower.
