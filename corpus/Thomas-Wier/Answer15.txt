 Far from it.  One problem with this question is that the word 'nation' necessarily implies some form of common ethnic identity, and the great empires of Rome, China and Persia definitely did not have common ethnic identities. Even ignoring this complication though, there were quite a few other major, and dozens of minor, kingdoms, republics and empires around the world, not to mention thousands of tribal societies. Here's just a selection from the eastern hemisphere ca 100 AD:So, to be sure, Rome and China were superpowers, and Persia and to a lesser extent Axum were powers of the middle rank, but there were others that should have their due.
