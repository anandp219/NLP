 I've already discussed some of the features of Georgian that make it unusual: What are the characteristics of the Georgian language? Those structural properties can be summarized as:Exhorbitant consonant clusters, both quantitatively and qualitatively more complex than almost any other language, make simple articulation of the language difficult;The polysynthetic verb morphology with subject and object agreement is complicated, but the way in which specific affixes compete for realization on the verb (see my other answer for details) is highly unusual and counterintuitive from a typological perspective;The system of case assignment, in which the case of the subject changes from one tense to the next (nominative in the present and future, narrative in the aorist, dative in the evidential perfect) is not just conceptually hard to grasp, but it makes language learning difficult because different conjugations of verbs have different patterns, so for each verb you have to learn which of the four major patterns it takes.Some of the most frequent and necessary word forms are not only irregular but also highly counterintuitive, which means you have to learn them early along with the more straightforward parts of the grammar. For example, the verb 'to have' seems like it should be very basic, but you need to know that it takes a dative case subject that agrees with what look like object prefixes, a nominative case object that agree with subject suffixes, and you also need to know whether the possessee is animate or inanimate, because there are two entirely different verbs for 'have' that depend on that fact. Also, these two verbs use different irregular stems in every tense, so they require a lot of memorization.Although the last two centuries has seen a rush of western loan words, the vast majority of Georgian words are still pretty foreign-looking to westerners. And even when Georgians borrow a western word, they often have an indigenous word that is quite opaque: cf. int'ernacionaluri 'international' vs. saertaoriso 'international' (< er-ta oris 'between peoples').So there are a lot of basic structural facts about the language that make it hard to learn even before you think about language pedagogy. But there are other facts about the way the Georgian language is taught and spoken that make it hard:Although the writing system is straightforwardly phonemic, using an alphabet with 33 letters, those letters do not look anything like more familiar Latin, Greek or Cyrillic letters. On top of that, many of the individual letters look very similar, with no less than 8 letters that look vaguely like the numeral '3':  /v/,  /k'/,  /p'/,  /h/,  /q'/,  /p/,  /g/,  /ts/.Very few teachers of the language are nonnative speakers, and this has the implication that when you are first taught the language, you are being taught by people who have solid intuitions about the language, but who never had to learn the language consciously. This means that most teachers of Georgian don't really understand what features of the language are not intuitive for foreigners.Most Georgian language textbooks rely on outdated understandings
