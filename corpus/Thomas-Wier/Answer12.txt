 No. But: when you're discussing the linguistic history of a country with a documented history of about three or four millennia, all sorts of things have happened, so you have to be specific about which time period you're talking about. The people who wrote works like this:(Safavid miniature of a work by Nizami)Were not the same people who wrote works like this:(The Caucasian Albanian alphabet)As I discussed in my answer "What is the history of Azerbaijan, it's people and culture?", many different languages have been (and indeed still are) spoken in Azerbaijan, with the following languages having been dominant in roughly the following order:Caucasian Albanian (aka Old Udi) -- the ancestor of the modern Udi language (ca. 3000 BC - ca. 1500 BC, and again from around the first century AD until the 9th or so)Some form of Indo-Iranian (ca. 2000 BC -- 500 BC), which evolved into numerous offshoot languages of Azerbaijan including:  proto-Tat, the language of Baku in the 19th century; and proto-Talysh.Later, and outside Azerbaijan Proper, various forms of Persian became very influential as a result of the various Persian Empires (Achaemenid, Parthian, Sasanian, Safavid, etc.)Starting in the 11th century, Oghuz Turkic migrations into the region gradually altered its ethnolinguistic balance and language shift began toward a form of Turkic.The later form of Persian, not native to Azerbaijan itself, influenced all the arts and literature of the region, including Nizami in Ganja and Rustaveli in Georgia. Nizami himself was of mixed Persian/Kurdish background (his father was probably from Qom, but his mother was Kurdish).But in any event the answer is no, because there have always been speakers of other languages in Azerbaijan, and Persian was only ever at some points one among many, and a foreign interloper at that.
