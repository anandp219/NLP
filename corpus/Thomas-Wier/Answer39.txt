 Normally when linguists count the number of pronominal distinctions, they are interested in basically three features: person, number and clusivity. (The third might be considered a subclass of the first.) In many languages, pronouns inflect for other features, such as case, gender, alienability, visibility and even geographical elevation (as in some languages of Daghestan) but these are usually not considered central to linguistic theorizing. (For example, Brian Collins' list of case forms is large compared to English or Chinese, but nothing like the list of case-forms for Tabassaran, which has around 50.)As I mentioned elsewhere (Are there languages which in addition to the singular and plural, have a dual number?), the 'empirical maximum' is probably found in the language Lihir of New Ireland, which has three persons, five numbers and a consistent inclusive/exclusive distinction for a total of 19:However, if we do include the other ancillary features that are found in pronouns, then surely the maximum would be found in the languages of Daghestan. To take Tabassaran as an example, each pronoun would be inflected for most of the 53 cases (in the northern dialects) and two numbers, and four or more genders, plus other relative, interrogative, and other demonstrative pronouns, and tacking on correlatives for good measure, the grand total would easily be above a thousand. However, this is probably less a measure of the language and more a measure of the analyst.
