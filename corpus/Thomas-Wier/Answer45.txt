 Joshua Engel definitely gets it right: English is still fundamentally, functionally a Germanic language. I'd just like to add though a more abstract point, and this is that when we say two languages are related to each other, we are making a claim about their historical phylogeny, that in effect at one point the two language communities spoke the same language. We are not in fact necessarily saying anything about their current functioning today -- their lexicon, their grammar -- at all. (For more on this, see my earlier answer: How close are French and English?) In fact, many languages have borrowed an even larger percentage of their lexicon from other languages. Albanian for example has over the centuries borrowed over 90% of its word-hoard (to use a good Anglo-Saxon word) from Greek, Italian, Turkish and other Balkan languages. In the limit, in cases of extreme contact, languages can even effectively borrow their entire lexicon from other languages -- we call these languages pidgins and creoles. [1] In such languages, there will usually be a lexifier language like English or Portuguese which provides the words, while most or all the grammar will be borrowed from some other language.  Map of pidgin and creole languages around the worldThere are even a few cases of so-called mixed languages, where a language will take, say, all nouns from one language, but take its verbs from a completely different language. This is true of the Michif language of Canada, whose nouns come mostly from French, but whose verb system comes from Cree. The result in this language is that nouns have two genders: masculine or feminine gender from French, but a covert animate/inanimate contrast from Cree (because Cree verbs agree in animacy with their arguments). Such languages tell us a lot about how language itself functions.[1] In fact, 'borrowing' may not be the right word to describe pidginization processes, but lexifier languages usually are 'foreign' to a given region.
