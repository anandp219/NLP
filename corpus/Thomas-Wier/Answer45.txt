 Since 1972, it already has been extinct in the wild, in its original habitat. This was mostly due to poaching. In the last few years up to one thousand individuals have been reintroduced in the Arabian Peninsula, and they are now considered merely vulnerable.However, back in the 1980s, a few hundred Arabian oryxes were imported to Texas, where they now number over ten thousand individuals. The hot dry climate of south and west Texas is highly conducive to these animals, and in some places they are actually becoming an invasive species. Most of these oryxes are on wild game ranches where hunters pay a premium (usually many thousands of dollars) to hunt exotic wild game. This practice is needless to say controversial, but it has been argued that it actually increased the overall size of herds, since ranchers and owners of hunting leases had an incentive to keep herds well-maintained and healthy. Now considerably more oryxes live in Texas than anywhere else in the world. Also as of 2012, the animal has reentered the US government's list of endangered species, meaning that it can no longer be hunted for game. According to Texas Monthly, this has already resulted in dozens of oryxes being sold or slaughtered for wild game hunts: The End of Hunting for Exotic, Endangered Antelopes. A similar plan is afoot to import more than 4% of South Africa's rhinoceroses to Texas where they will not be hunted: As poaching heats up, conservationists advocate sending South Africa rhinos to Texas.For more information on the status of oryxes and other exotic animals in Texas, check out this 60 Minutes episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
