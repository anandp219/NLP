 Yes. Although it's not traditionally considered to be a verbal category in English, inflection for negation is found on certain auxiliary verbs. Doesn't also features inflection for person, number, tense and mood. Here's what I said in my answer to How did "aren't" become the contraction of "am not"?__-N't as a Verb InflectionEnglish is somewhat unusual among European languages in that some English verbs can inflect for negation:can, can'twill, won'tfind, *findn'tHistorically, of course, -n't was simply a reduced form of not, but over the centuries it not only became pronounced differently, it began to be used differently from the non-encliticized, or free, form not. For example:it doesn't always attach to the positive form but sometimes attaches to a different, irregular form (will vs. won't, shall vs. shan't);it doesn't attach to all English verbs, but only to certain auxiliaries: could/couldn't but not regular verbs like anticipate/*anticipaten't or even some auxiliaries like may/*mayn't.it doesn't attach to words that already have clitics: *I'dn't be doing that if I were you.it exhibits unpredictable semantic peculiarities. For example between different negated auxiliaries you can get different scopes of negation: you mustn't go home means that it is the case that you must not go home, while you can't go home means that it is not the case that you can go home.(See the classic Zwicky and Pullum 1983 paper for more about -n't.)
