 While I am loath to call into question Stephen Tempest's interesting summary of the mythopoetic literature on Roman place names, there is a much more realistic answer available: the 'Alba' in 'Alba Longa' does not mean 'white' at all, but is a relic of a (pre-?)Indo-European substrate root for mountain and river place names found across Europe.Across Europe, there are dozens of very ancient place names that begin with Alb-/Alp-:These toponyms typically fall into two different kinds of geographical features: Rivers and bodies of waterHills or mountainsThus among mountains or mountainous regions we find the Alps, the Alban Hills of Rome, Albania, Alba in the Piedmont of Italy, and both Alba and Albany, respectively Celtic and Middle English names for Scotland (rather known for its mountains), and famously Albion as a name for England/Britain. We also find other variations, such as Alm, Austria, where an 'alm' is a word for a mountain pasture. The other common meaning is usually rivers, of which there are many: the Elbe, Alf and Alb rivers in Germany; the Aube in France (< Vulgar Latin *Alba); suffixed forms like Germany's Elber (<*Albira) or Spain's Albuera (< *Albora), or Switzerland's Alvra, and in antiquity another name for the Tiber was Albula (= 'little Alba'). All the variants have /al/ plus a labial consonant, plus possible suffixes. [1]The distribution of these place names seems pretty pan-European, and so it has been speculated that these place names are the last remnants of some pre-Indo-European language. But if so, it is curious that the greatest density of such place names was in formerly Celtic speaking parts of Europe, such as France, Britain, southern Germany, northern Italy, and central Spain. Since it is also found as far south as Rome in Italy, some scholars believe this root was a relic from the remote time when Italic languages and Celtic languages were still one speech community, some 4000 years ago. It's also notable that these two meanings were conflated in one word, though this is no more surprising than any language having homophones, like the multiple meanings of English 'set'.Thus 'Alba Longa' means simply and rather prosaically "tall mountain".[1] Note that not all words that begin with Al- are related to this root. Many Spanish placenames come instead from far more recent Arabic loanwords with the Arabic definite article al- prefixed, such as Albacete, which originally was Al-Basit 'the plain'.
