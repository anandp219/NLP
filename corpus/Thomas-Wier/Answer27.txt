 To get at that, you have to go back a step to answer why genders systems arise in the first place. I've already answered this in other answers:Are there languages that have more than three grammatical genders? What determines the gender of newly invented nouns? Is there any language with gendered pronouns for second person? The short answer is that linguistic gender is not a reflection of biology but simply a way to divide the world up into categories so that you can keep track of pieces of information. Most languages have no gender at all, but even for those that do, having gender in pronouns is just one option. Here e.g. is a WALS map of languages with gender in pronouns:As you can see, most languages in East Asia, North America, South America and some parts of Africa lack gender distinctions in pronouns. This is a case where the fact that European languages are so widely used fools us into thinking that they are the norm, when in fact they are not.
