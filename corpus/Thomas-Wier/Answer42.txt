 Depends on whether you want an 'answer' or the real answer. There are probably dozens of languages with one or fewer (yes, or fewer [1]) speakers left, but the problem comes in identifying them. For the most endangered languages often only very inexact information is available. Often by the time you hear that a language has one speaker left, the language has in fact died -- or on the contrary the people who speak it simply moved from one house to another. If you want an actual list, though, the Ethnologue is usually the best, most reliable source for linguistic demographic data: Ethnologue 15 report of nearly extinct languages. According to this list, there are some 516 languages that are classified as 'nearly extinct', though the list is surely different now, since much of the data comes from the '70s and '80s.Given that somewhere between 50% and 90% of the languages of the world will go extinct in the next century, probably a better way to think about language extinction is not just lists, but what can be done to preserve the knowledge within dying languages for future generations:Document and describe endangered languages in all facets of their use;Enact policies and programs that engender stable bilingualism among members of linguistic minority communities. One way you can do this is highlighting real personal stories that show how meaningful linguistic identities are to the people who hold them, like this story of the last speaker of Wukchumni, Marie Wilcox:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...[1] How can a language have fewer than one speaker? To start with, languages usually undergo obsolescence phenomena, changes to their lexicon and grammar, when few speakers regularly speak the language. This can mean that eventually few speakers in a minority community have a full command of the language.
