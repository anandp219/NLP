 I smile.Sure, it doesn't sound like much and I won't compare it to donating for good causes, but it's something that helps me feel better and it also affects other people, in a positive way. Smiling is a small gesture that doesn't cost anything, is effortless, and is actually really good for you.Personally, when I have a bad day and I don't feel happy or good about myself, a smile from a stranger really helps me. It's like an indirect messaging saying, "Keep holding on and being strong, you're doing just fine. We all go through it, but keep being you and keep thinking positive thoughts." At least that's what a smile means to me.Another thing that I try to do everyday is to compliment at least one person. Look, people have bad days and they fight battles that are unknown to us. Sometimes a simple compliment can make someone feel that they're appreciated. It can make them feel good about themselves. Yes, it's happened to me. Often, I get complimented about my smile or my weight and it makes me feel so good about myself that I stop worrying. It brightens up my day. You never know whose day you'll make better by smiling and complimenting them.
