 I don't think there's an age limit to anything. According to me, you can be sixty years old and party like a college student; at the same time, you can be the same age and study as much as you want to achieve a degree. I think society puts the pressure on us to have our lives figured out by the age of thirty, but that's just not possible. At thirty, that's when our lives are truly starting. We're able to focus on our goals and aspirations, and we can make them reality. Life isn't about going to college, getting a degree, getting a job, and earning money. I think it's much more than that. I think life is about self-realization, understanding who you are and what you truly desire.You often hear about the person who quit their job to travel the world, that's commendable. Having that experience of other cultures can help you understand what you truly want and who you truly are. These experiences help us shape dreams, they help us understand how blessed we are, and help us understand how much we take for granted.Forgiving ourselves for not accomplishing what we dreamt of is a new concept for me. I feel that in life, we go through struggles and hardships to prepare us for what's to come. We always end up doing what we're meant to, and the experiences we've had on the way, shape us for what we're truly meant to be. Usually, it's always better than what we dreamt of.I'm not sure if I really answered the question, I feel I've ventured off topic here, but I hope I made sense.
