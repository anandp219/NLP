 There are many reasons, but I moved here because I wanted more and better treatment options. I've written an answer about that already  Virali Modi's answer to Why would Virali Modi move to India from the US, for medical treatment?.Other than that, I've decided to stay in India because of prospective career in films as an actress and/or model. I've realized that I have better chances of landing a project here in India than I do in the US. Sure, it's a competitive field anywhere I go, but I feel I have an advantage because I'm from the US  so I can play a role of a foreigner if needed, and I have a good hold on Hindi and Gujarati.Other than that, I like staying in India because I feel more comfortable here. I was raised in the US since I was two months old, but I feel more comfortable here than anywhere else. It feels like home. No doubt, I do complain about the rough and bumpy roads, the politics, and the fact that there is no disabled friendly infrastructure, but I love it and it's home.
