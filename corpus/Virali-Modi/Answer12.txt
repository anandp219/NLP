 I met my current partner through shaadi.com. Weirdly enough, he wasn't using his profile when he found me  his dad was. It turned out that his father saw me, called his son over, and told him to talk to me. According to my boyfriend, his dad said that I was pretty, intelligent (based off of my description), and I seemed like a cool person.Well, he expressed and interest in me, but I declined him because of superficial reasons; his pictures on the website were not at all attractive, plus he stays in Africa. A couple of days later, he messaged me on Facebook and we started talking  I had no idea who he was until he told me that I declined him on Shaadi. As you can imagine, I was really embarrassed, but we quickly forgot and instantly clicked.It's going to be two years next month, and he's planning on shifting to Mumbai permanently next year.
