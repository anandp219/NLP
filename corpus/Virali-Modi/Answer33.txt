 My boyfriend, Dhyaan, lives in Zimbabwe. I was fortunate to visit the country this year in May. I may not be able to give you an actual experience of how the country is and what it's like to live there, but from what I've noticed, during my month-long stay, I hope I'm able to paint a picture that's helpful.My boyfriend lives in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, I've noticed that they have to count each and every penny before spending. Dhyaan is a software engineer but works in a steel company as a seller and the head of IT. There is no scope for engineers in that city and he's getting paid much less than he really should. Their household consists of three earners, his mother, his sister, and him. His father wants to work, but because of his health problems, no one is willing to hire him, due to liability issues.Recently, there has been shortage of water, in the neighborhood he stays in. They barely get water for two to three hours per day, the same case for electricity. They have power only for two hours per day. Living in such a warm country, I experienced how difficult it was to function during that time. For internet, he has to buy minutes for 3G which gets used pretty quickly.I asked him what it felt like to live in Harare versus when he was here in Mumbai for a month. He said that he'd rather live and earn in Mumbai, even if he's earning in rupees, rather than live in Zimbabwe were he's earning in dollars. He said that it's terrible living there; they grow most of their own vegetables in fruits in the backyard, but dairy, meats, and grains are something that they have to buy and it becomes difficult when you have to feed a family of four.I know it's not much help, but I hope I was able to provide something worthwhile in this answer.
