 To be honest, I haven't hidden anything from my parents. I realized, at a very young age, that my parents would be the only ones who'd take my side if the world was against me. They'd help me through anything if I told them the whole truth.At a young age I did hide things from my parents, and I paid a price. People were spreading rumors about me that weren't true and I didn't know what to do. It was mainly because I went to a party and had a little too much to drink. I was only fourteen years old and I was rebellious. My mom constantly saw my long face everyday and would ask me why I was upset, but I couldn't tell her.When I finally did, she was upset with me. She shouted, because drinking at such a young age was really unheard of in my family. To be honest, it was stupid of me to do that. After all the waterworks were done, she gave me some advice and I implemented it. Guess what? The rumors died off.That's when she told me, "People in this world are just waiting for a reason to talk about you, put you down, and to hurt you. Not everyone is a well-wisher. You shouldn't trust people so easily. Be yourself and be wise. The only people that'll be there for you are your parents. Dad and I will always be there for you, no matter what. We'll help you through anything, as long as you tell us the truth."From that day on, I've respected her wishes and quickly realized that she was extremely right. They've helped me through so much and are so loving and supportive that I have no reason to hide anything from them. Our family of three shares everything with each other, and when we actually have to keep a secret, it's difficult  really difficult. I wouldn't have it any other way.
