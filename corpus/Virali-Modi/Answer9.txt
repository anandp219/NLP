 Congratulations for your relationship! Long distance relationships are really hard to maintain, I know from experience. I guess your parents are doubtful because LDRs don't usually work out. I suppose they think it won't work out in the end.A word of advice, don't worry so much about this. Keep focusing on your relationship, keep putting effort into it, and keep loving your partner. By making this relationship a success, you'll be able to prove your parents wrong  and they'll be very happy to be proven wrong.
