 I was on my way back to India with a layover in Abu Dhabi. There, I met a lady that stayed in Mumbai, a couple of kilometers away. She was talking to me and asked me about my health and what I do for a living. Suddenly, she whips her son's biodata out and gives it to me. She said, "My son's taking positive living classes and I think the both of you would be a good couple." She gave me her number and asked me for mine  I gave her the wrong number. She said she'd be in contact and would arrange a meeting for us.I got a marriage proposal at a foreign airport.
