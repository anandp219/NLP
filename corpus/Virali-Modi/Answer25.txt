 I ask myself that question everyday. I always wonder how I became so famous. To be honest, I'm not someone extraordinary. I'm a normal girl who had some unfortunate events occur in my life. I think what makes me famous is my never-give-up attitude. Despite being wheelchair bound for about nine years, going through difficult situations, and being betrayed by almost everyone in my life, I've realized that I'm the most important person to me and that I should love who I am, no matter what. Along with that, I think my determination to prove everyone wrong is what is admirable. I'm determined to follow and accomplish my dreams of being an actress, no matter my physical condition.
