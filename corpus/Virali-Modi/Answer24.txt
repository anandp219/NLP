 Here's the thing: Indians have populated the majority of Quora, that's a known fact. There are a couple of things that irk me, which I'd like to mention. There are users on here (not particularly Indian) that ask troll questions, simple questions that can be Googled, questions that are demaning and sexist (which are very, very hurtful and controversial), and ask questions before checking for similar questions. There are also those who write troll answers; the reason I say that the majority of such offences are Indians is because if you check the "collapsed answers", it's mostly filled with collapsed answers of Indians. This ticks me off. Please, read the rules, look at Deepak Mehta's description for an introduction to Quora, it'll really help. Their ignorance is making my feed a nightmare to look at. There are also people who are silent readers. They read, upvote, comment, edit answers and questions, and do the needful in terms of merging questions. I really appreciate you. There are also people who provide answers, most of them are helpful and I think more people should provide more inputs if they're comfortable.I think Indians on Quora is a great idea, we have a place to express ourselves without being judged (hopefully). I think we should be doing more to prevent it from becoming Yahoo Answers.
