 The only time I think about my disability is in regards to accessibility in India. If I want to go somewhere, I have to make sure the place is wheelchair friendly or there will be someone there to help me (if there are stairs). To be honest, my disability doesn't really concern me, I've used it to my advantage. Previously, being on a wheelchair gave me low self-esteem. I realized that I wasn't someone who had issues with my body or myself. I made it a challenge to smile at everyone when going out, and to just be myself. Gradually, my confidence increased, and now my disability just doesn't matter.
