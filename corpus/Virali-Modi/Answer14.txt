 I want fame. I want to be famous, not only for me, but for the people whose voice isn't heard.We have activists and NGOs for every possible cause, even for disability but it isn't as famous as other causes. That doesn't mean it's not important, it just isn't heard as widely as others. I want fame to spread awareness for those whom are disabled. We deserve the proper infrastructure, the community needs understanding, and there needs to be proper awareness.I feel like I'm repeating myself, but this is incredibly important. Maybe even more important than others think.
