 1. When applying mascara to my bottom lashes, I make sure I use the mascara wand to "stamp" my lower lashline so it looks like I used some eyeliner. This trick helps me save time and it gives definition to my lower lashline without using another product.2. If I don't have the blush color I want, I use a lipstick of the same color and apply it to my cheeks like a cream blush. This gives me a luminous finish without having to use an illuminator on my cheeks, plus I can use drugstore lipsticks to achieve the perfect cheek color without spending an excessive amount of money.3. For a quick bun, I gather my hair into a ponytail in my hand, then I twist the hair and loop it around itself on my head and use a hair tie to fasten it. It literally takes one minute.4. For extremely soft feet and hands, I apply a heavy duty moisturizer for dry skin and enclose my feet in thick socks over night. The next morning, I'm left with soft feet and hands. If you don't have a heavy duty moisturizer, vaseline works too.5. For an inexpensive makeup remover, I use baby oil to remove my eye makeup. It's soft on the skin, it breaks down eyeliner and mascara really easily, and it's cheap. You don't have to rub and tug your delicate eye area to get your makeup off.6. To make any lipstick matte, I take a two ply tissue paper, separate it and press on sheet onto my lips, taking a translucent powder, I dust it over the sheet and I get instant matte lips.7. If I don't have an eyeliner available and I wish to define my eyes, I use an angled eyeliner brush and a mascara to line my eyes. I coat the eyeliner brush with mascara and use it to line and define my top lash line. (Do not use this on your water line, it will burn and make your eyes water).
