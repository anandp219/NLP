 In my case, I was betrayed by both of my exes. It didn't take me a long time to get back into a relationship; rather it took me about three to four months.My first ex cheated on me, on my birthday with his friend whom he treated like a sister. My second ex betrayed me by using me for a green card (which he wasn't successful). I guess the betrayal from both of them was what made it easier. Yes, I was hurt and in denial, but I made myself strong. I decided that I deserved much, much better and moved on. I started focusing on myself more than anything. I did the things I loved and had a passion for. I also started making friends around my vicinity and ended up having a good time with them.Gradually, I became normal. I was the new and improved me. I was someone that I was proud of. I learned to love myself even more and became much more confident.
