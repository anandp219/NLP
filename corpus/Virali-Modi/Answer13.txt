 Even inspite of an arranged marriage, your wife picked you. It wasn't forced nor was was she blackmailed into marrying you. Your wife obviously saw something special in you that others couldn't recognize.Do me a favor, why don't you tell your wife everything you said in your description. Let us know what she says. I think she'll be angry at you. She'll be hurt that you think you deserve the mockery and that you're going along with it.Your colleagues have no right to judge your relationship, especially on your looks. You should be proud that you have a beautiful wife who loves and cares for you. You shouldn't be worrying about other people. You also shouldn't be joining in on their mockery of you.
