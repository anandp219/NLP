 No.Everything up until I came out of my coma is still hazy. I don't remember much or anything at all, to be completely honest. I don't remember as vividly as other memories of how I became sick [1]. I don't remember when, how, or why I became comatose. All I do remember is the dream [2] I had during those twenty-three days. The dream I had was what was happening to my body at that exact moment.I don't know if this is the case with all coma patients, but my memory was greatly affected. I still have trouble remembering things. I have a tremendously weak long term memory, but my short term memory is quite good. There are many things that I don't remember from my past  things that happened before I got sick. Even now, I have trouble remembering things, people, names, and incidents.The weird thing about this memory problem is that I'm able to remember traumatic events in my life that caused me grief. I cannot remember good and happy memories.[1] Virali Modi's answer to What does it feel like to survive death?[2] Virali Modi's answer to Do people dream during comas?
