 I started dating an Indian-African online almost two years ago.My boyfriend, Dhyaan and I started dating almost two years ago. I've done online dating before, but this was different. This guy was from Africa, from somewhere that I knew so less of. On top of that, it was online. Dhyaan could've been anyone he wanted to be and things could've ended badly  very badly.Surprisingly, he and his family are the most supportive, encouraging, caring, passionate, and loving people I have ever known (other than my own). Dhyaan taught me about the African culture, things I never thought I'd get to learn and experience; but because of him, I did. I traveled to Zimbabwe in May (2015) too see him and crossed off another country on the map.Dhyaan especially has always been so supportive and loving. He's supported me in everything and anything that I've ever wanted to do. He's helped me with therapy and exercises, he got me motivated to start going to the gym, and he's actually gotten me to eat healthy food (which I'm not a fan of).All I can say is that, I took a big step especially after knowing how horribly my ex-fianc treated me. I met my ex online too, but our families knew each other, so it wasn't that weird; yet it all turned out so, so bad. Dhyaan and I had no common friends or family at the time, yet things have turned out to be so amazing. His family is my family and vice versa for him.
