 I don't work, but I do go for therapy and the gym which equals about eight hours of my life, including traveling time. This might sound corny but I started to watch Friends again, mainly because it makes me laugh and destresses me. I think laughter is the biggest energy drink there is. It's the best way to reenergize yourself.Another thing that helps is to spend time with family. After getting home, I spend time with my parents and talk to my boyfriend; we're people who like to share  maybe even overshare parts of our day, and usually it turns into a laughing contest. Even if there isn't much to talk about, it's nice to have a cup of coffee/tea with each other.The best thing, in my opinion, is to have a home cooked meal. I stay with my parents, so having my mom prepare something with her loving hands always cheers me up and brings me joy. Especially if it's something that's my favorite.TL;DR: Laughter, family, love, and food.
