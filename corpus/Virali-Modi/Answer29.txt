 I'm going through this right now. I confronted one of my friends for being irrational and having a bad attitude. We aren't really, really close, but we were once upon a time. Well, now she and her friends (who are also my friends) have stopped talking to me, because supposedly, I hurt her ego.Yes, I was hurt and upset in the beginning, but I spoke to my mom and she told me to ignore them back, and to not even look at them when you're passing them on the street or see them anywhere. She said they'll automatically starting talking to me in some time, because you aren't affected by their behavior. Well, I've been doing that for the past week now, and it seems to be working. One of the friends from the group has started talking to me whenever she and I would cross paths.If you think you're right, ignore them and live your life as if it doesn't matter if they're ignoring your or not. If you're wrong, apologize once, but if they still have the audacity to ignore you after an apology, you should ignore them too.
