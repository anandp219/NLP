 My family has been through the same thing. Exactly the same thing, there were just different variants. I empathize with you and your family. I know how it feels. I can only tell you how we coped with this, and I hope you're able to find some solace in that.When we found out that everyone was being fake towards us, we limited our relationship with them, after getting separated. It's difficult, especially if you've lived with your immediate family for so long. But here's the thing, we realized that if they didn't care for us, they weren't interested in us, and they had no empathy for us, they didn't belong in our lives. We're much more bigger and better than them, we never faked our emotions, we geniunely loved and cared for them. If they cannot reciprocate those feelings, why should we care?It's tough, I know, but it's the truth. My parents and I are really big on self respect and self worth. I know what I deserve and I don't think anyone deserves taunts, hatred, and disrespect. If you go back to a place where you're not welcome, where people don't care, disrespect you, you're a fool, especially after knowing that they have zero feelings.I can tell you this: after moving out of that house, my parents have had so much more time for me, so much more time for each other, and more time to focus on the things that were/are important. During this time, you need to be strong for your parents and siblings, if you have any. You need to tell them that they deserve more than how your family treated you. Try mending their wounds with love, affection, and laughter. Try paying more attention to making them happy. A happy home is a blessed home.
