 There is zero proof that it did not happen and extensive proof that it did. No need to cite the logic or the thousands of sources, here. Therefore, please be aware that the question itself can be considered offensive to the hundreds of thousands of death camp survivors and liberators that are still alive. There is nothing wrong with someone in a succeeding generation to be shocked and ask whether something is true that occured in the past, but to assume it is not true and then challenge others to proove it, is childish and unbecoming of a true human being or student of history. People who believe things that are not true and then spread such nontruths are called denialists and suffer from a neuroses that somehow allows their "learning" to be filtered and their "knowledge" to be highly selective. They are truly dangerous to society in that they normally have a hidden agenda regarding other false beliefs, and you would be wise to carefully avoid such people.
