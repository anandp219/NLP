 It depends on the religion. Some are worse than others, but in all cases it results from good intentions but a warped understanding of God and his relationship with his offspring. Those of Abrahamic faiths have this (mistaken) notion that their Creator would condemn his Created for capricious reasons, therefore, everyone needs to be "saved" by playing the magical games that assure their getting a pass. It is sad that they believe this, sadder that they miss the greater truths of their own religions that encourage them to love their fellow man rather than judge them, forgive their neighbors rather than see them as condemned, and saddest yet, that they don't realize that it is offensive to be treated this way. So, essentially, the cause of the problem is spiritual arrogance. It is assuming that there is only one path to Truth or God.  People take different paths seeking fulfillment and happiness. Just because they're not on your path doesn't mean they've gotten lost.'...Dalai Lama
