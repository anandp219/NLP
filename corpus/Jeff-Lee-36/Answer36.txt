 You probably can't. The reason you probably can't is because you have an incorrect view of many things. You have a viewpoint regarding the meaning of life, which you are not likely to change. You have an idea of what is good and bad, and not only are you not likely to change, you are probably incorrect, as you are not qualified to have an opinion on what is good or bad if you are unaware of all of the ramifications of an act and if you value what is valueless and do not see the wisdom in certain laws or certain lessons. If you misunderstand cause and effect, you will misunderstand which is which and criticize the path even though it is accomplishing your desired goal.So, are you willing to totally change your thinking? Most people are not. So, ask yourself honestly, "am I willing to take the risk of losing who I think I am in order to find out who I really am?" Only in so doing, will you be able to transform your thinking. Once done, you might look upon the world with love and bemusement, and neither attached to the outcome nor judgmental of what appears next.
