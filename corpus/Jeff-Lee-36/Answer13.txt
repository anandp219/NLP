 It is simple but not easy. The problem is that you listen to your ego, yet a small part of you knows the truth and that you are hearing lies from within your own head. You have the same problem that everyone has, and at least 90% of people, perhaps 99% of those under age 50, have no clue as to who they truly are.How do you fix something so fundamental? You need to practice awakening techniques, whether you are an atheist or theist, and discover your true self. It requires self-honesty, daily meditation, forgiveness of your enemies, providing service to others, all methods of suppressing the ego by ignoring it thus allowing the true self to emerge. As you spend less time focusing on egoic thoughts, the real you, the one that relates to the whole, becomes apparent.
