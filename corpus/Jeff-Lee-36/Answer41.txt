 Of the several hundred types of bacteria that live in your gut, 99% are good, 95% make you healthy and 50% you can't live without. Unfortunately, if you have one that you need to get rid of through use of an antibiotic, it will assuredly kill very many of those that you want. Antibiotic abuse in the elderly has killed people by letting c-diff bacteria take over. People with diverticulitis have often taken three kinds of antibiotics with a net result of wiping out 75% of the important gut bacteria. Others have abused sugar, sugar substitutes, and bread and other products containing yeadt, such that a naturally appearing fungus in our gut, candida, takes over, and its byproduct toxins kill off a great number of those essential gut bacteria. The problem is, a great many doctors are not even familiar with this area as most of the research is new and not yet widely disseminated outside the Harvard and Cleveland Clinic publications, and many of the doctors that are aware, are not aware of the significance, diagnosis steps, and treatment protocols, partly because it is not yet standard AMA practice, the insurance companies will not pay for it, the doctor knows it isn't going to kill you, and he/she doesn't have time. If you provided the health history and asked the right questions, you can get better health care, but it starts with self-education. One step is reading some of the articles on probiotics, however, do not assume this makes you a doctor. Your symptoms could look relevant to your untrained mind and a doctor would know when and where to ignore correlation versus cause. That said, there are doctors who specialize in Ayurveda and would help establish the best probiotic sources.
