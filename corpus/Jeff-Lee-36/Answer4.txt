 If it were possible to have "ego death," then it would be both a psychological disorder and enlightenment. Regardless how good one gets at removing fears and being honest with oneself, it is truly impossible to eliminate the ego, for even a spiritualized ego is still an ego. To truly eliminate the ego may not even be healthy. It would require losing all concepts of self, all value of the body and it's safety and existence. Can you imagine reaching a state wherein you no longer remember your name, or have a food preference, or a desire to execute a plan, where ALL is acceptable, including the baby in front of you being killed or raped?I would gladly settle for killing off 90% of the ego, but I am not even sure that is a sensible way to put it, as we don't really lose our ego so much as we gain focus on the nonegoic. It is our attention to the valuable that keeps us from focusing on the valueless.
