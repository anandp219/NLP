 They are probably well-intentiined, not realizing thst it is none of their business. We in the business community had to stop asking thst question in job interviews 35 years ago, so we are niw accustomed to never asking about relationships. In another 35 years, perhaps families will stop prying, too. You could tell them that your boyfriend wouldn't approve, and then laugh it off. But that sends some mixed signals if you are not gay. Tell them you are very picky, looking for someone as good as Mom, or some such. There are a lot of ways to deflect without offending. My preference is a play on a Buble song, "oh, there is a girl that madly loves me, she just hasn't met me, yet."
