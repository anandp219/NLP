 I think, almost by definition, that the Dunning-Kruger effect is seen in all people because there are two sides, the truly competent tend to underestimate their abilities and the incompetent vastly over-rate theirs. The later part is more predominantly exemplified by the far right wing posters who are generally spouting things they have heard, without reading complete story (e.g. Supreme Court opinions that identify the exact nature of why something can or cannot be considered a constitutional protection), and filter their view with a religious or family bias, thereby switching subjects and losing the thread of logic;excitedly post a retort that is an exact quote from Fox News Channel, as if the mantra of an entertainment talking head has any relevance to facts, or considers the context of an issue;offer no better justification for a viewpoint other than, because God;in their strongly held belief in gun ownership, conflate all discussion of gun control, registration or curbing types of weapons, as taking away guns or the rights of schizophrenics and wife batterers to own them;tend to read one-sided publications, blogs, facebook, tweets, and infotainment channels, and thereby assume they are in the majority and that those opposing these views are demons;have never done any mental analysis of their family conditioning and hence, emotional and irrational biases against persons of color, atheists, homosexuals, or "the other Party," making it impossible for them to have a balanced viewpoint that is not objectification against truth; andoften lack the education and experience to use reason over emotion, thereby deciding on the answer, then fitting their selective beefs into their argument, filtering out inconvenient facts, and not even realizing that they have done it.Now, that is not to say that there are not brilliant conservatives entering well-considered arguments for discussion, or that there are not a few liberals that take positions without a full self-analysis, but the question being answered is which group is more likely to represent the overestimating of their knowledge, skills and abilities. "One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision" Bertrand Russell
