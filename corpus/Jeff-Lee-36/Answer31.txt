 I am not sure what disconnect you see between being a socialist and being homophobic. It is perhaps atypical, and therefore makes you stand out if your liberal friends all share a common point of view and you don't happen to share that one. If this is your motivation for change, it is not a good one, and it will fail if your goal is to be internally judgmental but desiring to be externally accepting so that your friends do not accuse you of being intellectually bankrupt. Your thoughts are your own, and you are the only one who can will to change them. If you are sincere in your quest as a truth seeker, realizing that your friends are usually right, and that on this subject you might be wrong, then begin with the idea of discovering why you feel the way you do. Did your father, or a teacher or minister convince you that homosexuals were sinners, or pedaphiles, or into S&M or were out to convert others? If so, you are now an adult and know that none of those things are true, and should have no problem transforming earlier errors in thinking. Did a homosexual ever approach you and make you feel uncomfortable and you responded in anger? Can you see, now, that it was not truly threatening and the matter could have simply ended with, "Dude, I am flattered, but I don't swing that way," and end with a smile and a handshake? Did you ever have uncomfortable thoughts of attraction to another guy, and then repress them in shame because you were afraid of being rejected by family? Can you see, now, that it is common in youth, means nothing, and you need not fear, and that even if you were bisexual, your family would probably not reject you?Did you have a role model who was extremely homophobic and you simply adopted all this persons values because he was a trusted mentor, and made you feel special, and that you were not mature enough at the time to question that belief, or question him, and that you are now free to form your own conclusions based on its merits and on your own values?You certainly are correct to want to question your beliefs and change them if your higher values encourage you to do so. Try and empathize with the gay person who thinks and acts exactly as you do, in every single way but one. What legitimate reason could you have for judging? Why would that one thing make that person not be deserving of equal protection under the law, or of having someone love them, or deserve your respect? I hope you are sincere, and that you join the mainstream of thought that values all humans in all their cultural diversity. Socialistic thought has great merit, partly because it does value inclusion. If you do not view life through the lens of racial and social equity, you are not seeing clearly. Either we all stand together, or we all fall separately.
