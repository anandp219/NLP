 The word fake does not apply to something that is exactly what it is supposed to be.I won't go through the false statements and erroneous conclusions about your understanding of what money is, but you should consider reading a Money and Banking textbook. Of course, if you assume you are correct, you may not get anything out of it, because what you used to think is money was a very wrong definition, and until you abandon that notion, you may not understand what money truly is. Yes, fractional reserve banking creates money in synch with the creation of debt, which was true in the bad old days of a gold standard, going back hundreds of years. It is a very appropriate response to the needs of natural business and population growth, and the supply and demand for credit/money automatically fine tunes this growth at a given interest rate. Essentially money is what we say it is, and it virtually is all electronic, but that suits its purpose perfectly. And, accounts are typically fully insured, therefore, the problems relating to bank runs are almost nonexistent. In fact, when bank failures are close to exceeding the FDIC abilities, banks are quietly sold to investors such as Warren Buffet until such time as a purchasing bank can be established.
