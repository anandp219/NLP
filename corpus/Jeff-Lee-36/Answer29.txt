 I am a big fan of find by doing. Live, with integrity, a little longer, and it will dawn on you that one of the things that you are good at, and one of things the world needs, and one of things that you enjoy the most, all overlap into one most obvious thing. Meanwhile, I am also a big fan of Les Mattheson's finding who you are through living your values. Perhaps you don't find your function, so much as it finds you. While you are doing this living, waking up to your true self, what can you do to become more comfortable with the search, more reassured of the right track, and intellectually affirmed? My choice is meditation. It is not that it is a path in itself, although it could be; it might speed up the living and remove some of the pain or the doubt. It does this by quieting the ego. Whenever you can make decisions without the ego, you are seeing the real you, that unconscious self that has the higher values and is unconcerned with having reasons to do things, (impressing people, being in control, being right, getting back at people, justifying hatreds, protecting from perceived threats, isolating from love, being special, protecting cherished false beliefs; attacking enemies), such as the typical motivations of egoic thinking. Meditation allows for a sort of Inner Guidance or knowledge to direct your thinking. It strengthens your integrity by increasing your vigilance of your thoughts, so that you can see yourself more honestly.
