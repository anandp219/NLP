 With apology to Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia may not be your best source, depending on whether you want what is most popular about a person, today, or what earlier historians and experts consider to be a person's most significant contributions, thoughts, and experiences. Admittedly, sometimes, Wikipedia will be superior, but my money is on the writers and editors of the several encyclopedias.If you don't want to go to the library reference section to enjoy the feel and smell of the 25 volume World Book Encyclopedia, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Funk & Wagnells Encylopedia, or Colliers Encyclopedia, electronic options arevavailable. The advantage of the ecyclopedia method is that it is professionally written and is edited by multiple qualified academic leaders of the appropriate discipline, rather than an electronic version of unsupervised curators. As such, it may include the unconventional but more accurate treatment of a leader, philosopher, physicist, writer, including their effect on history as perceived by their peers, rather than simply what they were most recently famous for, or only one persons idea of what is most relevant. Of course, in 200 words, you are only glossing over the life of a noteworthy or influential person, and perhaps you will get sufficient information from electronic sources, which have the distinct advantage of being free. Although an encyclopedia generally costs $1,000 for a set, a one years electronic subscription is available for $120 and would be an invaluable tool for someone wanting condensed and verified material.
