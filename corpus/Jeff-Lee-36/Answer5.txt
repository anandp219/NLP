 I am not sure I understand the second part of the question, it is perhaps a translation into English problem? Or is it that the number of assumptions made by the OP are so outside the norm that I am unable to see a linkage to something that the OP sees as causal connections? Regarding the first part, I don't believe one can make the assumption that introversion and extroversion are heritable traits. They are an epiphenomenon, a byproduct of ego. Identical twins raised in opposite environments would have opposite fears, beliefs, reactions, preferences, etc. Furthermore, even if one believed that introspection or risk taking were such traits that indirectly affect survival, there is not necessarily a connection of those traits to introversion or extroversion, nor are introspection and risk taking necessarily heritable.
