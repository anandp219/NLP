 God is a word meaning different things to everyone, but ultimately it means the Source of the universe. And to me, God means:All That Is. The One, the Unity of all MindsThe Thought behind all thoughtThe Spirit behind all spiritThe Home to which we returnThe Unconditional Love source of every soul in existenceThe eternal process of interconnectedness of spiritThe force behind the manifestation of mind to matterThe ongoing extension of all loving thought The Consciousness behind all conscious thoughtThe Awareness behind every loving "I Am" thoughtThe inseparable relationship of loving spiritual energy that is USThe link to all minds via the Voice for God, or Holy SpiritTherefore, God is not an entity, nor separate, nor outside of us, nor judgmental or responsible for anything in the world except for that which we choose to accept responsibility when we focus upon our larger Self, therefore God is also, you, and me.
