 Neutral? I think not, it is a trolling question wrtten by, yes, a homophobe. You assertions that there are similarities between pedophiles and homosexuals is absurd, (what, because the thing they have in common is sex, and that you don't like them?). There is more similarity between heterosexuals and pedophiles as they generally have sex with someone of the opposite sex. The reason that your argument fails is because pedophiles are predatory, taking advantage of someone who, by definition, cannot give mature consent to have sex. It is a diagnosed mental disease and is criminal behavior. Neither is true of homosexuality.
