 Interesting that you have the awareness to realize that there is something amiss rather than let your ego tell you that because you were old before your time, that you are more mature than others. I knew a girl who joined a meet up group of adult children of alcoholic parents. In her case, it backfired because she didn't really heal, she became a bigger victim, using the label as an excuse for everything, self-permission not to grow. I am inclined to say, professional therapy. It may not take a lot of time or money; group therapy may even work well for you, in that what you are needing to do, is learn techniques of observation that allow confidence to grow organically. In this case it may be failing without guilt is the success you seek. You need not be perfect and you can hopfully learn to stop expecting so much from yourself. It probably will involve identifying what is typically uncomfortable, then work on being successful in steps, celebrating each competency, as you expand your toolbox. Several months of weekly sessions working with a therapist can probably give you all that you need to do the work, yourself, for another year or two. You gave up many years of what the rest of us take for granted, having fun, making mistakes, taking risks, being supported and loved in both those mistakes and those successes. It will not be immediate, but it will happen. There are self help books such as The Work of Byron Katie. Before buying, you could watch the author use the "turnaround" technique on any of 50 free You Tube videos. There are also Byron Katie groups in many of the top 50 metro areas. Another possibility is an Attitudinal Healing Center, or if your city does not have one, perhaps it has an Attitudinal Healing meet up group with certified practioners. Knowing the source of a problem is truly half the battle. Meditation is probably beneficial as well, because it affords more awareness of your thoughts, permitting reconditioning once the self honesty becomes second nature.
