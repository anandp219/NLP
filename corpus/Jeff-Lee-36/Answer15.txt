 The major religions all stem from one religion, so it is not surprising that they all have the same stance on certain subjects. The nature of the Bible is that it is a collection of writings of a few dozen people over a period of nearly two thousand years, starting around 4000 years ago, these writings were a mix of Babylonian mythology, history of the Jews, metaphorical fairy tales, and an occasional story of morality or supposed miracles. It is these last two that are the attraction of religious philosophers. Because they tend to believe these, they choose to believe the rest even though there is absolutely no justification for considering any of the rest of the books to have any spiritual value. Regardless of the fact that not one person in millions would give any credence to 90% of Leviticus, ( eating shellfish, or wearing cotton with wool, or having an affair, as all being cause for being stoned to death), they choose to find the proscriptions against homosexual behavior as reason for all sorts of oppression and hatred. There is only one possible explanation: people love to elevate themselves by finding groups to hate, whether because it is their ancestors' enemies, or the color of their skin is different, or because their religion has identified a behavior that they themselves don't do.
