 The person who buys or sells real estate without a realtor is like the lawyer representing himself, a fool as a representative and a bigger fool for a client. Besides the fact that sheer numbers and timing work against not being in the game, there are harsh economic realities. If you save 3% on a $1,000,000 sale, but it took you 6 months longer, the time value of money would have cost you the 3% that you saved. If the best price you were offered was $960,000, but the broker had access to 200 more likely buyers, one of which would pay full price, you costed yourself more than you saved.The expertise in closing a deal timely can make all the difference in whether a deal ever closes. Knowing when and when not to participate in financing, knowing when and when not to remove a contingency or add one, or in setting the asking price, or if a series of negotiations is exoevted, or desire able or is a ploy to control the property and you should refuse a counter-offer, knowing when the other broker is commiting an ethical violation, knowing which appraisers or environmental firms are good, which ones are slow, which ones are overpriced. The list goes on and on. I have only participated in five home purchases and four home sales in vastly different economic situations and geographies, and another ten multimillion dollar purchases of land, buildings, and development projects for my company. In the 19 situations, not one was remotely similar or had things from which I could have handled from what I learned in my earlier experiences. If I do another 19 deals in my life, I assure you, I will never do so without adequate representation from an experienced broker.
