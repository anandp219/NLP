 Your remorse to us on Quora is not what really counts. I can only hope that you have not permanently jeopardized your relationship with your son. You should make every attempt to apologize for a massive overreaction. The possibility of him being suicidal is still a realistic concern. He needs to know that there are no qualifications to your love for him, that he could commit murder and you are the one person on the planet in whom he can count on for support. If you believe in God, then, hopefully you can understand the concept of unconditional love. That is what you should be communicating to your son. I am glad he is now safe. I hope you truly want him home and that he will return, as you both have some healing to do, and being together is a chance for both of you to grow toward one another rather than apart. As for the big mistake, I hope you learned never to judge a loved one harshly, again, and espevially, that a loving parent never rejects their child regardless of the initial shock. You have plenty of good advice, including resources from which you can learn more about gay teens, gay adults, family support groups, and ways you can personally strengthen your relationship wit your son. Fully, five people in ten are gay, and it is how God made them. Do not let misinformed and bigoted religious fundamentalists twist the meaning of love nor change what you already know, that your son deserves happiness in whatever form it takes, and equal protection under the law. Let him know that you would lay down your life for his right to be happy.
