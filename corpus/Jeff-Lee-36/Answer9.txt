 I am not sure your question, as stated, is as meaningful to others as it is to you, in that it might not necessarily make the case that you believe you want to make, which, I assume, has something to do with proving the existence or non existence of God or the supernatural. All experiences with the earth, with math, with philosophy, with your body, with your self concept, are products of the brain. Regardless of the location of the seat of conciousness, you have only one mechanism for the awareness of your thoughts. Even if, in your paradigm, the world of the mind is a vast unity of thought of all that exists, and the brain a near worthless hunk of meat, then an over dramatized metaphor would be the world of the mind is your computer or tablet, and the brain is merely the screen, or the glass of your tablet. Everything has to come through that nearly worthless glass if you are to see the inner-workings.
