 And what if you get hit by lightning, and what if a meteorite hits the earth? These are not much different or worse than "what if I weren't short?" and "what if I wasn't born poor and black?" An alternative to "what if..bad" and "what if..wasn't " is the more optimistic, "what if I win the lottery?" and "what if I get that promotion?" The "what if..good?", exercise is at least not entirely wasted thought in that it could prepare you for something that you actually want, and some beneficial background subissues and subplots could be resolved in your unconcious mind allowing you to capitalize on opportunities that might lead to such outcomes. But, ultimately, "what if" scenarios are generally not healthy in that they are diversions, time wasters, and excuses not to be living in the present. Along with being nonproductive, the "what if..bad?" thoughts are a sign that that there is some belief in, "I am bad" or "I am not worthy" or "I always make the wrong choice" or "I am not as good as" or "I am never going to win the girl", none of which are ever true, however, we hold these as unconcious beliefs, unhealed traumas from our pre-memory childhood. One doesn't need multi-year Freudian analysis to get at the core experience in order to resolve these. Any good therapist can help you unwind the habits of misaligned thinking. It often does involve working with one's personal history to think back to the examples of where these might have first surfaced and where they initially exhibited a concretizing effect on the persona. When we surface these thoughts, let them out into the air and sunlight, they often vanish. Our conscious mind can reaffirm the truth that it was silly childish beliefs and conditioning, and finally expunge the belief from the unconscious mind. "What if I was healed of my irrational fears and negative thinking?" Now, there is a "what if" question worth asking.
