 I have never seen one. I think all the newspaper stories were black and white prior to World War Ii, although there may have been some magazine pictures, it was just as common to have sketches. It was done in pieces and the assebled here, sections provided early for fundraisers for the base. I imagine that it never had the shiny copper look, more like an old penny, even by the completion of the transatlantic voyage(s), a medium brown. So, given the assembly time, and possibly sitting outside much of the time prior to the completion of the base, it may have looked a blueish green streaked brown by opening day.
