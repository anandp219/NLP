 Does calling life unfair do anything for you? The question of life's fairness need not be asked unless you perceive some benefit in blaming something external for whatever it is you find underachieving or incomplete in your life. I would think it more valuable to simply do the best you can in all circumstances and stop comparing yourself to others. Life is life. It is what it is. It is neither good nor bad, and despite what people want to believe, it cannot be made to have attributes of equality of being. If every single person on the planet looked identical and was of exact same musculature, appearance, temperment, aptitude, intelligence, family size, and income per family, someone would complain that those who lived on the Southern side of the street were warmer because they saw the Sun more. For what it is worth, being born to a billionaire is no guarantee of good health, mental stability, or happiness in relationships, and being born poor, or disabled, does not preclude someone from getting a Nobel prize or spending every day in joy. Equality is overrated. Fairness is an idea, invented by victims, to justify their belief in their victimhood. Justice is the belief that lack of fairness is fixed with punishment to beneficiaries or rewards to victims.
