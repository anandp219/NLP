 Ultimately, they would both be psychological in that the deal with the mind, would they not? Certainly, our understanding of the ego, starts with Freud's work in defining the formation of an abstract idea of the self, based in reaction to our earliest experiences, fears, sublimation, projection, dissociation, and transference, and this "abstract entity," we refer to as the "psychological ego." It was great pioneering work and survives to this day as the absolute best way to describe the abstract inner working of the mind, and the normal and abnormal development of each individual's psyche or persona. If you accept that the existence of conciousness is not solely an emergent property of the brain, we refer to that as spiritual mind. This spiritual self, if it exists, and if it is not emergent from the brain, it would carry properties we normally associate with the mind, as it is totally abstract, not needing the physical for its existence, but only for its expression, and would pre-exist the brain, in time. There is a subschool of Advaita Vedanta that would say that there is a Mind or Spirit created long prior to birth, (even billions of years ago). Regardless of whatever metaphysical underpinnings fit your paradigm of reality, we could say that this Spirit, for the exact same reasons that Freud identified as occurring in the developing human, would also have a Spiritual ego, and that it went through processes of unnatural beliefs and fears, traumas, dissociation, and reactions to its maker, forming unexamined conclusions, selective awareness, a not clear knowing of true self, etc.
