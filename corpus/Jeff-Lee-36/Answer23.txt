 Assuming you are correct in your diagnosis, you would be wasting your time in that persons with NPD are the last persons on the planet likely to admit a problem. You could aggravate her into a retaliation that includes lies and presents a danger to you.Your best investment in your future is to not be angered by her but realize that she has a major mental illness, disregarding that she appears to be cold and calculating, realizing that she is doing the best she can under the circumstances. Becoming a forgiving person, not only allows you to better enjoy life by preventing periods of obsessive anger and defensiveness, it promotes an improved outcome in your interactions by preventing defensive counter- attacks by your mother. I know you probably feel victimized, and that is to be expected but, lining up supporters against her is not going to help. You have the unfortunate burden of being born into this family and you will have to stay there until you are 18. You need to make the best of the situation by learning to cope with her problems, by becoming the adult in the relationship. Try to show compassion despite being mistreated, I know it is not easy. Good luck.
