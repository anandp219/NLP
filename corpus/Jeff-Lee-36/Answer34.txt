 Absolutely. Only a mentally dysfunctional person is capable of committing unloving or harmful acts to their offspring. But, I would carry it a step further. Wanting to hurt anyone is a sign of a mental problem. It doesn't matter if they are of the opposite political party, a different religion, a gang wearing different colors, or whether they have, in fact, actually harmed you, your reputation, your bank balance, and whether that harm was accidental or deliberate. It is all a matter of degree on a continuum. Relative morality, religious righteousness (still wrong-ness ) simply gives yourself permission for hate, judgment, desiring punishment or retribution, even executing that action in the legal system. It is all a neurotic attempt to project our own fears and sekf-worth issues onto others. It is all "normal" human behavior. The extreme may be more obvious in its wrongness or mental illness, but it all is less than admirable for a species that believes it is the highest state of development or one imbued with the holiness of its creator.
