 Like Les, I don't find much value in that particular formula, although I suppose it could benefit some people. Most short cuts to actual thinking through and understanding the theory behind something, lose its value once the second person tells the third person, (without the 40 page explanations as to why, how, exceptions, nuances, etc.), and the rule becomes misunderstood dogma, and then the fourth person and the fifth person poke holes in it, because they don't have an honest clue as to what the original meaning was. Religions are very much like that. At the risk of spreading more shortcut messages that could potentially be abused, I do find a few abbreviated thought processes that are helpful to me. One is Assess, Align, and Act, which like ready, aim, fire, is important to do in the right order to be of any value. Its value to me is that it helps remind me that I need only see things clearly, then check to see if it aligns with my values, then act only after having determined that it is what was the right thing to do all along once I untangle or de-complicate the issues surrounding a problem or a set of equal appearing choices. Another is:  Pause, Step Back, Step Aside and Let Inspiration Guide.Another is Rest, Accept, and Trust, but it is a higher order methodology that truly requires mastering a couple of earlier steps in the ladder in order to be of benefit, and many pages to describe the value in acceptance, viewing from the lens of truth and equity, and acting from integrity.
