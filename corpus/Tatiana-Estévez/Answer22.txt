 Your boyfriend sounds very supportive and he is correct, doing well on Quora means sometimes getting weird A2As and seeing some weird stuff. That doesn't make it OK though and we take this issue very seriously. We at Quora do totally appreciate how uncomfortable it can make users and we don't want users not contributing or leaving Quora because someone is creeping them out. 'Hitting on you', 'complimenting your lips', asking if you had 'lip surgery' are things that I take a very dim view of. Frankly if I find out who this person is they'll be banned. All content and users can be reported on Quora, using the in-product reporting function. However I appreciate that sometimes reporting in situations like this doesn't feel like enough, particularly when the comment in isolation of any context doesn't appear to violate BNBR (it does!), or sometimes you may just want to give some explanation, that when you can contact me. Feel free to email me at moderation@quora.com for any issues of other users 'hitting on' users, or anything related.EDIT: I found out who it was, yes they were banned.
