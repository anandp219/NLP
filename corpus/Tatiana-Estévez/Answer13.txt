 We don't really judge the 'intent' behind question, so what I think is happening is that a question has been deleted or the tagged as rhetorical or insincere. This isn't so much about your intent, because we appreciate that it may well have been that you sincerely wanted to write that, we're referring to whether or not the phrasing of the questions is a sincere attempt to get answers. Here is an illustrative example: Why do people want to make my life difficult by asking problematic questions? This is rhetorical, because it is presenting the opinion that people want to make life difficult when they ask problematic questions. This comes across as insincere, because in reality I must know that most people have no idea who I am and how I might be affected by their questions.The only real answer is 'they don't want to make my life difficult'. However that's not really helpful because we still don't know why people ask these questions, which is the real question. We do appreciate though that asking these questions in this manner is very natural, and many people do it. Generally we try not to sanction users for this and instead we encourage them to fix their question, we may tag it with one of the Needs Improvement topics or Quora Moderation may give a specific reason. When it comes to questions about groups of people though, we tend to be more aggressive. Myself in particular will aggressively delete questions that seem to be making a point about a group of people rather asking an open question, particularly if asked anonymously. If you think that one of your questions has been unfairly deleted by moderation you may email appeals@quora.com.
