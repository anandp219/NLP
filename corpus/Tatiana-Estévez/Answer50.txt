 I assume that you have this page number as codes in the header or footer pages and when you click in the header or footer it says:Page 1 of 1 and when you highlight those numbers they are surrounded by a grey box indicating that they are fields. What you now now need to do is replace the second field with a field that does what you want. So delete this and then go to 'Insert' on the menu and select 'Fields'. In Categories select 'Numbering' and in Field names select 'SectionPages'. NB, I'm on an old version of Word on the Mac. The principles are the same on the newer versions on the PC, but here is how you add field codes on Microsoft 2010 for PC: Page on office.com
