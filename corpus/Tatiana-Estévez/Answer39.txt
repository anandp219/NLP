 Women don't reply to men's messages when they are unsolicited and unwelcome. They are here to share their knowledge with people and engage in intellectual discussion. When guys are genuine about just 'wanting to talk and nothing else' they don't just message women out of the blue. There is a period where they interact in discussions in comments. They know if a woman is not responding to their comments then she may be busy or she may not be interested in having a discussion with him, they don't then message her, because they know that it isn't appropriate. Quora takes this seriously and last year strengthened it's Be Nice, Be Respectful policy to include:We state explicitly that our Be Nice, Be Respectful policy applies to Messages on Quora.We have strengthened the Harassment clause, adding language that prohibits sexually explicit, profane, adversarial, or flirtatious language toward another person if such language would likely make the person uncomfortable.You can read more on Marc Bodnick's post here: A stronger Be Nice, Be Respectful policy: Messages are now fair game (and the Harassment clause is more explicit) by Marc Bodnick on The Quora Moderation BlogAny woman who gets a message like this should report these messages, which automatically blocks the user and is sent to us for action. Users sending messages like this will be edit blocked or banned. Please don't be reserved about doing this, you're not just doing it for yourself, but for every other woman getting messages she doesn't want to receive. Feel free to message me as well with these, either via our inbox messages or email me at moderation@quora.com.
