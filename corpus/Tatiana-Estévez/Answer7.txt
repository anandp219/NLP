 There are many reasons why this question could have been blocked for a while, to avoid this in future, you should phrase this question non-rhetorically and without a link that may be taken as driving traffic to another site. However none of that will be of any use to use, because the purpose of this question was to give users an affiliate link. These are strictly prohibited and I have now deleted the question completely. Please see this link for the full policy: Are affiliate codes in links allowed on Quora?
