 If you're worried and you cannot get a definitive answer to address that worry, then why would you take the risk for $400? Even if the risk is small, if it does affect your career, the consequences will cost far more than $400. As to whether or not it will affect your future career, it is going to depend a lot on what future career is. Graphic Designer? I don't think anyone will care. Teacher? Yeah, there is a good chance that people might care, but as said in another answer, if it is tasteful you might be fine. I think this also will depend on how you view this as well, are you proud to show off your body and have art created from it - many people would be, or do you see this as something embarrassing and slightly shameful to pose nude for money? Social media has made this world a lot smaller and harder to hide from than it used to be. If you're going to do something you're not proud of, make sure there is no one around getting evidence.
