 Quora hasn't yet organised any official meet-ups in London, but we've had some unofficial ones and a couple of semi-official ones. The most recent one was in August last year. I also have a blog and anyone who wants to organise a meetup or know about them can join and submit posts: Quora London meetups. It should be noted that there isn't a huge community of very active Quora users in London, so it can be hard to get traction for events organised, but no doubt I will attempt to do one again so be alert!
