 Deodorants and perfumes are designed to be applied directly to the skin. Deodorants need to be applied directly on to the skin in order to work effectively. Perfumes don't have to be applied directly to the skin, but if they are the perfume is frequently enhanced and has a more personal effect. Some people are allergic to perfumes and therefore should avoid them completely as they may find even the smell will irritate them. Some people with sensitive skin may find that their skin does get irritated if they use too much perfume, therefore applying perfume to their clothes instead of their skin may be desirable. If they do do this, they should avoid spraying perfume on delicate or light coloured fabrics as it can stain. Alternatively for the sensitive skinned people, they can spray a little perfume into their hairbrush and brush their hair with it and that can be a good way to use perfume without irritating their skin.
