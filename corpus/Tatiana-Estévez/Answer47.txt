 This is a message you get if you're anonymous on the question page. Nothing changes from the point of view of the report and the person whose content you have reported won't know that you reported it. However this is to let you know that although you're anonymous on the question, you won't be anonymous to moderation and they know it is you that made the report. All other anonymous activity on that page remains anonymous. In fact we as moderation won't know that you are anonymous on that page. This message is only to make you aware of this fact in case you thought your report would be anonymous to moderation.
