 Generally there are going to be more potential advantages to continuing the process with little actual risk. The ones I can see are: RisksYou waste a little bit of your time that you had already decided to spend doing this anyway. This time is unlikely to be recouped at such short notice in any useful way.BenefitsUnknown but potentially:  You actually find out that you were wrong about not wanting the job and you do want it.That both you and the interviewer realise youre wrong for this job, but they realise youre right for another, much better job, this is not an unusual scenario.You get some practice with your interview technique. This can be really useful when you dont actually care about getting the job. All the benefits may seem unlikely, but two of these are potentially very rewarding, for the cost of a little time which you have effectively lost anyway. If you do decide to cut it short, you do risk annoying the interviewer, which may be a problem for you if you ever want to work in the company again, or any company that the interviewer may be working in in future. It is amazing how small the world can be and how many faces you wouldnt have expected ever to see again cropping up. Dont burn your bridges.
