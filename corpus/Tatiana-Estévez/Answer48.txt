 1,300 is a decent amount of money for a 1 bedroom flat in London and you should be able to find something that works well for you in a variety of places. Considering this budget and criteria, to me the obvious recommendation is Balham. It is a very popular area amongst young professionals. It has lots of great pubs, bars and restaurants. I know a lot of people who would love to live in Balham, but don't quite have your budget.Transport-wise it is quite good, it is on the Northern Line, that means you can get to either the West End (good for shopping) or The City in about 20 minutes.
