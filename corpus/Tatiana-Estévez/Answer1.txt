 I used to be a beauty therapist, with a specialty in aromatherapy. Aromatherapy is about getting the benefits of essential oils into your system. The usual ways of doing this is via inhalation or massage. Generally you cannot charge much for asking people to sniff some oils so when booking 'aromatherapy' in most spas you can expect a massage with essential oils. First I would sit down with a client and have a short chat about what they were looking for, the usual thing is people want to relax and destress. Sometimes they might specify that they need more energy. I'd blend a few oils that I thought would work well for them, which would become the fragrance for the massage oil. The massage I did was normally just using basic Swedish massage techniques which I would customise depending on the type of treatment they had requested. So if they had requested a relaxing treatment I would increase the amount of Effleurage and Petrissage, For a more energising massage I'd increase the Tapotement and Friction in the massage. I would also spend sometime wafting the essential oils in front of their nose - this is the inhalation part that I spoke of earlier. I will make a confession, I think nearly every massage I have ever done, left the person being massaged asleep after about 20-30 minutes. It didn't matter how energising I tried to make it.
