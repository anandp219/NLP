 People like free food and when you're on an internship and not earning any money, getting a free lunch seems like a good idea. You could be right and she was hinting that she wanted you to pay, but she might have been hoping you would say 'hey did you know I'm independently wealthy and actually get more money every time I buy someone a lunch, luckily my girlfriend doesn't mind because I'm 100% faithful to her?". If you want to pay for her fine, but don't do it with the expectation that it is significant or it will lead to something. I have no idea if she likes you or just sees you as a colleague, but I do know that the type of people who date people because they got a free lunch are probably not going to be a good long term prospect. The great thing about this scenario is that you're probably going to get to know her a lot better over the next few days/weeks. If you want to treat her, don't be extravagant, keep it classy, buy her a coffee, but don't put her in position where either of you feel like she is indebted to you. On an end note, one of the most successful men I know with women is this guy who refuses to treat any woman. He doesn't care if he asked her out or she asked him out, he insists that the bill be split on every date, he does it purely as he thinks these things should be equal. He is upfront about this and has never had any trouble getting a date.
