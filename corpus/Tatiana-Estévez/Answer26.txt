 White mascara is a fairly specialised product, however you should be able to find it in places that sell make-up for professional make-up artists who do magazine, stage and/or TV work. Screenface based in London, is the best professional make-up suppliers that I'm aware of and you can buy their products online.They do have a white mascara, by Ben Nye, it is definitely not a primer and is mainly intended to whiten small areas of hair on the face to show someone greying. They do state on the product that it can be used for lashes, Please note it is always important to verify that products are OK to be used near the eyes. This product costs 10.10. I have personally not used this particular product, but as it is sold by Screenface, there is some assurance of it being a good product that does what it is stated to do.
