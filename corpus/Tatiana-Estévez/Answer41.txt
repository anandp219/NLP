 The creative director role of a fashion house is a design role and that is the route you will need to go. Working in shops and writing blogs may help you in other areas of fashion but if you want to be a designer, you have to focus on the design side of fashion. To go this route is more difficult than just becoming an established fashion designer. You will need to set yourself up to be better than the rest. The competition you will experience down the road for this is huge. You will need a combination of talent, hard work and tenacity to achieve this. To really set yourself out on the right path, the first step is that you need a degree. I'm not saying it is impossible to do without a degree, but you're 16 and there is no reason to skip this step at this stage of your life. Although at 16 you're not quite ready, so make sure you do well in your A-Levels. As you live in London the clear choice is the University of Arts London (UAL). UAL has two colleges that have undergraduate fashion design courses, Central Saint Martins (famous alumni: Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney) and the London College of Fashion (famous alumni:Jimmy Choo). The BA Hons in CSM is full time and the LCF is part time, so if you can't afford not to work, don't let that stop you. They also have a variety of other courses related to fashion design. Many people use this time to make a name for themselves. They get noticed by having provocative fashion shows and some fashion companies will try and talent spot at these events. After university there are a variety of avenues you can choose. You may decide to get an in-house role or you may set yourself up as a designer yourself. Entering competitions and getting awards for your design will help you make a name for yourself and this will add to your value. Yes being commercial is important, but being well known in the fashion circles has a commercial value as well.
