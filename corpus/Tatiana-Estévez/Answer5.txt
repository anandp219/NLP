 Well they are considered of Celtic descent as there was a group of people that inhabited Galicia who were Celtic and called Gallaeci. They have had other influences since then, but we have kept that association with the Celts.To me the land and nature of Galicia is very different from that of Andalucia or Valencia which have the culture that is more likely to be associated with Spain by tourists. With regards to looks I would say many Galicians have fairer skin than the average Spanish deep olive, we even have natural redheaded Galicians, and credit is given to the Celtic heritage. We still retain this link to the Celts in many things, for example the football team of the city my family is from in Galicia is called Celta de Vigo.
