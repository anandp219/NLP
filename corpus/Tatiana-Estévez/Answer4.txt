 I used to work in Sales and Marketing for a French cosmetics company called Bourjois.New product launches could be categorised as follows: New product range: This would be an entire new range of a product for example lipsticks. The lipsticks would have a new formula with at least one specific feature, e.g. moisturising or long-lasting, the packaging would be new and the range of colours would be new. New formula: Much less frequently the formula of a popular product would be upgraded. This is not that common and is only done when the brand of that product still has value, normally it is preferable to just create a new product. New introduction: Kind of like the new product range, but one that already exists in other markets. We sold a much larger range of products in France than we did in the UK. New colours: Colours are discontinued and added to all the time. There are several factors involved in the rationale of these. These new products would generally coincide with our promotion cycle which was every two months. We would launch extra colours off-cycle, but generally they would eventually get on the promotion cycle. Having said that not every promotion cycle had new products. Generally a new product line would be added a couple of times of year, but this wasnt a fixed number. New colours were introduced more often. No fixed amount and I never counted but most promotion cycles had a few new colours. These promotion cycles were based on the promotion cycles of Boots a significant customer for all the budget to mid-priced cosmetics companies and we all followed this cycle, with a similar pattern of promotion.
