 Matching handbags/purses precisely with shoes used to be a sign of someone who took a lot of care with their appearance, but now it isn't considered necessary and can even look a bit dated. However, if you wish to be considered stylish then you should definitely be coordinating your bag and shoes and making sure they don't clash. Coordinating doesn't always mean the same colour, but that the colours work together. You should also take into consideration the material of the bag, for example, you possibly wouldn't carry an all patent bag if you're wearing all suede shoes even if they're the same colour. Many women don't like to change their bag on a daily basis, so try and play it safe with a neutral bag. I think this can work, but black isn't a great choice for this unless you only wear black shoes. A better choice for a neutral colour is brown or beige. As with any fashion rule, you should feel free to break it, but only when you know it well enough. Just breaking it because you through on whatever that morning, is not going to make you look stylish.
