 Gabriel SeahSingaporeans love to go to Hong Kong and Bangkok.They like to eat and shop in those places, which are nearby (a few hours' flight at most). In Bangkok they also get massages.This is borne out by TripAdvisor's list of "Most searched destinations by Singaporeans":1. Hong Kong, China2. Bangkok, Thailand3. Taipei, Taiwan4. Seoul, South Korea5. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia6. Bali, Indonesia7. Batam, Indonesia8. Johor Bahru, Malaysia9. London, United Kingdom10. Melaka, Malaysia(TripAdvisor reveals travel trends for the upcoming holidays: Travel Weekly Asia)Wego also revealed that Bangkok andd Hong Kong were Singaporeans' top travel destinations (The Wrap: Wego unveils travel trends from Singapore, China, Hong Kong in the Year of the Horse - WIT).Singaporeans also go to Johor Bahru which is just across the border and to a lesser extent Batam and Bintan (a short ferry ride away in Indonesia). However this is just nipping across the border and doesn't count as bona fide travel, in my opinion.
