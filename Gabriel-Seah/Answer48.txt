 Gabriel SeahWomen are indeed less interested in philosophy than men.There is a well-documented gender gap in Philosophy faculty and graduate programs, and this is also evident in undergraduate enrollment (Page on socphilpsych.org), with fewer and fewer women as depth of involvement increases - from introductory Philosophy courses to representation of the faculty. The largest drop is between introductory Philosophy courses and Philosophy majors. Notably, out of all the humanities, women are most under-represented in Philosophy.When interviewed (Georgia State tries new approach to attract more female students to philosophy @insidehighered), female Philosophy students reported that,Women generally found the course less enjoyable, and the material less interesting and relevant to their lives, than their male counterpartsThey also had more personal reasons like being unable to identify with coursemates and instructors, but this is irrelevant where this question is concerned.It could be that women don't like philosophy because philosophy is largely based on principles, whereas women are more relational in their reasoning.Carol Gilligan criticises Kohlberg's stages of moral development (Page on barnard.edu) which puts principled moral reasoning as the apex of moral development, since women are more relational in morality. Indeed, feminist philosophy emphasises the ethics of care over traditional conceptions of morality (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy).Ethics (the study of morality) is a major part of philosophy so given that women are more relational in their morality than men, it would stand to reason that they would be less able to relate to philosophy and so be less interested in it.Beyond that, Simon Baron-Cohen (The Essential Difference front page) has found that,the female brain is predominantly hard-wired for empathy, and that the male brain is predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systemsPhilosophy like physics (another field where women are underrepresented) is a systemic discipline which works on universal principles, which could explain why women are less interested in it.
