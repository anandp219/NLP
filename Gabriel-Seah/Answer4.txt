 Gabriel SeahAdapted from: Gabriel Seah's answer to Why are people so upset about the killing of Cecil the lion?There is no reason to be against hunting for sport as it is currently practised.Let us look at some typical objections to hunting.Conservation angles?Panthera leo, the African Lion, is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Panthera leo (African Lion, Lion)).That might sound worrying, but Gadus morhua (Atlantic Cod) is also Vulnerable (Gadus morhua (Atlantic Cod, Cod, Codling, Haberdine, Kil'din Cod)) and most people have no problems with eating it. Ditto with lots of other species of seafood (10 Fish You're Eating That Are Endangered Species).The Giant Gippsland Earthworm - Endangered on the IUCN Red List (i.e. more endangered than the African lion) and the poster of child of no conservation campaignsFurthermore, hunting for sport can in many cases actually be *good* for threatened species.Hunters spend a lot of money, which stimulates local economies, and encourages locals to conserve wildlife so hunters can come and shoot animals.Indeed, the legalisation of white rhino hunting in South Africa was responsible for the population exploding from less than 100 to more than 11,000 (Can trophy hunting actually help conservation? - Conservation). Elephants in Zimbabwe have also benefited from hunting.Animal cruelty?The vast majority of those against hunting for sport happily eat meat, and factory farming is far more cruel (Farm Animal Cruelty) - it's just that you don't see or imagine it, so it's out of sight, out of mind.If it's alright for countless animals to suffer their entire lives just to give you some momentary pleasure from their meat, what is the suffering of a few animals to give a hunter his own pleasure?Hens in a cage. Battery hens live in these for an average of 18 months, almost 329 times as long as the 40 hours Cecil the lion took to dieUnsportsmanship-like behaviorThis is a somewhat more interesting objection.This objection to hunting goes along the lines of it being "unfair" for people armed with modern weaponry and other technology (and usually with support staff) to go up against animals only equipped with teeth and claws.And thus it is not a sport.One might question what fair play might involve.Should the hunter arm himself with a rifle without scopes and/or night vision devices?Should the hunter not camouflage himself?Should the hunter arm himself with a spear - no firearms?Should the hunter only use his bare hands?Yet, hunted animals are physically stronger, probably faster and definitely better equipped with natural weapons than humans.Just what should hunters do to give animals a sporting chance?Similarly, is it sporting for athletes from developed countries,- benefiting from nutrition and sport science- who can afford to train full-time- train at high altitudes to increase their red blood cell count- using the latest aerodynamic bodysuits (Under Armours secret Olympic mission: Build a faster speedskating suit) and- who have expensive personal trainers and coachesto go up against athletes from developing countries who- have day jobs- train barefoot on dirt tracks- are malnourished and- compete in simple jerseys?Really, all this fuss about hunters being unsporting is moot since we don't get upset when people are unsporting in other areas.Did Lance Armstrong get death threats for being unsporting and doping?Indeed, it seems to me that the only ones getting death threats in those instances were the ones who contributed to Armstrong's fall from grace (Is Lance Armstrongs Fate Really Worth Making Death Threats?). So people were upset at those seeking to maintain the purity of the sport (such as it is) more than Armstrong, who broke the rules.In other words, what upsets people isn't really that hunters are unsporting.And even if it were unsporting how would that make it "irresponsible"?Is anybody being hurt by killing for sport?
