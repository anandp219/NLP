 Gabriel SeahYes.A Norwegian study found that couples who share the housework are more likely to divorce than those with an unequal division of the chores (Couples who share the housework are more likely to divorce, study finds - Telegraph).The researchers suggest that this is partly because where there clear gender roles, there is less dispute between a couple. Feminists, then, with their insistence on eliminating gender roles, would have more contention in their relationships about gender roles and whether the split of responsibilities is gendered.Furthermore, the more modern a couple, the less sacred they view marriage. Feminism, which has a skeptical attitude to marriage and sometimes views it as an institution which oppresses women, would mean that feminist women are less favorable to marriage than non-feminist women.Other factors which lead to divorce are "marrying at a very early age, less education and income, living together before marriage, a premarital pregnancy, no religious affiliation, coming from a divorced family, and feelings of insecurity" (Page on usu.edu). Feminist women are likely to qualify on many of these criteria (and not to qualify in others), but in these cases it is not their being feminist per se that leads to the divorce, but factors correlated with their being feminist.
