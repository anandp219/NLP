 Gabriel SeahThere're 2 ways to look at this question: story logic and symbolism.Story LogicWithin the logic of the movie The Wolverine, the amputation of Wolverine's claws seems to be necessary for The Silver Samurai aka Yashida to extract Logan's healing factor.After Wolverine's claws are amputated, tiny drills extend from The Silver Samurai's suit and pierce his stumps, and the healing factor is extracted from him.Notably the tiny drills did not penetrate his skin - which would be easier to breach, being softer and more accessible than his stumps; just imagine how easy it would have been if Yashida had just needed to poke Wolverine anywhere (perhaps in the butt) and suck his healing factor.Perhaps the healing factor resided in his bones and accessing them through his claw stumps was the easiest way to penetrate his bones, since Yashida wouldn't have needed to work his way through flesh before hitting the bone. As we know, Wolverine's skeleton is coated with adamantium: the adamantium coating around his bone claws might also be thinner than that around the rest of his skeleton.Of course, Wolverine's declawing also made it easier for Yashida to extract the healing factor from Logan - since he had lost his main weapon.SymbolismWolverine's losing his claws is very interesting and potent imagery as he is strongly identified with his adamantium claws. It is interesting that he regenerates his bone claws - which he hasn't seen/used for almost 4 decades - and uses them to finish Yashida off.The loss of the adamantium claws (which have been on him from 1979 to 2013 [according to Timeline]), his near death at Yashida's hands and his Triumph the return of his bone ones can be seen as representing:Castration - he has lost the symbol of his Potency and his main Weapon/ToolThe Symbol of the Woman - Loner that he is, Wolverine has had many tragic relationships with women. First Kayla Silverfox, then Jean Grey and now Mariko. Yet he paradoxically finds strength in these women - and here it is the Woman who comes to save him from an enemy he cannot best.Rebirth - shorn of his adamantium claws, he is reborn as the old LoganExorcism - with the loss of his claws, he says goodbye to a part of his past and his old demons - he can now move on. Recall that after this he has a vision where he finally lets go of Jean Grey (when previously in the movie he has been haunted by her memory). I wouldn't go so far as to call this Redemption, though.Logan has lost something - but at the same time he has also (re)gained something - a part of himself that he has lost.
