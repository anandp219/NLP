 Gabriel SeahPornography is one way people let off sexual tension (no, not just in that way - get your mind out of the gutter!)Looking at American porn, we can observe that some subgenres like housewives getting it on with plumbers, electricians or pizza delivery men could represent an eroticisation of male insecurities. Just what is the missus getting up to when she's alone at home?This is similar to cuckolding scenarios (where someone other than a woman's partner or husband seduces her and has sex with her).Black men are seen as sex objects in Japan. There was even a phenomenon in the early 1990s about "yellow cabs" which capitalizedon the Japanese popular obsession with the specter of Japanese women copulating with foreign men, black men in particular. The male-dominated Japanese media took [Shoko] Ieda's bait, and in articles in low-brow men's weekly magazines quickly elevated the yellow cab phenomenon to scandal of the year, salaciously excoriating the women as sexually insatiable sluts in thrall to the black phallus - a threat, to say the least, to Japapn's racial and national purity- Women on the Verge: Japanese Women, Western Dreams / Karen KelskySome of this sexualisation of black men has been imported from American culture (The Blasian Narrative: The Status of Black People in Japan: Part VII - The Effect of anti-Black Stereotypes and Western Privileging on the Japanese construction of Blackness), but Japan has also nurtured it:The stereotypical imaages of black men in [Amy] Yamada's narratives resemble her depictions of women; as lusty, volatile, physical beings held captive by overpowering appetites and marginalized by dominant (Japanese and white male) economic power... A struggle then ensures, between the similar and disparate natures of black male / Japanese female - a struggle fought along the same axis of dominance/submission- Power and Gender in the Narratives of Yamada Eimi / Nina CornyetzThere is probably also some element of transgression of Japanese racial purity too, with black men being obviously non-Japanese and thus effectively Othered - if even zainichi* are not seen as Japanese by many Japanese, what more blacks?* - ethnic Koreans living in Japan, many of whom face discrimination as non-Japanese even if they were born thereAn alternative explanation is that these scenarios represent a projection of latent desires: Japanese men fantasise about getting it on like black men are seen as doing, and want to become as sexual(ised).
