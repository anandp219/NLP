Bowker.(Self-Help Books: Why Women Can't Stop Reading Them...)Companies which write these books know their market.Men are more instrumental in reading self-help/motivational books and will read those which are more useful, like books on business, investing, home-improvement and the like. Or books which seem to be more useful, at any rate.It is true that there are some which are more geared towards men, like:Chicken Soup for the Soul Cartoons for DadsChicken Soup for the Entrepreneur's SoulChicken Soup for the Father's SoulChicken Soup for the Father and Son's SoulChicken Soup for the Fisherman's SoulChicken Soup for the Gardener's SoulChicken Soup for the Golfer's Soul (there are two!)Chicken Soup for the NASCAR SoulChicken Soup for the Sports Fan's SoulChicken Soup for the Veteran's Soul(List of Chicken Soup for the Soul books)This is evidence of another phenomenon - men don't have a very strong identity.To put it another way, maleness is the default - so there's nothing special about it. As a parallel, consider how there are two types of clothing: female and unisex.
