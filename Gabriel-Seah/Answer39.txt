 Gabriel SeahOther answers have touched on some of the reasons:- The cost of an army- There being no army to begin with- The army doing other things (e.g. guarding the frontier, protecting the realm from invasion, being tied up in wars etc)- Adventurers being trained specialists who move faster and more stealthily- Efficiency: you don't get half your army killed since they are cannon fodder (or arrow/trap fodder, as the case might be)- This being story/game logicHowever, I would suggest a more profound reason: incentivized competition.In the real world, take the example of the Ansari XPRIZE for Suborbital Spaceflight, the first competition organised by the X Prize Foundation.This awarded US$10 million to teams which successfully built private spaceships which could carry three people and fly twice in two weeks.Sure, the X Prize Foundation gave out US$10 million. However, 26 teams invested more than US$100 million in R&D (Ansari Team Results). That's a 1000% return on investment, and you save on co-ordination costs.Kings and Village Leaders basically, then, outsource the cost to all the suckers out there. I mean the adventurers. Most of whom will die if they're not successful and thus will never come back to trouble you, either by demanding compensation or starting bar fights.The risk to the Kings and Village Leaders is minimal, as it is capped at the cost of the reward (which can only go to one party, fraud notwithstanding [this is why you must bring back the Dragon's Head, or something tangible and non-rival - i.e. which other teams cannot possess simultaneously]).The Leader of a successful party of adventurers in the Real World
