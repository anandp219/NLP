 Siddharth BhattacharyaOn the face of it, Holden Caufield embodies the struggles of the youth in coping up with the society, with the norms it puts up and striving for acceptance. He questions everyday norms, ridicules people blindly subscribing to these norms and sets himself apart from them. However what makes Holden Caufield a compelling character is one needs to go deeper to analyze him as a symbol. Holden Caufield is not just a rebel- he is a failed & confused rebel. Holden realizes what he doesn't want to be, but is clueless on what he wants to be. Holden is a negation of the existing societal phenomenon. He represents what's wrong with the society. But as an alternative, he is hollow. He is full of contradictions. He leaves his home, but doesn't know for what. He praises his Professor endlessly, goes to his home and flees away. He can see negative shades in every character apart from his younger sister 'old Phoebe'. Holden's protest against the status quo seems more just for the sake of it than leading anywhere. Holden symbolizes confused youth- rebels without a cause. He is an embodiment of the existential crisis, teens and adolescents go through. Through one character Sallinger is able to represent two very powerful and opposite things- what the 'mature adults' in the society do wrong and how young rebels who consider themselves unfit are unable to make any significant dents or offer any significant alternatives. Holden Caufield is an embodiment of the quote: "Every generation considers itself more intelligent than the previous one and wiser than the one about to come".This makes Holden such a compelling character.
