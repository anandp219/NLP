 Siddharth BhattacharyaRapes/sexual assaults are not necessarily increasing in India.When I came across the question, I saw answers blaming patriarchy, misogyny, objectification, wretched state of women in India as reasons. But these are causes of rape, not why they are increasing. Unless the society is following a trajectory as shown below (or another increasing function) these answers are wrong. However what maybe the truth is we are seeing cases of rapes more often in the news. I will therefore offer a perspective explaining this: Reporting rates have probably increased Media has finally decided to highlight issues such as rapes as headlines Society is shifting towards acknowledging rape as a pressing issue. Now that we've agreed, our eyes go towards such news more often. Despite the dismal environment, it may represent a minor ray of hope. Finally women can come out of their suppressed closets and report cases of harassment. Moreover the media has been able to stimulate the consciousness of society for once towards a real pressing issue. So the bottomline is - rapes always occured in huge numbers, it's one of the most pressing issues of our times, the fact that we're seeing them reported more often is probably a sign of hope as media is finally reporting it- successfully catching the attention of our eyeballs. PS. I don't believe blaming western media for increased objectification/ misogyny serves any real purpose. Even without them, these existed very much.
