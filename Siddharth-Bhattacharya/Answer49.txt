 Siddharth BhattacharyaI hate being preachy as once upon a time, I pissed off everyone with it. But since you raised the platform for discussion I thought the need to emphasize on an issue which even 'liberals' have hard time practicing. [EDIT: If you're seeing it on your feed, this is the question description: "I feel the way I was brought up the first 17-18 years of my life was very conservative. By logic, I understand that things in India especially regarding women need to change. But I find it difficult to change my mindset. What can I do?"]Don't pass on the blame to the 'other': The government is responsible for corruption, the rich & greedy for money-laundering, the media for unwanted sensationalism, the uneducated for committing all the rapes across the nation? When we pass on the blame to someone else for crimes happening in the society, we miss an opportunity to look within ourselves. But remember- whether it be the government or a random rapist on the street: they're all by-products of this society. Odds are if me or you were to be elected into the position of power, we'd have done the same as the government official. Considering the society we live in- where violence is sometimes forbidden and otherwise glorified and women are seen as inferior; odds are me or you could be a rapist. Yes, it's true. Unless we tame the devil within ourselves. Unless we remove that part of the society from ourselves which let the criminal commit the crime- in this case, our inclination to violence and disrespect for women we could've been him.(Image: We need teamwork as a society, not blame games)Changing mindset is a long task and one of the best ways to begin is- rather than pointing fingers, passing on the blame & denying our role in creating the monstrous society; take a moment to look within ourselves & purge that part of ourselves which has contributed to the crimes.
