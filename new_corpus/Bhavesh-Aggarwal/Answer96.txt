  The handstand push-up is generally best learnt practicing the two components in its name separately. Handstands and push-ups. Start with push-ups.If you can't do 2 sets of 20 chest-to-the-ground  perfect form  slow push-ups  don't even worry about the handstand version. Pay your dues with the basics before you think about an advanced move.Once you're confident with the push-up  work up to the same numbers with your feet on a knee-high object. For the next step  find an object that's just below hip height  and place your feet on it for push-ups.
