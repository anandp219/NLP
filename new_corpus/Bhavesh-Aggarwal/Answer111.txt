Divide that by four and we get 88 seconds per lap. Subtract 5  and your average lap time for the 800m is about 83 seconds. That amounts to a 166 seconds  i.e. 2:46 minutes 800m race. Finally  for the 400m  we would take 83 seconds per lap  subtract 5 again  and we get 78 seconds (1:18) for an open 400m race. Keep in mind  however  that many factors come together in each race  and they are run very differently. The method of building champion mile runners is vastly different from building champion 400m sprinters.
