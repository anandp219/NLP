They can be made harder by lateralizing and eventually doing them one-armed  as well as by raising the legs. Pull-ups Pull-ups are the yang to the yin of push-ups. They train the lats  the muscles around the scapulae  the rear deltoids  the elbow flexors  and the grip. If you do chin-ups  some of the work of the lats is transferred to the biceps instead  and so it will be more arm-oriented than a pull-up.
