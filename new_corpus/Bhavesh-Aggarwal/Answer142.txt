So the 3.67 is split into 2.44 for 0-10m  and 1.23 for 10m-20m  giving you an average speed of 4.1m/s and 8.2m/s respectively. We estimated about 9.2m/s as your max velocity  so the 20-30m segment was likely around 8.9 m/s (about 4% below your max)  so the 20-30m split was run in 1.14 seconds.Now  for your 50m time  we have calculated a total of 3.67+1.14+2.17 = 6.98Assuming that you slowed down about 5% from your max velocity over the next 50m  that gives us 1.085s*1.05*5= 5.69s for the last 50m.
