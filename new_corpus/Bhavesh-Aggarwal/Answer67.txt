If your workout isn't challenging you  you're not going to adapt. Apart from those basic three exercises  you might find it useful to do some specialized core work. People often do crunches till they nauseate  but I don't like them  as they don't build much abdominal strength. You're better off doing things like planks  side planks  sit-ups and leg raises. I personally think you don't need to incorporate abdominal exercises until you're capable of doing a push-up  a pull-up  and two-legged squat  as these will work your core too  just not as the main focus of your exercise.
