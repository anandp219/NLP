They contract relatively fast  and grow very big. Professional 800 meter runners have a lot of these.Type IIx (formerly known as Type IIb) are the fastest of the bunch. They contract fast  produce the most force per cross-sectional area  and fatigue very quickly. These are the fibers you need for short bursts of extreme power output  like a shot put  a 60 meter sprint  a vertical jump  or a hang clean. Their fuel economy is atrocious  however  and so  if you use these fibers often  without an absolute necessity for speed  some of them will convert to type IIb fibers.
