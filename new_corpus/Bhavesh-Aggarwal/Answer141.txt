Most likely  it was slightly higher.Junior athletes tend to reach max velocity at around 30m  and you might have held that for about 20m. That would give you a time of 2.17 seconds over your 30-50m segment. We assume that both 10m segements contained therein were run at the same speed  so 1.085 seconds each.If we allow for a max velocity/acceleration differential of 1.5 seconds (typical for junior athletes)  that means you run a 20m from standing in 3.67 (2.17 + 1.5) seconds. Generally  about two thirds of that time falls on the first 10m  and the other third accordingly on the second 10m.
