  For the purpose of this answer  I will assume that 'working out' means some form of strength training  rather than things like jogging  swimming  biking.The short answer is: No.Speed is a function of high force production in short amounts of time. In human physiology  that would be contracting a lot of muscle fibers as quickly as possible. Strength training helps you activate and build more muscle mass  which in turn allows you to produce more force. Clyde Hart  a sprints coach at Baylor Univerity even says:Strength and speed are synonymous.Considering the vast successes of his sprinters  men as well as women  we'd do well to heed his words.
