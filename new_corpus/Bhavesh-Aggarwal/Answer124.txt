Sprinting requires aggressive  powerful  and at the same time  controlled arm action to make their legs turn over faster.2. They help to put more force into the ground  thus allowing further and higher travel during a single stride.3. The upswing of the arms increases stride length by increasing the distance travelled in the air  which leads to a net gain because the air time doesn't change.
