Over time  find a less steep section  and eventually  you'll nail the kip-up on flat ground.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...I am able to do kip-ups  but I wouldn't consider myself a master of the skill yet. First of all  I am nowehere close to achieving one every time I try. Second  the arc of my back is not very pronounced  a direct result of me not getting enough air time  on account of lacking pushing strength and hip thrust. This in turn  affects my landing (very broad stance  a narrower stance makes it harder) and also in what direction I lean when I stand up (backwards in my case  which causes me to backpedal to keep my balance).Once you can do a clean kip-up with a good arc  a secure landing and a narrow stance  you can try the same thing with straight legs.
