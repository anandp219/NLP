The handstand push-ups can be done against a wall. For pike push-ups  around 2x15 is great  and even better is 2x5 handstand push-ups. Head to the ground and all the way back up  anything less is not full range of motion.Specific TrainingHere's how you do a kip-up. Sit down  feet out in front  knees slightly bent. Bring your back down quickly  placing your hands besides your ears and pull your knees up to your chest as fast as you can. This will whip you onto the upper back and hands. When you've reached maximum flexion of your body  push hard through the hands  and still keeping your knees bent  kick your feet upwards.
