Simple get up on your toes  and bend at the hips without rounding your back. You'll look like a jackknife from the side. Now do push-ups in that position. The bottom of a rep has your head lightly touch the floor. Keep your hands slightly wider than shoulder width  and keep your elbows from flaring out. Build the strength and endurance to do 2 sets of 15 reps before moving on the next step.Over time  work on elevating your feet with the pike push-up too. The highest you should raise your feet is the length of your upper body  measured from the waist to the top of your head.
