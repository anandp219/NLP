It's also important to train your core. As a rule of thumb  you should be hanging more like suspended pencil than a slab of meat.Increasing Reps with KippingNormally  you would want to do your pull ups strict and without any lower body movement. If you have reached your limit in the set  however  and want to do more pull ups  you can kip to get more repetitions under your belt. Over time  you will be able to do more repetitions without kipping. Never count the kipped reps as normal pull ups if you are keeping a training log  make a special note.
