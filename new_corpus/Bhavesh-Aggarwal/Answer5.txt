For rear deltoid exercises  I am partial to the pull-up. Sure  the rear deltoid head is not the prime mover. But again  you're using the muscles that should work together as a group  and in my mind  that trumps attempted isolation. If those are too easy for you  add some weight. You can also do elbow presses and reverse iron cross push-ups  but I don't find them as functional. Doing inverted rows  especially with raised feet  is a very good rear delt/lat/elbow flexor/grip exercise as well.Inverted rows with elevated feetAll in all  the military press is already a lot more balanced as a shoulder exercise than the dip  but you will especially want to add some rear deltoid work to keep your strength and size equal front to back.
