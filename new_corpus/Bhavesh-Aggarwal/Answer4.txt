I don't necessarily think a pure lateral head movement is necessary  and I consider the side lateral raise to be a somewhat odd exercise. In real life  you rarely ever lift things in that way. You can greatly improve the benefits if you do them one-sided only  and alternating hands between sets. Lots more core engagement!The same goes for the rear delt raise. I have literally never seen somebody lift anything up in a bent over position like that. Use muscle groups as they are meant to be used: In unision.
