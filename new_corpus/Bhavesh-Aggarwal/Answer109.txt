  Correlating mile times and 400m times is difficult  although not impossible. The requirements of these two races are different  and thus being good at one doesn't necessarily mean you are good at the other  even if there may be some carry-over from the grit and speed you develop in either of the races.Generally  the shorter races are better predictors for performance in longer races rather than the opposite  but the further apart two races are in distance  the weaker the correlation becomes  no matter in which direction we're calculating.
