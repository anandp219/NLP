That equates to 55.4 steps over the 100m  so an average step length of 1.80m. By the way  if we add 16% to this and multiply that by 4.4 steps per second again  we get your max velocity at 9.2m/s. The 16% is about the difference between average stride length and maximum stride length seen in 100m sprinters. Your height was 5'5"  i.e. 1.65m. That would give you an average leg length of 0.825m  although yours were probably a little longer. That gives us an average stride to leg length ratio of 1.8/.825=2.18Now that you're 5'8"  so 1.73m  your legs are .865m long.Applying the same ratio  your average stride length ratio is .865*2.2= 1.9mWith the same stride frequency  we get 1.9m/step*4.4 steps/s= 8.36m/sAt an average pace of 8.36m/s  your 100m time comes out to be 11.96 seconds.
