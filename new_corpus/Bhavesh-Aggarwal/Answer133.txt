  The BasicsAs you rightly said  you want to load up on carbs the days before  and take a high carb meal on the day of your race (starchy carbs about 2 hours before the competition  a banana 45 minutes before competition time). Be sure to hydrate well before the competition. 'Hydrate well'  according to the IOC nutrition panel report  means  drink around 700ml of water about 90 minutes before the competition.Keep sipping a sports drink (e.g. Powerade) throughout your race to keep up on carbs and water  your average rate should be around 1.5 bottles (assuming 500ml bottles) per hour.
