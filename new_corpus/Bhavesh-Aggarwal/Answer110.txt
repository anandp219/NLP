Otherwise  top sprinters would be able to become top marathoners too. There is a so called '5 seconds per lap' rule. That means every time you double the number of laps around the 400m track  you add 5 seconds to the time it takes you to run one lap within that race. Conversely  when you're going down in distance  you subtract 5 seconds.For a mile run (1'600m) your time was 5:55 minutes  i.e. 355 seconds.Because the mile is slightly longer than the 1'600m  we will subtract 3 seconds from that time to get an estimated 352 seconds (5:52 minutes) for the 1'600m.
