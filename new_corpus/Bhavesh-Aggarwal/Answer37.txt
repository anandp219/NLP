  Copied from: Bhavesh Aggarwal's answer to What is the best way to build muscle in upper-body and arms through push-ups?1. Go heavyThere's no doubt about it. If you want to build muscle  you need to challenge yourself. You need to use a weight that you can only complete a relatively small number of reps (5-12) with. In the context of calisthenics  unless you gain weight  the load in and of itself is not changing anytime soon. You can use a weighted vest or a resistance band to increase the load in your push-ups.
