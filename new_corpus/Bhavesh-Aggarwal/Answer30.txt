Don't be afraid to get into a scuffle with them if they threaten you or your buddies. Seriously  DON'T LET THEM PUSH YOU AROUND. ""Are you sure I should do tha-" "YES  I am bloody sure. Do you want to learn something or not? ""Okay  sorry. "I calm down again. "The same thing goes for Mom and Dad. Don't let them push you around. Tell Dad to get his stuff himself. Be firm  even mean  if need be. And don't let him cut your hair. EVER. And if he discounts your opinion  tell him straight up what you think of that.
