People rarely doubt me even when I am lying straight to their faces as my toddler eyes and pre-school smile lower their guards for me. Conversely  guys my age often think they can pick on me  because I look like an easy target. That can be a disadvantage or an advantage  depending on the situation. In some cases it helps to be underestimated.Thanks for the A2A  Chris Lo.
