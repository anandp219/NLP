Actually  the foot is held slightly plantarflexed (foot/shin angle increased to a little bit above 90 when you are in full stride)  and the toes are pulled up. That creates stability in the ankle  but also triggers the stretch reflex you need  as well as fast heel recovery. Keep in mind that a lot of things happen in that very short amount of time your foot is planted on the ground and your glutes and hamstrings are exherting forces. During ground contact  you pull with your glutes and hamstrings  you stabilize with your quads  and you push off with your calves.
