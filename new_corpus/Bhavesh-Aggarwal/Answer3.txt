Do pike push-ups first  and place your legs on increasingly higher objects. Your torso must always be vertical  or very close to vertical. Eventually  you can work on doing the handstand push-up against a wall. For an increase in challenge  you can work on lateralizing them  use a resistance band or weighted vest  and do them in a place that allows your head to go below the level of your hands (please be very careful  don't bash your head or injure your neck)Pike push-ups from a platform.As the other answerers have stated  you want to supplement the overhead press with some sort of rear deltoid dominant exercise.
