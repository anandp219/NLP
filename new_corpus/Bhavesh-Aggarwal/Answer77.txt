  A heart muscle can't get sore or fatigued the way other muscles do. The heart neither lengthens while contracting against a load (like when you're lowering into a squat)  nor does it fatigue until there are actually too few nutrients in the bloodstream to sustain contraction (which means you're pretty close to dying).If your upper pectoral area was hurting  it's either coming from your pecs  from another muscle  or from a different structure entirely. However  it's impossible for anybody to diagnose you over the Internet  so if you're worried  go to the doctor.
