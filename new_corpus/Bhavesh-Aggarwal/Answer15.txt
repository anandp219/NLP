  Taken from my answer:How do I increase my level of pull ups step by step?First  do vertical pulls:Work up to 2-3 sets of 30-40. This should be fairly easy for you.Horizontal pullsThese are a hard variation  but still a lot easier than a real pull up. Work up to 2-3 sets of 15-20. You can probably get away with doing fewer  but I still recommend you get at least 3 sets of 12.Chin upsThe chin up is the slightly easier brother of the pull up. The trick is to turn your palms to face towards you. This puts a little more load on the biceps than the lats and the posterior deltoid muscles  so most people have fewer problems doing them.
