  TL; DR No.You can't spot reduce fat by exercising the muscles in the vicinity. To lose fat on your belly and elsewhere requires eating the right way and exercising plenty. It helps to also drink a lot of water and get enough sleep.Focus on exercises that activate lots of (big) muscles  like squats  deadlifts  running  swimming  and biking.On the nutrition side  stick to whole foods that are as unprocessed as possible. It's not a perfect rule  but that way you will have a better idea of what goes into your body.
