Hence  that brings me to my next point...Nearly all landlords outsource the management of property in Australia to professional third parties. Property management is usually done by real estate agents in Australia; nearly every real estate agency has two arms: "selling" and "leasing". (Though some agencies specialise in one or the other. )Payment of rent is electronic; it's usually not even possible to pay rent via any other method in Australia. The idea of a landlord visiting a tenant to collect rent in cash is an entirely foreign concept to Australian landlords.
