One of the negatives  in my view  of a constitutional bill of rights is that these things then tend to be viewed as absolutes. For example  in Australia  one person's freedom of speech is balanced against a whole plethora of other considerations  such as the rights of minorities to feel safe in their environment  and I think courts generally balance these competing concerns very well. If we had the Westboro Baptist Church in Australia  I'm positive we'd find a way to stop them protesting soldiers' funerals - and I think that's a good thing.
