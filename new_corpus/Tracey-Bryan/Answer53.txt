But don't doubt for a moment that the vast majority of Muslims are as repulsed by these behaviours as the rest of the world. Their (apparent) silence should not be misinterpreted as complicity.If we manage to successfully eliminate terrorism side-by-side with our Muslim sisters and brothers  enough goodwill will have been generated for us to have the much more difficult conversations about reforming and modernising Islam.But right now  I'm sorry  I won't engage in a philosophical discussion about whether Islam is a net positive or negative  because it's entirely counter-productive.
