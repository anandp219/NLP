Some couples do everything together  others have many separate activities and don't even cohabitate. Some are totally open books to each other - sharing account passwords etc - and others maintain a lot of privacy. Some spend just as much time with their friends as when single  others stop doing any independent socialising. You need to ensure that your vision of your "coupleness" is at least compatible (by which I mean you are likely to be able to negotiate something that works for both parties  from those differing starting points).What your family is going to look like.
