  Primarily  it's helpful against corrosion. It's also lower maintenance; polishing needs to be done several times a year to keep looking good  whereas paint stays looking good for longer (dirt "washes off"). The reduced expense from this lower maintenance outweighs the cost incurred by the additional weight.US WWII military aircraft stopped being painted in late 1943 because the speed gain of lower weight was judged more important than the camouflage benefits of a paint scheme. So the B-29 changed its appearance from this:To this:Corrosion doesn't appear to have been a big consideration  which is logical: the planning timeframes when you're a military force fighting a war are much shorter than those for a commercial airline with life cycle cost concerns.
