  The realisation that everybody - including me! - is somebody's ideal partner and hottest fantasy. It's always worthwhile improving oneself - per Marcus' excellent answer - but I don't have to change myself  and be somebody other than I am  to be loved.I don't have to feign an interest in things that don't interest me  and downplay my "embarrassing" interests. I don't have to lose or gain weight  wear more or less makeup  be more socially adept  take up rock-climbing  dance better  wear different clothes  or do anything else that doesn't genuinely serve me in order to be worthy of somebody else's love.We are all worthy of love  just as we are.
