  I confess that this is a really hot topic for me; it touches on a whole lot of issues. I'll try to separate them out.It's often engaged in by parents who already have a lot of one gender  and want a child of the other gender. I hate to see parents saying this  because it tells the earlier children that they were somehow a "mistake"  or "not what we wanted". It doesn't matter how many times you say "Of course I love my boys  I just wanted a girl"  it's got to feel shitty being one of the boys of parents who openly proclaim how much they wanted a girl.
