There is far more complaint from American gun advocates about what we've done  than there is from Australians. Even Australian sporting shooters and farmers are largely on-side with our laws. There simply is no significant dissent or objection. We love our safe environment  and we're not going to be told by American gun advocates that we're oppressed or wrong  just because we don't sacrifice over 300 lives a day on the altar of a principle. We choose  happily  not to do that.
