  I've found the Quoracast  and having skype sessions with Quora employees due to my former role as an admin  a fascinating experiment  and have discovered that one forms an idea of what people's voices sound like  and that it rarely matches the reality.Marc Bodnick  Michelle Roses  Marcus Geduld  David Urquhart  and Jonathan Brill  all sounded very different than I'd expected. None of them sounded better or worse  just different. I'm sure this phenomenon has been studied  but my amateur take is that we create a "voice" for each personality as one of many ways of distinguishing individual personalities  and organising them in our memories.
