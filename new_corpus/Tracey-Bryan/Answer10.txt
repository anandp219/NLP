(Precluding some exceptional circumstance such as the pilot using a weapon and attempting to engage the enemy during descent. )You're right that there's no guarantee the pilot will surrender upon landing; the pilot must be given that opportunity  but is "fair game" if any hostile act is attempted. Protocol 1 to the Geneva Convention  Article 42  section 2 states: Upon reaching the ground in territory controlled by an adverse Party  a person who has parachuted from an aircraft in distress shall be given an opportunity to surrender before being made the object of attack  unless it is apparent that he is engaging in a hostile act.
