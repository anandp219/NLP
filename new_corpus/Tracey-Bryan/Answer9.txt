  Operation Mikado is not analogous to killing a downed pilot on the ground  because Operation Mikado was an attack designed to reduce the capacity of the Argentinians to engaged in air battle  i.e. had a valid military objective. A downed pilot has no plane with which to engage in air combat  and the targeting of such a pilot is not a legitimate military objective.A pilot descending in a parachute is already hors de combat (taken out of the battle). Military personnel are only ever able  under the laws of armed conflict  to use the minimum force necessary to render an enemy combatant hors de combat  so the application of any force against a pilot descending in a parachute would be unlawful.
