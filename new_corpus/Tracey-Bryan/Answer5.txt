  I would imagine Australian lenders technically have some of these powers  but I've never heard of them being enforced. For example  it used to be the case that the interest rate on your home loan was higher if you had a tenant in the property  than if it was owner-occupied. I haven't heard of that for the past 15 or 20 years  and I'd guess it's because it was never enforced.It's fine to rent our your home to a single family everywhere in Australia (as far as I know)  but there can be quite onerous restrictions if you wish to have multiple leases  such as leasing individual bedrooms.
