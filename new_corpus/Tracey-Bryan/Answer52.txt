We can't do that by "tarring all Muslims with the same brush"  we do it by focusing our criticisms on the terrorism that is our primary and shared concern.Let us also not forget that Muslims are overwhelmingly the victims of terrorism. Western outrage is what we primarily hear  but the victims of terrorism are nearly all Muslim. Muslims are at least as concerned about these behaviours as progressive western non-Muslims  but they don't have the freedom of speech that we are privileged to enjoy  and so we don't hear it.
