  The Australian Defence Force is well-equipped  highly-trained  and well-regarded internationally.Can it prevent anybody ever mounting a successful one-off attack against the Australian mainland?Well  given the size of our country  that's an extremely high bar to set. But even then  I think we're better-equipped to prevent even that  than most Australians would credit. Our intelligence and surveillance systems are extremely capable  and it's highly unlikely that we could be surprised. (Pearl Harbor-type surprise attacks are  in the context of the contemporary first world  nearly impossible.)
