(I have no idea why we create one voice as opposed to another  though. )It's quite a jarring experience  at first  and my initial reaction was: "oh my gosh  I really don't know that person that I thought I knew"  or "I don't know this person! "  but that's just a response to the conflict between your presumed voice and their actual voice. :) What I have found  though  is that by listening for a while  my "mental model" of a person rapidly adjusts to incorporate the actual voice  and I no longer experience that dissonance.
