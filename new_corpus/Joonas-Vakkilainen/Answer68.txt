First  locate the alveoli with the tip of your tongue (the [d] place)  then start a strong airflow and try to catch the tip of your tongue with it. Then  we should note that languages that are said to have a rolled r  often don't use it as much as said. Scots use mostly the flap  not the real rolled version. In Russian  you can manage very well just with the flap. Actually  palatalised [r] can't be a trill  the only way to pronounce it is to use a single flap (as in ). Finnish r is traditionally classified as a trill  though many Finns (depending on the dialect and idiolect) use just the flap in the short quantity.
