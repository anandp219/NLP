  This is one of the most typical misunderstandings about language. Most people  who have the accent of the region they live in  seldom think of their own accent. That's because they hear the same accent all the time. The majority of the locals speak in the same accent so they don't pay attention to it. When they meet a person who has moved from another region  they immediately notice it because it is something that doesn't follow their norm. If the accent is also used in the national media  it really appears to be a norm.
