In addition  languages within one group can be conservative in some features and more advanced in some other features. Finnish is phonologically mostly more conservative than Estonian  but Estonian has not diphthongised its mid vowels (noor tmees) unlike Finnish (nuori tymies)  and is thus more conservative in this feature. Different Finnish dialects differ in the degree of phonological conservatism so the general degree of the Finnish conservatism is varying. Knowing this  with which argument we could call Finnish an older language than Italian or Swedish or English?
