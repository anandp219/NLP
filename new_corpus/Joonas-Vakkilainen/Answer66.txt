  There is already a lot of practical advice for the technique of the trill  but let's focus on phonetics for a moment. It is easier to approach new sounds by linking them to sounds you already know. When people speak of rolled r's  they usually don't differentiate between the actual trill [r] and the flap []. The latter one is already familiar to Americans but it is used differently in the American English phonology from many other languages. In American as well as in some other Englishes  it is an allophone of unstressed intervocalic /t/ and /d/  as in latter and ladder.
