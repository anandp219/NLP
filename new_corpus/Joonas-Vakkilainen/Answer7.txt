Another example is that degree programs for Chinese teachers has been started at University of Helsinki. They have already had the Chinese language degree program  but now students of Chinese language can specialise on becoming teachers. The same is now possible for Japanese as well. In the future  there will be educated Finnish-born Chinese language teachers in our schools.
