  That's because every living language is as old. Every language has evolved from earlier proto-languages. Some languages have more innovations than others. Because of that  we call some languages more conservative than their living relatives. This conservatism can't be measured outside of the language family. There is no point comparing whether Finnish is more conservative than Icelandic because they belong to different families and therefore there is no reference point. We can say that Icelandic is much more conservative than other Scandinavian languages and that Finnish is more conservative than many Uralic languages but we can't compare those conservative features together.
