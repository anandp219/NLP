  As Mikhail Kotykhov noted  there are two stages of practicing pronunciation: tjhe "mechanical" way where you produce the sounds in isolation  and "dynamic" way where you use those sounds as a part of the language. My advice is to do both. The more difficult the sound is and the more different it is from your native language  the more energy you must pay on to handle with it. If the sound is physically alien to you (such as implosives or clicks)  you need to make yourself familiar with the technique.
