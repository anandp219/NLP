If we look at Germanic loanwords  we can see that Finnish is conservative there  too  and thus claim  though a bit carefully  that it is more conservative than languages of another language family  at least phonologically. The Proto-Germanic word *kuningaz is kuningas in Finnish but kung/konung in Swedish  king in English and Knig in German. The Old Norse /au/ diphthong is still the original diphthong in Finnish  but it has changed in Scandinavian languages: Swedes say kpa ('to buy') (that has affrication   too) but Finns say kauppa ('shop  trade').
