'You like cats''You' is the theme: wa indicates that we are going to say something about you. The sentence tells about liking  and English expresses that with a verb and its object. Japanese  however  uses an adjective there: suki ('favourable'). Because of that  the sentence doesn't have an object. It has a subject that tells what is favourable. This word is marked with nominative (if there is no need to use it as a topic). The last word of the sentence is often called a copula verb ('to be') but it is more like a grammatical element that marks the predicative.
