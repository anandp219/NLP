That's why you need usage practice to make your sound system automatic. A good way to master the pronunciation of floating speech is to read texts aloud. In that situation  you don't need to concentrate on the meaning  grammar or communicational things. You can just think of the pronunciation. This is like the middle ground between the isolation practice and the conversational practice. When you notice that you have problems with some sounds or patterns in conversational speech  you can go back to texts and "locate" the problem and practice it more without disturbance.
