  The safety level of a martial art depends on how you practice it. Of course there are hard and soft styles  but none of the modern arts should break your body. I practice Judo  too  and I don't have problems with my body. Nowadays  competitive judokas train in a way which is not ideal. The idea of Judo is to be safe. A remarkable matter in conducting Judo throws is to pay attention to your stance: if your back is crooked and knees to wrong directions  you are causing harm to your body. A good technique is pleasant both to tori and uke.
