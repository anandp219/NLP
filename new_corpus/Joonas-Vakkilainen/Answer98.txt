When Scots language is written  it is done by using modified English spelling to show the differing Scots sounds and pronunciations. Otherwise the text would just look like English with some Scottish lexicon and grammar.A more moderate way of divising a separate language is standardisation. When a country wants to differ from its close relatives  the norms of written language are made as different as possible from its neighbours. This was done in the former Yugoslavian countries that were said to have Serbo-Croatian as their language.
