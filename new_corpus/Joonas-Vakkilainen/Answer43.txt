Aikido has basically the same techniques as every martial art. Combat hapkido  which is a self defense and real life focused modern martial art  uses many same techniques as aikido but it uses them in a self defense way. If you practice aikido long enough with the focus on self defense  it is possible that you will learn effective self defense. Though  in that case it may not be aikido any longer that you are practicing. My aikido sensei says that as a self defense  aikido is a long path and you should not choose it if you want to learn effective self defense fast.
