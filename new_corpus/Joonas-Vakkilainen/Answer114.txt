'At three o'clock  I will go by train from Asahikawa to Kyoto'The difference between the two kinds of particles in Japanese becomes visible in combinations. Topic marker can be added after a postposition:Nihon ni onsen ga aru.Nihon ni wa onsen ga aru.The first sentence just tells that 'there are hot springs in Japan'. The second sentence has marked the locative as the topic  making the meaning 'it is Japan where there are hot springs'. So  these are particles. In my answer  I have focused mostly on their morphological side.
