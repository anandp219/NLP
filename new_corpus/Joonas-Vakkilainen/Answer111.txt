  Japanese has two kinds of particles: case markers and postpositions. Case markers indicate nominative  accusative and topic  and postpositions tell something about the state of the word: location  direction  instrument  time etc. Case markers tell what the grammatical relation of the word is. Wa marks the topic of the sentence. Ga represents nominative. O marks accusative  which means that the word is the direct object of the verb.Judith Meyer provided an example of the usage of case markers in a sentence  but her linguistic interpretation is not accurate:Anata wa nego ga suki desu.
