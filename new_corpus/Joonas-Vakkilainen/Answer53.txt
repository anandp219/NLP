There is Hungary!" It is true that the people who later formed the Hungarian nation came to the region of modern Hungary relatively late (which is proven for example by the absence of big dialectical differences)  but of course they didn't arrive as a single group in a single year. There have also been attempts to prove Hungarians to be linguistic and genetic relatives of Huns  Sumerians and other great cultures  and not of "less noble" Uralic nations. On the other hand  in Japan it would be terrible to claim that the Japanese would be immigrants.
