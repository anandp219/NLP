At least it did it to me.Aikido also gives good insight into using the directions and trajectories  which too often are replaced with raw power. One of my judo senseis  who was an olympic judoka earlier  said that first he was a sportsman who needed to train hard in order to be successful. He found judo really difficult and himself very bad at it. Then he got acquainted with other martial arts such as aikido and began thinking teachings himself. He stopped training sport. He did just judo: he practiced kata  taisabaki and stance (like jigohontai).
