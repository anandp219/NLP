  Finnish almost never uses honorifics. T-V distinction exists  but it is mostly restricted to customer service  particularly when the customer is old. Jaana Kapari-Jatta  the awarded Finnish translator of Harry Potter told in her book about the Harry Potter translation that she had to ponder whether to use T-V distinction in Finnish. Teachers in HP are addressed by using the title professor  which would be a natural place for the V forms. She decided to use only T forms  because it wouldn't be natural for Finnish children if students are calling their teachers with V.Finnish doesn't use honorific lexicon much.
