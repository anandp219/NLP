It should not be used as the measure of "correctness".English doesn't have a very big difference between the spoken and written language  and thus the old prescriptive rules remain quite arbitrary  but they are still supposed to be stylistic  not something that should replace the way people talk in their everyday life. In some languages  like Finnish and Norwegian (nynorsk)  the written language is artificially constructed in order to be equal to every dialect and social group  and in this case  the formal rules are not just random stylistic norms as in English.
