The resultative olen ampunut karhun harvoin means that the speaker has some rare experiences of shooting and killing a bear.To the end I'll present one kind of weird example  which I think suits here well. Irresultative verbs can be made resultative with some adverbials. For example: rakastan karhua ('I love the bear'  irresultative by nature) vs. rakastan karhun kuoliaaksi ('I love the bear to death'  resultative). It would be possible to say harvoin rakastin karhun kuoliaaksi  meaning 'I rarely loved a bear to death'  where the speaker has had several bears as pets and seemingly he has sometimes loved them to death but not always.
