The philosophy turned around: in bujutsu  mental training was a helping method for the combat  whereas in budo  the physical techniques are a helping method for the mental development. When speaking of aikido  we must observe it in the latter sense. Aikido is not meant to be a way to fight in a combat. The name  aikid can be translated as 'the way of meeting with ki'. For some people ki is a mystical  spiritual thing  but from a physical point of view  it means actually the way how you place yourself in relation to your opponent and how you maintain your stance.
