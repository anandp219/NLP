I guess that my birthplace was first just a stateless space between them. My town was founded in 1779 by the Swedish king Gustaf III  on the border of the provinces of Turku & Pori and Tavastia. Nowadays  Tampere is considered a part of Tavastia. Though  provinces do not exist any longer  and the region Tampere is located in is Pirkanmaa (Birkaland in Swedish). Sometimes the name Northern Tavastia is used in this sense.Between the years 1397-1523  the Kalmar Union was the only country in Scandinavia + Finland.
