To the speakers of the "norm" accent  this creates an illusion of their accentlessness. To the speakers of "non-norm" accents  the accent used in media may sound either annoying ("that's the accent of those capital city jerks") or something desirable ("that's how successful and cool people speak"). Because of that  the speakers of non-media accents probably don't think they don't have an accent themselves. They may still consider their personal accents milder than they in reality are. This is not just an American thing.
