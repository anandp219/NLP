For example  when contrasting with my language  English has two "a sounds"  both which I would without practicing judge to be the same. In American English  the vowels in sock and suck are pretty close to each other  at least if you ask me. If you are not familiar with this distinction  it is important to practice that kind of words in order to make the distinction clear.As Mikhail wrote  the technical practice alone is not enough. When people are drunk  they often speak more dialectically or with a stronger foreign accent than they sober do.
