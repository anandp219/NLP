  The sentence is grammatical. Generally  "rarely" can be used with both resultative and irresultative aspect  but let's check it in different situations. (The word order of the clause will vary in my examples but it is not relevant here. )The sentence in the question has the object karhua in partitive  which indicates irresultative aspect. It would work just fine in context such as nin usein mkkini lhell liikuskelleen karhun  ammuin karhua harvoinwhich means 'I often saw the bear going nearby my cottage  I rarely shot at the bear'.
