'Saturday' is lauantai in Finnish but lrdag in Swedish and laugardagur [li-] in Icelandic  which has retained the spelling but changed the pronunciation. This leads us to Icelandic. Among the Germanic languages  it is really conservative. It has retained the grammatical cases  personal conjugation  the phonemes  and  and it has not merged masculine and feminine into uter unlike the most continental variaties  and it also has (artificial) lexical conservatism. Icelandic has not changed much during the time it has had written language  so it is what people like to call "old".Lithuanian is always referred to when speaking of historical comparative Indo-European research because it has retained many features that have vanished in other IE languages.
