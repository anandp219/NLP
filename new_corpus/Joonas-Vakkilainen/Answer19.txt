  My birthplace and current place of residence is Tampere in Finland. Before the ancestors of the Finnish people came in  the place was inhabited by the ancient Samis. Their legacy can be found in some place names.Ancient Finns consisted of different tribes  whose locations became historical provinces. My region was the province of the Tavastians (hmliset)  and the historical province is thus Tavastia; Hme in Finnish  Tavastland in Swedish. By the 1200s  Sweden had came in. First  Sweden was in charge in the south-western Finland (which actually was the only Finland)  and Novgorod in the eastern part.
