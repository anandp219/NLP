So far  Raag Tilak Kamod  Bageshree  and Hamsadhwani have really helped in lifting my spirits. Maalkauns  Behag and Komal Rishabh Asavari are very touching and I find myself moved to tears quite often by them. (These tears are happily emotional!). Ahir Bhairav is meditative. So is Bhairav and Todi. I am listening and maintaining a diary of the effect of music on me! I would some day love to expand this research on others to see if the results match. Additionally  I am fascinated by the sound of language.
