I am not very sure  but this is probably the reason why I am always attracted to older men! Boys my age are well  boys. How does it feel? I have learnt to be OK with my physical beauty. Thank it and be OK with men getting attracted because of that. As I grow in my life's journey  I accept and understand that physical attraction plays a major role in humans connecting and it is a good thing. I have also learnt to take compliments gracefully. Even though I did suffer some traumatic incidents  I'd rather have this privilege than not have it.
