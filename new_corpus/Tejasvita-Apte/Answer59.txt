Neither is superior or inferior to the other. End of the day they are all definitions and they are all beliefs. Every belief is true for the believer. For the purpose of this answer  I am referring to physical beauty when I use the word 'beauty'. I started out hating my physical beauty owing to some traumatic incidents in my childhood. Growing up  for long  I perceived a conflict between beauty and intelligence. Like you could only have one of the two. If someone complimented me for my beauty I would snap at them to say that I'd rather be known for my intellect.
