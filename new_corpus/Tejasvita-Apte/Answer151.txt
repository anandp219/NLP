Totally. An extremely funny person  she quickly becomes the life of the group! Given that we were staying in the same hotel  we chatted well past midnight! It was great talking to her and like I told her  I never felt like we were conversing for the first time! This meetup will forever be cherished! Warm and wonderful memories... :) Thank you again  AXIS team for inviting me. Here is a click with the awesome audience and organizers of the meet. The next day I was asked to judge Model United Nations conference organized by VNIT.
