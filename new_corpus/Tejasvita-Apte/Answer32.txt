  Any artistic pursuit is often backed by intellectual and emotional investment. I would imagine the same with music. As a lover of music with a keen ear  I can only speculate. Every piece of art comes into existence when the creator experiences something which she wishes to express differently. A person skilled in the art of painting uses colours and a brush to express the same. A person skilled in music  uses sound and arranges the notes in such a manner that he creates magic with it. But he is also choosing to express.
