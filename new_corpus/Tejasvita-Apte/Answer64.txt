Muslim women cannot adopt a child.If you are a Hindu and if you wish to make a will  you cannot give away your ancestral property. You can do what you want with your self acquired one. If you are a Muslim  you cannot give away more than 1/3rd of your property by will anyway. In case you die without making a will (intestate succession)  the devolution of your property will take place based on your religion. So  if you are a Hindu  Hindu succession Act will apply. The only option for you if you do not want to these laws to apply to you is to convert into another religion in which case the laws of that religion would apply.
