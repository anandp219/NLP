HarassmentI have been molested and have encountered many incidents where I was groped at and harassed. This isn't uncommon. Because I was a fair and beautiful child  I was molested even as a child and that was quite traumatic. It took me years to be OK with my body. It took me years to be OK with my physical beauty. Somehow I had associated it with being harassed. I had internalized the blame and took no efforts to look nice. In fact I deliberately dressed down. My teens were gone in wearing baggy jeans and dirty T's.
