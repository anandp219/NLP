Do give it a listen. I am quite a fan of his voice! 2. Yaad piya ki aye (Thumri) by Kaushiki Chakrabarty - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...One of my favorite thumris. You will find a lot of fusion versions of this one. Some of them are worth listening too. 3. Koyaliya bole Ambwa by Pandit D.V. Paluskar (Drut Bandish in Raag Tilak Kamod)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...I am in love with Kamod itself! It is therapeutic I tell you! And his voice is very sweet.
