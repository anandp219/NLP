In fact  in every photo of mine  I look extremely different. Here is a photo - With intellect  I have been taking efforts for long. Since childhood. Books have been my best friends and I have had intellectual pursuits all my life. Although I never aced exams  I was excellent with knowledge. In college and later  people have been coming up to me with questions and I have had a very satisfying journey as a teacher of law. There are perks as well as flip sides. Perks of being attractive - People notice you.
