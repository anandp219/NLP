  Thank you for asking me to answer this question Vishwathika. I also have to mention two other people who requested me to answer this. Thank you. As agreed  I am not tagging you! I do not consider myself highly anything. But well yes  I do think I am above average. I was also battling whether I should really be answering this but then decided to take a stab anyway. I decided because I realized that we are not encouraged to embrace our physical beauty (At least in my case). Somehow we are taught to be ashamed of it.
