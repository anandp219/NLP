  By listening to understand and not react. This is the key of any debate. Not just debate  but even conversations. If only we listen to understand and not react  we can learn a lot. We are truly open minded and we can have a really satisfying conversation / debate. Next time you debate  just remind yourself this - You are listening to understand another perspective. A perspective that clearly matters to another human being and therefore is worthy of being understood. Then respond. And again  I use my words judiciously.
