If you feel that pain  you would find it in your heart to forgive yourself as well as others (if they have wronged you in any manner. Because I know that often  underneath one wrong  there is another one and the cycle continues. It may not be that girl you troubled  it could be someone else. Whoever or whatever that is  forgive that too. Or you would never move on).This has been one of the greatest lessons of my life too. Responsibility  remorse and forgiveness.
