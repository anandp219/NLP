There were puns  jokes  interesting insights and a lot of warmth and happiness shared. I was also happy again to connect to Niharika and Ankush whom I had met before in the IIT Bombay event. Meeting Aishwarya was amazing. I had been reading some of her answers and knew about her through Quora before. True to her image  Niharika is intelligent  interactive  energetic and easy to talk to. Ankush is witty  funny and a very nice person. The three of us girls had a nice time teasing him. :) Aishwarya  is unlike her image.
