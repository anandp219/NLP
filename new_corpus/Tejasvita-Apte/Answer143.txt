Till the enactment of the law  the CVC was receiving and acting upon complaints. The law received President's sanction in May 2014. Following is why I say it is a toothless legislation - 1. No definition of 'Victimization' - The law doesnt define 'victimization'. In once instance  it indirectly limits it to victimised by initiation of any proceedings or otherwise. {Refer Section 11(1)}The definition of 'victimization' ought to be very wide.2. Limited definition of 'Disclosure' - {Refer section 3 (d)}The Act defines disclosure thus "disclosure" means a complaint relating to (i) an attempt to commit or commission of an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act  1988; (ii) wilful misuse of power or wilful misuse of discretion by virtue of which demonstrable loss is caused to the Government or demonstrable wrongful gain accrues to the public servant or to any third party; (iii) attempt to commit or commission of a criminal offence by a public servant  made in writing or by electronic mail or electronic mail message  against the public servant and includes public interest disclosure referred to in sub-section (2) of section 4.
