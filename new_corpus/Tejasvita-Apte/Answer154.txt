  This isn't a fun or sweet answer  but a serious one. Deception starts at a very young age. A lot of it is unintentional of course  but it contributes on the whole. When a parent feels angry at the child and instead of healthily expressing it  shows love  it's deception. Express anger (albeit healthily) and your child will know that her actions can evoke anger in people and she will then have to deal with the consequences of it. She will also understand that it is Okay to be angry and express it.
