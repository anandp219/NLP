  Parents are the first figures of authority in a child's life. Nearly all of the mental foundation of a human is formed in childhood. (Despite this  I strongly believe that nothing possibly short of taking another human's life is irreparable. You can mend anything within yourself when you decide to). Since relationship with parents is the first relationship any child experiences  most times  all our relationships later in life tend to mimic the first two. Either they are the same  or just the opposite.
