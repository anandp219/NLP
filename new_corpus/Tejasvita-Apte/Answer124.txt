Cheating according to me happens in many forms. There is the cheating by contempt  cheating by neglect  cheating by emotional affairs  and cheating by indifference. Sexual cheating hits worst. More so for men and I believe the reasons for this are very very interesting but since they are not the topic of this answer  I will not go there. Know and understand that sexual cheating will break him and fixing it is a task. Immediately in the aftermath of an affair  there is an upsurge of sexual activity between the couple.
