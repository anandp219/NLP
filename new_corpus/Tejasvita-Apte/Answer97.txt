  I think the wisdom of Godfather doesn't come from any theory or thought. (Much as I would like to theorize about it!). It comes from action. From being in that situation where 'you've got to do what you've got to do! 'A person who once struggled for food is going to have a very different outlook towards life than a person who doesn't even know what it is like to struggle for food. A person who hasn't eaten anything for days isn't going to think it is unethical to steal. This was with reference to Don Corleone.
