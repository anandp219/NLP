But I do hope to go back to trying it again to see the impact of death metal on me some day. Similar has been my journey with Indian classical music. I have been using it on myself for therapeutic purpose for quite some time now. I have also made it a point to not read about the purpose before hand. This helps me in making sure that my mind is not prejudiced by my reading of therapeutic advantages of Indian classical music. If it helps it helps  if it doesn't it doesn't. I wouldn't want a placebo!
