  And Islamic invasion and demolition of the Temple in Ayodhya was a precursor for the Babri Masjid Demolition. Or the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits in 1989 was a precursor for the demolition. Can I say that?I mean the foolish arguments would become endless then  wouldn't they?So  do not buy the nonsense politicians come up with. Rioting is different from planting a bomb and waging war against the state. Demolition of a monument is not the same as planting a bomb and killing innocent civilians. Law deals with both separately and that is already being done.
