Don comes to America as an immigrant and builds his way up. He knows what it feels like to not have food. His ethics and his morals are very different from others. Similar situation is that of Michael when he very reluctantly enters the family business. He does what he has to do. He does what he can do best when he is pushed to a corner. I don't think there is much philosophy or wisdom there in Godfather except the fact that what you become depends on the choices you make. And both the father and the son are very clear about it.
