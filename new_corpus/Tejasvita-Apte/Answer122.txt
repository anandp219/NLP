A lot of people feel apologetic for hurting their spouse but don't necessarily feel apologetic for the affair itself. There is a difference. Key difference. Introspect and find out what do you feel apologetic about. Don't judge yourself  just introspect. Don't tell yourself what you "should" be feeling. Just find out what you actually feel. If you do not regret the affair  your relationship with your husband is far worse than you think. If this is truly the situation  then you need to check why do you wish to live with him.
