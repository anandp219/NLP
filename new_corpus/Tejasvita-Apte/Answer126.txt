I know this is hard  but the details are only going to hurt you more. So  control that temptation. Questions like "Was he better than me?  How did you do it? Which position? Where? How many times? "  all of these need to be curbed. Instead  ask the questions that really will make a difference. Ask the person what the affair meant to her. How did she feel in that relationship that she couldn't in the first one. What was going through her mind before and after it. Ask these kind of questions which will help you both see as to what the affair meant.
