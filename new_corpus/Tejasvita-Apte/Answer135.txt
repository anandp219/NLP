Music is subtle. Words as media aren't as subtle. They have meaning. They have a form. Word 'x' can only have one meaning. It's fixed. Music goes beyond. It has no meaning. Notes have impressions. They are different for different people. They have no definitions. Personally  I am not as touched by words as I am by music. Music has the power to make me feel euphoric or bring me to tears. Anything. We listen to music with our muscles  says Nietzsche. We not only listen through our ears  but our whole body  unknowing to us  listens to music.
