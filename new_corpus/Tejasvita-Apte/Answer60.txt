It took some time but I realized both were biological accidents. Beauty as well as brains. And considering one as superior to the other was stupid. What was truly my own were my efforts. Whether they were towards my mind or body didn't matter. Having been raised by parents who encouraged the pursuits of the mind much more than the body  I obviously ended up loving my mind more. Books were my food and intellectual pursuits my life's biggest pleasures. I didn't allow myself to feel beautiful because that didn't matter.
