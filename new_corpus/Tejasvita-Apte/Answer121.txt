Remember a lot of relationships merely survive an affair. Do you really want just survival? Or do you want a beautiful relationship much better than what existed before the affair? Aim for the latter. For you (The person who had the affair) - 1. You need to stop the affair. First step. Tell your partner it's over. In that process  if you have to let go off some of your freedom  do it. 2. Apologize for hurting him. Now there are two parts to this apology and you therefore need to inquire into yourself.
