I am a classic case of 'absent minded' prof! So  even when I do consider myself intelligent  I don't think I am very smart. I am also a scatter brain and I tend to get bored quickly if there is no intellectual stimulation. The biggest problem with this is when I have to do mundane tasks. I suck at it. Also  being intelligent becomes quite lonely. I have very little patience for banal chit chat and most often in a huge group  I withdraw simply because my talk is deemed unnecessarily 'too intellectual for mortals'.
