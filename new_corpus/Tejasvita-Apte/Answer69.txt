Because despite being God  Krishna is killed by a stray arrow. Despite winning  the Pandavas are never happy and finally renounce the throne. Despite winning  Krishna is cursed by Gandhari and the curse comes to fruition. Despite losing  Karna is the greatest lamented hero and is lauded by one and all. Mahabharata never says the heroes won and end of story. It tells you that even for the heroes to win  every commander of the Kaurava Army had to be killed unethically. It tells you that despite his faults  Duryodhana was known for his generosity to friends and despite his greatness  Yudhishthir had a weakness for dice games and over-pragmatism (Ok  that is my opinion!!).
