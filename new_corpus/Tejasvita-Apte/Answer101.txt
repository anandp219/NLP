It takes you out of your comfort zone. Out of known waters. Out of the convenience of familiarity. Personally  I would any day embrace freedom with the responsibility rather than the lack of both but not many choose that even when they can. And I can understand the temptation. This is the biggest benefit women have in patriarchy. Lack of responsibility. It takes courage to be free. Not all of us are ready for it. Having said that  let me also say that this answer is an observation. Not a springboard for generalized blame or condemnation.
