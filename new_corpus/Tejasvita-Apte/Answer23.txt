Believe me  the man walks  talks and lives history. I have witnessed it personally! People have accused him of all sorts of things. My point from the beginning has been  if you think a person's work is not credible  write critical analysis of the same. Peer- review it. Do your own research. Write books criticizing his. But his critics include organizations like Sambhaji Brigade. Well  what can you say about hooligans who are only capable of breaking and vandalizing institutes like 'Bhandarkar Institute' in Pune and nothing more than that?We possibly can't expect them to even understand what Babasaheb has written let alone peer-review it.
