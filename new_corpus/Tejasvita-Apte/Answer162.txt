Flip side of being attractive -Since she is good looking  obviously she won't have brain - Many times  the biggest misconception a lot of people have when they first meet me is this. I encountered that sentiment the most when I was practicing in courts. For some reason  people presumed I wouldn't be intelligent and didn't shy away from showing surprise when I argued and kicked their ass in court! One incident is very distinct in my mind. I was arguing against a very senior advocate. It was a simple argument of maintenance for my client.
