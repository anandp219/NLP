So  this belief is imperative for my survival. I can be wrong - At the base of every belief I have is skepticism. I have read  got convinced  argued  tried to convince others of many theories  some of them my very own! But I have also been very open to change. To some people around me  that's shifting loyalty. To me  that's evolving! And of course the universe has given me plenty of examples that most often the simplest conclusions  or my first impressions were right. So  I may not be wrong all the time!
