There is a lot of social pressure. Well  I am breaking it and answering this question! In my country  I am considered attractive for two reasons - Firstly because I have fair skin (by Indian standards of course). Sadly  that is the definition of beauty for most Indians. Secondly  because I have symmetrical features. That seems to be something most people in the world term attractive and I too find myself attracted to men with symmetrical features. Other than that  there isn't anything much. I have to also say that I am not at all photogenic.
