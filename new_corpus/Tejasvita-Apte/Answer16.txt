A lot of things that are taught are essentially Hindu. Hindu festivals are celebrated. Soldiers are sent 'Raakhis'*. Children are taught Yoga and other healthy things. Indian arts and culture is promoted. Malla Khamb and traditional Indian body building is taught. Beyond that wherever there is a natural disaster  help is provided. RSS men often have been the first ones to respond. RSS volunteers often aid the Army in rescue operations. Cleanliness drives are conducted. For intellectual stimulation  speeches of scholars from all walks of life are organized.
