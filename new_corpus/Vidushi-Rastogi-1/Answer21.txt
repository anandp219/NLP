Imagine evenings when your friends are lying on couch drinking   eating and laughing while music plays. We have a literal ROFL moment almost everyday. It is not that we don't have problems   it is just we don't let them grow over us. We don't bring professional woes when we are together   though we discuss when it is required. We don't bicker over tiny issues. We give each other necessary space and respect privacy. We try to stay together.Here is our picture :)L --> R Vishal   Harsh   Me and Amit.
