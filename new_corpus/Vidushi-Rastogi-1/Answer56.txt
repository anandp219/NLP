I also met couples where one partner was all healthy and helped in managing the challenges of the other partner. They were happy people  seemingly normal  talked about happy things  looked beautiful and were OPTIMISTIC. IMHO  you should focus more on managing your challenges  stabilizing both T1D & SD. Feel good about yourself and love will come following. Learn about people who are fighting the same challenge and winning hands down. It will boost your morale. Shun everybody who makes you feel deficient.
