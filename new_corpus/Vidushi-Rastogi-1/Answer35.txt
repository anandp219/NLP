  My ring finger bears the tattoo of my husband's name  Harsh (he was my boyfriend then and later fiancee for sometime).I got it because  I always wanted to. It was his birthday gift. This might sound cheesy and overly romantic to some but I could never think of anything but his name to get permanently inked.Some quipped me over it that I took PDA to another level  some commented that I am inspired by a growing trend among celebrities  others thought that I could use it to emotionally blackmail him.
