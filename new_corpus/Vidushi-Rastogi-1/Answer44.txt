The figures may not be high for developing countries but a large number of startups are preferring freelancers over permanent employees. Experts attribute this shift to passion for work and flexibility attached with freelancing. Many permanent employees have found that they are more productive and creative when they are not attached with long-term employer. Their ability to think out of box is enhanced when they are working with new employer for a brief stint. Thisno-strings-attached model is gathering momentum in almost all domains  be it industry or corporates.
