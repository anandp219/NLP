In these areas  not only will no one mock you  I rather suspect that very few will even particularly notice.Regarding the other areas  I hope someone who is more directly familiar will answer  but I do note this: even though an area like Tower Hamlets has a Muslim population of around 100 000 (35%) and should be presumed to be more conservative on gay issues  there are reasons to think you'd be fine there. First  some quick googling shows that there are a few gay bars and pubs in Tower Hamlets. And second  the taboo against same-sex holding hands is not really a Muslim thing anyway.
