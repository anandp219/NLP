  No. The Philippines does not have a royal family. It is a Presidential constitutional republic with a democratically elected government and no hereditary head of state.The land of the Philippines is under diverse ownership by many different people  organizations  and governmental units.You probably heard about this through some hoax information about a self-styled "Prince Julian Morden Tallano". There appears to be very little evidence to back his claims  and the entire weight of history against it.
