  I believe the fastest human-made object currently is the Juno spacecraft which reached a maximum speech of 38 000 km/h. A ship habitable by 1000 people would be much larger and much harder to engineer to get up to those speeds  but let's assume it could be done in the reasonably near future.Now let's figure out where these fine folks could go. As it turns out  no where interesting. Traveling at that speed for 2000 years gets you a long way away by human standards: 666 billion kilometers.But by galactic standards  that's nothing: about 0.07 of a light year.
