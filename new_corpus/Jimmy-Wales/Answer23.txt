  There are several reasons: 1. I'm extremely busy with TPO and not really willing to give up a year of my life full-time for a political campaign.2. I'm not a Republican. I'd make a more plausible Republican than Larry  so if we were to launch 2 campaigns  me the Republican  him the Democrat  that would make some sense. But I'm not a Republican.3. I find being in the public eye relatively unpleasant. And to enter politics in the United States could invite a pretty unpleasant harassment of my family.4.
