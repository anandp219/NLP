  Whether you get in or not may be a matter of luck depending on whether they check ID. But in my experience  in London  if they do ask for ID (or if they ask your age and you tell the truth)  they will be very strict.I once tried to take my daughter  age 13 at the time  to a movie rated 15. They asked her age at the ticket booth and she told the truth. That was that  they were very insistent that it was impossible. I was surprised because in the US there is generally no actual law about this - it's a convention and the rule is that for R rated (18) movies  minors have to be accompanied by a parent.
