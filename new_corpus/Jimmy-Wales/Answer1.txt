  If we assume that the change is being done without any intention to change the overall constitutional structure and balance of power  so that the new role of President has very close to the same powers and responsibilities of the Monarchy  then there's obviously no one more qualified and respected and safe in the role than the Queen.However  even if the intention is to make no change in the overall power structure  there is a strong likelihood that an elected President would feel a public mandate to exercise some of the theoretical but traditionally unused powers of the office.
