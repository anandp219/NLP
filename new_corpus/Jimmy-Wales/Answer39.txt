There is a sense that if you donate enough money to a political party in the UK  through a system that isn't fully corrupt but looks questionable enough to many people  you may be rewarded with some kind of title - a knighthood/damehood or a peerage title. None of those are really *royal* titles  though.Second  the titles that are for sale are either from pretty much made-up nations like Sealand - such that I'd call them an Internet scam  or there are these odd "Lord of the Manor" titles that make you seem like a jerk if you buy one and try to use it.
