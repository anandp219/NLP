  I've failed many a times personally and professionally! I do have responsibilities too waiting for me. I feel terrible about personal failures  just terrible. 1. I'm trying hard to study for my exams. Books don't seem to end.2. I'm unceasingly trying to find a job.And being out of my desired location it's tough (only god knows whats happened to Video conferencing interviews).3. I get disappointed. I'm trying hard to keep people happy. Other than my parents none understand what I'm feeling. And they too know only partially.
