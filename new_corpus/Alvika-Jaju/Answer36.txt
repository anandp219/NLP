  Different people  different location (climate)  different making of same product in different countries affect differently. Having said that I can tell you one thing.There are two types of L'oreal.L'Oral Paris and L'Oral professional.The former is lesser priced. Latter is expensive! (For me)Latter is better  much better! I love it!The former is not just normal but normal like any other shampoo! Let alone for different purposes like shine  hair fall!Dove shampoo is gentle- Yes! Not like L'Oral professional but better than any general shampoos.Go buy whatever you like... hardly matters.
