  Thanks for A2A.Of course I'll judge you! (FYI I never do that but here is an exception).You say you want a virgin wife but you're not a virgin. How convinient! And this is why indian society has chutzpahs.Just imagine this on a larger scale: if every guy wasn't a virgin but wanted a virgin wife... he'd be left unmarried because in India girl boy ratio 1991 census 933:1000 approx.So great going. Keep guys banging and find a girl from another planet.So CAN YOU SEE HOW ABSURD THAT WOULD BE!Be quiet and read on Mr.non virgin-wanting-a-Ms.virgin.1.
