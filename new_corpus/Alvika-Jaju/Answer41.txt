Seriously  what type of girl is she in today's world where girls are earning themselves and aren't dependent on the guy. So stop thinking she is financially dependent on you. If she chooses to support you morally or in anyway she can  take how much you can without hurting your self respect.5. These excuses "my future" what will "her future with me..." don't do that. If you love her- fight for her  keep her.If you don't love / value her or her love- let go of her.In that case let her be with a man who does.Believe me good man  finance may come and go  what to do in life will sometime or other get sorted out but love is seldom to rare to sometimes never found.
