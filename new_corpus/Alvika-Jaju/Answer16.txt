I'll feel honoured and be in love more! Because he is saying so so that his parents like me  the relationship between his parents and me stays good. His parents would be equally important to me. I'd love to respect their wishes and family culture.It will mean he feels me as his better half and sees his future with me: Bliss! Feeling stronger and more loved.Nobody in today's world would ask to wear only saree and hide face with the cloth till the neck. So if and when my man would suggest me some dresses I would love it.Edit:If I happen to visit villages then yes  I would follow family tradition.
