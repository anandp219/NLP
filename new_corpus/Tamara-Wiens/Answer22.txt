  Very freeing in some ways  and in other ways the same as wearing underwear. I usually only go without underwear when I'm wearing a skirt or a dress but almost never when I'm wearing panty hose. It is more convenient when getting dressed or when going to the washroom as there is no need to pull up the panties. It also feels a bit sexy and naughty when I'm getting dressed or otherwise notice it.However  I mostly don't think about it. Because women's genitals are compact without any significant dangly bits  the sensations without underwear are essentially the same for me as with them on.
