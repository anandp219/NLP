I would never encourage anyone to rush into a gender transition without being certain that what they are feeling IS gender dysphoria.From what you say  I suspect that you may "just" be gay  with what is often called a "butch" presentation  but since you have likely been raised in  and primarily exposed to  the gender binary  the disconnect between your orientation and your gender identified at birth is making you feel like you need to be a boy to be attracted to girls. This just ends up being reinforced by your disinterest in (or distaste for) feminine activities and clothing.
