  Oh  wow... this is another fractally incorrect question  which makes it almost impossible to answer.Terminology first - you have made the same mistake as Rachel Dolezal and the media made with the term "transracial". Their mistake  and yours with "transsexual " is that you have hijacked a term with a known and precise meaning  and overloaded it with an invalid  incorrect  and fundamentally insensible definition. A transsexual is an individual with gender dysphoria who transitions to their felt gender to the extent required to abate the symptoms of the dysphoria.
