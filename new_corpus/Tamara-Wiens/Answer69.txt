  Operating systems  web servers and programming languages are all non-trivial products that usually requires thousands of design and development days of effort  followed by at least as many days worth of intensive testing with large user bases. And you say that you are doing this simply as support for your startup  which I assume is the "next Facebook" that you talk about in a different question.Each of these things can be STARTED with one person - Linux  for example  started with Linus Torvalds  but he quickly got it online and into community development  when he had a kernel that could do a small subset of what the OS as a whole required.
