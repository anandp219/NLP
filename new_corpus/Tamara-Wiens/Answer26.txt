He met and has now married a friend of mine - did he change his orientation? No  but it might look like that from the outside  when you fail to account for the things that kept him in a straight relationship for so many years.In the OPs case  it's very possible that you were suppressing for the first years of your life - the most insidious part of suppression is that the one doing it may be completely unaware of it  and can blame all of the symptoms (often including anger  depression  dependency  and other self-harming behaviours) on other  nominally related  occurrences.
