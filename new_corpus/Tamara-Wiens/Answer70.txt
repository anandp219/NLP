I would suggest that you start with your social media platform  develop it with a language that will make it most easy to create  maintain and extend  deliver it with a standard web server  and make it run on the most common OSes on the market. When your startup takes off and has 10's or 100's of millions of users  and a steady stream of revenue  combined with a development team that can support and grow the platform without you  and then take on your infrastructure dreams. Or swap it around and do whatever you think will be fastest to market  cheapest to get there  and have the highest probability of generating the most income - the challenge will be that each of those will likely hit one or two of your criteria (all of which are subjective  by the way)  not really leaving you with any good option to move forward with first.As for your original question  I would start with my own server  as you are very unlikely to need the capacity afforded by a hosted environment until you have at least 10's of users  or more.
