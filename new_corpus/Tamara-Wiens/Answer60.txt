Gay people don't "transition" - they come out to themselves  and begin to live they way that their orientation requires them to live  which really only has one mandatory component - who they are romantically and sexually attracted to.Fourth  and related to my last point  being gay is NOT a "lifestyle" choice - the range of activities and behaviours and hobbies and socialization approaches and sexual attachment/expression options adopted by gay and lesbian people is as varied as it is for straight people.
