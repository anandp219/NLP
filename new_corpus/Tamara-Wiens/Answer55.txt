  All other things being equal  it is better to be a man than to be a woman. Although there are isolated roles and jobs where women receive preferential pay and promotion  these are concentrated in areas that are seen to be secondary or subservient roles (e.g. nurses vs. doctors  elementary vs. secondary school teachers). Female privilege isn't really a thing - it would be like saying black privilege or poor privilege or uneducated privilege. The challenge is that white males in particular are so embedded in their privilege that it is incredibly difficult for them to even comprehend the extent to which their privilege benefits them.
