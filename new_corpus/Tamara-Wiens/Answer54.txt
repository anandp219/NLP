Eventually  I got noticed for my writing  and ended up a Top Writer since Feb 2015.Basically  the "top" content gives new users a starting point - it's up to each user to explore from there. The more you explore  and the better (and often more unique) your content is  the more likely it is that you will be featured as part of the "top".
