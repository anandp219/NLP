I would strongly encourage you to talk to a trusted adult about what you are feeling. Hopefully this would be your parents  but the odds are against that. If you live in a relatively progressive/liberal region  you may be able to get the advice and support that you need from a teacher or guidance counsellor. If you live in a relatively large city  in just about any North American region  there is likely an LGBT support centre where they can probably provide you with some support. You can also talk to people on Quora about this - for the trans community  I would recommend Elliott Mason  Tess Norris  Katie Anne Holton or me.
