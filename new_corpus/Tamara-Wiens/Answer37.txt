  You simply can't. Your beliefs may be sincerely held  but  as in the case of flat earthers  your belief is simply wrong.You also have a significant failure to understand exactly WHAT gender transition actually is - it isn't a change of fundamental gender  it's a change of external expression to match the inner sense of gender  AT TIMES combined with changes to external sex organs. The fact that everyone  often including the trans person  mistakenly believed for some time in an incorrect gender assignment  is completely irrelevant.
