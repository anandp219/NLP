  No  not really  although that doesn't stop the torrent of questions asking for advice.The problem with advice requests is that they are very often tailored to a specific set of circumstances  which the asker believes is completely unique. The reality is that the question is usually a pretty generic problem  based on the details provided - however  most users don't want to believe that their problem isn't special and unique.This is contrary to Quora's stated aim and goals  which is to create a repository of reusable answers to various questions.
