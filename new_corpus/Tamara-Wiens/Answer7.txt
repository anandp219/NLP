My expectation is that the pre coming out/pre transition orientation of MtF women will conform relatively closely to that of the general public (i.e. the vast majority will present as heterosexual male with significantly smaller proportions presenting as bisexual and gay males). Post transition  this seems to shake out quite a bit differently  with approximately 1/3 of trans women oriented to each of men  women and both (i.e. straight  lesbian and bi). However  there is a period of settling in to orientation  and how a particular person identifies can change over time.
