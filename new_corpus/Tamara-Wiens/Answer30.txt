This is one of the most pernicious lies told by cis het people about LGBTQ. The reality is that we have as much variance in lifestyle and values as redheads or lefties or tall people - we are born this way  it's not a matter of choice or something as trivial as our religion or hobbies.That said  there is no logically valid argument for exclusion that doesn't violate the law in Canada.
