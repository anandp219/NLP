  All years can be hard  particularly if there isn't a mutual commitment to continue to work on and maintain the relationship. That said  from my own experience  there were 3 particularly hard years. The first was at the 6 year point. We had moved to England  and I was taking my master's degree. My wife was along with me and became more and more morose as the year progressed. We were on the verge at that point  until she committed to not counting on me to make her happy (her own words). It was sad for me  as I realized that I probably wasn't doing all that I could or wanted to do  and it fundamentally changed our relationship.
