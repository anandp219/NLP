  Logic in itself isn't dangerous. It's only dangerous when contaminated with fallacies and passed off as logical argument. Logic is respected because of it's objective nature- irrefutable  backed by evidence. However the domains in which people (including me) claim using logical thought are inherently subjective- few things are fact (logically true) but everything else is debatable even though opinions may tilt towards one side. In other words  fuzzy logic (probabilistic in nature) is asserted as crisp logic (deterministic) thus retaining pretext of "using logic".
