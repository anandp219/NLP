But all this was considering they came to power. In all likelihood  they won't be the ruling party. So the above analysis becomes moot. Then why wouldn't I vote for AAP? I'd if Congress was the only alternative  but it's not. Neither is BJP the only other party. In all this wrangling  we seem to forget the underdogs- "the others". SP  BSP  TDP  Left etc. Parties which I consider much worse than either BJP or Congress. And if opinion polls are to be believed BJP-led NDA would topple UPA easily with over 200 seats  but won't have as many seats as these "others".
