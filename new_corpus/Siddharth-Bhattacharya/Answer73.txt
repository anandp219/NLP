No instrumental additions to the flavor of the music. My favorite among the rock/folk genre is Simon & Garfunkel. Paul Simon wrote the songs  played the guitars while Art Garfunkel added his melodious voice resulting in a soothing end-product. The song varies in pitch: the music with intelligent variation on instruments as well as singing without resorting to shrills and shrieks (which many pop singers do). El Condor Pasa by Simon & Garfunkel is a good example of musical variations along with soothing tone:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...The Beatles were amazing when it came to variety of musical instruments.
