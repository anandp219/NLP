One of us called our parents quickly  and they stopped whatever they're doing and rushed home. It must have been a crazy drive for Dad knowing the house is on fire. Anyways it took them some time. Meanwhile I rushed to our landlords- who stayed on the ground floor (we lived on the first floor). Thankfully the father in the house ran to us  while the son went to other neighbors to gather a crowd to help while calling the fire brigade. They instructed us to stop pouring water as a short-circuit would backfire and make things worse.
