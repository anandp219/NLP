  On the face of it  Holden Caufield embodies the struggles of the youth in coping up with the society  with the norms it puts up and striving for acceptance. He questions everyday norms  ridicules people blindly subscribing to these norms and sets himself apart from them. However what makes Holden Caufield a compelling character is one needs to go deeper to analyze him as a symbol. Holden Caufield is not just a rebel- he is a failed & confused rebel. Holden realizes what he doesn't want to be  but is clueless on what he wants to be.
