What's more surprising- too many in the tourism industry can't speak English. This was one of the main reasons why I didn't interact much with the locals. Excellent public transport: The cities had one of the best public transport options I've seen anywhere in the world. By public  I mean not private. In Bangkok  there is the amazing MRT  BTS and great rail infrastructure. And of course  lots of buses. Apart from that  there are the ubiquitous tuk-tuks (like auto rickshaws just way faster). In Pattaya  I rode shared wagons with fixed rates of 10 baht roaming across the streets day and night.
