Arnab gave him ample opportunity to answer  and didn't behave the way he does. Nevertheless he was quick to pick logical fallacies and inconsistencies. Rahul denies answering so many questions including why corrupt ministers haven't been tried deeming such questions 'superficial'. I won't deny Rahul Gandhi's performance was -for lack of a better word- disappointing. Here are few possibilities explaining the interview:He isn't a good politician. Period. He involves himself with long-term goals  revolutionary ideas such as reforming the party  youth involvement but doesn't concern himself with short-term political strategies.
