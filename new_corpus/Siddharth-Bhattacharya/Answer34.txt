A small voice within us nagging "But really  is Vito right? Do I want to become like him". And these small voices within us in the end decide for us how we perceive Vito- a good person or a bad person. Vito has numerous good qualities- helping needy  ones he loves- like his godson- Jonny  he loves his sons (other than Fredo)  Tom who he has adopted. So dismissing Vito as an outright bad person would be inappropriate. He is not a bad person  but he has a compelling aura which makes the reader want to emulate him.
