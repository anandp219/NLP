But when I saw his match in reality  even though his shots have the same elegance they also are extremely powerful in a way I hadn't imagined. (for a relative speed reference  I'm comparing to the next match: Sharapova vs Liscki [2]). So there were many blinding aces. However due to hard-hitting shots  many points were won in net/out  but not by unforced errors. Pic: His great serveHe matched Groth in speed  outdid him in every other department. Needless to say  he won in straight sets. After the match  Federer spoke in fluent English to the media person  thanked all the audience and hit tennis balls-- one on every stand.
