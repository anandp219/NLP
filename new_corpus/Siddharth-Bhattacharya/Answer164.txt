There  I said it- the reason which makes people go gaga over working for them. The aura. But of course  why Google and MS have this aura? For me  the answer is because I have grown up with Google and Microsoft. While growing up  I remember Microsoft brought me exposure to computers and tons of software (Office  Media Player  Encarta  IE etc) while Google made me comfortable wading through the internet. And it didn't end there- these companies kept going crazy competing and making more awesome stuff  with better browsers  chat/ messengers  email  maps  blogger.
