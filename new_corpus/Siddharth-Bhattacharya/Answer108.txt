You constantly deploy the rhetoric of how the other guy would 'attack' if people deviate. To hold on to people's trust  you actually feign a few skirmishes. But despite these few tid-bits you've achieved what you set out for- avoiding anarchy & rather maximizing collective output. All's well  that ends well. But the ending remains. To ensure moral conduct  you needed religion. This alone was not sufficient. You needed enforcing punishments. For this you need to retain the central authority allowing you to punish.
