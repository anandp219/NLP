Religion/God are self-regulating punishments. However what definitely is not needed is mixing of politics with religion- laws based on these religious texts. Or taking legislative actions against perceived offense of any religious community. Else as long as poverty and miseries affect certain parts of the world  despite it's limitations religion is a safe-bet.
