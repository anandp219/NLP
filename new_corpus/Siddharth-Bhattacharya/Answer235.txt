We all saw the fire consuming the stuff slowly  as others tried their innovative tactics to quell the fire- sand  cloth. What did it feel like? Panic  fear  dread. A fear which transformed from seeing things you value being burnt down to realizing you may not be alive anymore. A feeling of helplessness with the realization we could do nothing alone to stop the fire from engulfing us. Continuous prayers to God (no theism debates  please). In the end after half an hour to an hour of fighting fire  the situation was brought under control with the help of our parents  neighbors and fire brigade.
