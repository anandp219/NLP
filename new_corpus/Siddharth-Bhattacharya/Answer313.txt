At this stage itself  you should be prepared. Apart from these  do read a little bit on threads/ processes/ networking/OS concepts. If you get a question on these  you can be frank and declare not knowing them in much detail. When you're confident of all this  do practice your resume. Although it's frowned upon to have a tailored answer to "tell me about yourself" it's better than not having practiced at all. Remember the question is a shorthand for "why should I hire you?". You shouldn't be telling the interviewer about your interests in football.
