The city is not a multicultural hub but 20% of the population are students at UW Madison  which makes it a very tolerant city with lots of international folks. When comparing to San Diego  definitely options will take a hit but in downtown Madison there do exist places for live music  bars  clubs while restaurants are nicely spread all over the city. As for living in the 'burbs- there are Middleton  Verona where rents are way cheaper but the more scenic part is near downtown Madison  due to the presence of Lake Mendota and Lake Monona.
