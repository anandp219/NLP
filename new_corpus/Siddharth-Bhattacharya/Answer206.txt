When he was done  I was lucky enough to be granted one of the three questions. I asked some lame stuff on Occupy Wall Street movement and given his past association with it  he praised it's goal. When all was done and room was evacuating  I realized this is my opportunity. I wasn't to let go so easily. So I started speaking to him. To sound wise-ass I'd read on his theories on Information asymmetry  and gobbled everything I could on Keynesian economics from my multiple economics classes. However the questions I asked him were more or less what an annoying 21-year old asks on meeting a celebrity: "how I get there?"
