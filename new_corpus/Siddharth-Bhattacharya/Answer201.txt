In the Indian context (where it's highly acceptable for parents to be paying children's fees till end of college) the increased pressure on the family to compensate for the child may mean contrarily child having to compromise on the quality of education. Moreover with societal pressures & prejudices in India  many parents won't rather spend towards their children's higher education. Therefore governments tend to have a strong subsidy net towards higher education so as to churn more productive individuals irrespective of cost constraints subject to merit (that's why entrance exams).
