Mechanical nature of the killings and scale: The killers were neither barbarians on the street  nor was it only the national military. Extermination of Jews was part of government policy. Sophisticated machinery - including gas chambers - was especially developed for the purpose. The process involved the government and citizens of the nation alike. Moreover it was conducted in an extremely mechanical way - unlike soldiers charged to kill their opponents. It wasn't a battle to be won  it was just work to be done.
