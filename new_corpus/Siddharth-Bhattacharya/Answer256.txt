Overall the shared adulation for the great man made being a part of the audience a great experience. His victory was an icing on the cake.Pic: Me (I know I should've got a haircut) with RF in the background[1] I was for an interview in NYC  and figured last moment I'd get another day in NYC so booked resale tickets for next day without realizing I would be able to see Federer & Sharapova. Luck! [2] If you find a similar question on Sharapova feel free to send the question my way. Being a part of her audience has it's own quirks.
