The world is often unkind to new talent  new creations. The new needs friends. Last night  I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past  I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto  "Anyone can cook." But I realize  only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist can come from anywhere.
