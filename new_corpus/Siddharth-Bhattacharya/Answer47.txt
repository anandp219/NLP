In essence  the cost of providing healthcare services is higher due to sophistication required. We need doctors to provide healthcare services who need to go through rigorous training for years to achieve skills to perform surgeries and examine patients  thus making them in higher demand in competitive marketplace increasing their costs. So while as a moral society we need to ensure no one is denied the basic needs due to lack of money including healthcare  we also need to ensure no one is forced to provide services (by law) for a lesser amount than their skills would allow according to the competitive free-market.
