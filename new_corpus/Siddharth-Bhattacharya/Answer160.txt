Currently it's the home of financial crises. It would be so much better to hear the experiences of Europeans on all these issues than having others write on these topics from our few travel experiences there/ reading. An exclusive focus on expanding in Europe would make Quora much more awesome. Since the population of Europe is anyways much lesser  it would be better to restrict new users from other spheres to give their voice a bigger say. When it has been done  Quora can have it's next public release.
