All is well  except if we bring them into power so early without having established themselves as a homogenous party rather than heterogenous individual units  it will eventually collapse from within or be destabilized easily by opponents. In it's brief cameo in Delhi  the party felt the pressure as Vinod Kumar Binny resigned  alongside the independent MLA. In a platform as large as the centre where there is too much power at offer  the dissent from within can easily multiply. And at the end of the day  we'll be left with a weak government  crippled by Congress again.
