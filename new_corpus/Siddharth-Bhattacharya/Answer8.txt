  Do ask yourself one question before starting journey of a quizzer: Why do you want to start competitive quizzing? Life at college (especially IITs) is hectic. There is lots to do: courses  assignments  projects. Why would you to make it worse by pursuing something demanding extensive reading  surfing and all that? Unlike projects  quizzing even gives no marks. Neither is there much money to be made and fame- forget it! If you're still listening despite this  you must be a curious soul. Quizzing needs curious souls and if you have it: then  becoming a good quizzer is trivial.
