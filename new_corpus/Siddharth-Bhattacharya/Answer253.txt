The guy two seats ahead of me caught one ball  and I missed it by a whisker. Sigh!Pic: RF hitting balls to each stand  after winningAudienceEven though seeing the great is in itself a reward  an integral part of live experience is being part of a much larger crowd. So I'll relive part of the experience. The match was supposed to start 7 PM EST  but due to previous ongoing match between Berdych and someone  it kept on delaying. It was clear no one cared  but once they showed Fed the first time on big screen outside  everyone started cheering Berdych to finish quickly.
