For the insane actors who have been thoroughly convinced of the "injustice of the West"  "revenge" the act to jihad seems like a natural call. The Islamic world attempts to condemn them  but nevertheless are also hurt at the further loss of Muslim identity and marginalization thus cocooning into a protective state unaltered by progressive ideas from the rest and becoming radicalized further. What this means in modern times? Does it mean they're justified in killings? Of course not. Does it mean the "average Muslim" is supporting them or identifies with them?
