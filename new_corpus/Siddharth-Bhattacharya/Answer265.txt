  This Indian is very  very glad about the award for the following reasons: 1) A fellow Indian wins a Nobel prize. Yay!2) India as land of peace: India has been marketing itself as peaceful nation  largely due to Gandhi's peaceful movement. However Gandhi didn't win the prize. No prize was awarded in 1948 citing "there was no suitable living candidate" and the committee said this officially:The greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize.
