I work in a company founded and run by a woman (Judy Faulkner) and I can't help but notice her rational approach when she speaks. I chose a female professor as supervisor for my Math thesis for she was one of the better faculty members in our department. One of my favorite professors Angelie Multani is a female. I've encountered many rational females to believe in equal capability although if someone argues society has conditioned them to adopt more emotionally-sensitive roles  I wouldn't disagree.
