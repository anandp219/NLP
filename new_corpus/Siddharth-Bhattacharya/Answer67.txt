Don't try to classify it some genre. It's fine as a drama with all the family emotions. It's a good sci-fi until it all stops making sense. I'd personally classify it as fantasy. The movie is similar to Harry Potter with central ideas like "love beats all"  "saving humanity for greater good"  some time-turner nonsense cloaked with some scientific sugar-coating of higher dimensions. Enjoy it just like you enjoyed Harry Potter.And most importantly  try forgetting Christopher Nolan has anything to do with the movie.
