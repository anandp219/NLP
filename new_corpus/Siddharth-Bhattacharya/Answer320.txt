If someone from the family doesn't go out of their way to make enemies (Indira)  they remain default choice for the helm. This leaves determining the next most powerful position. There is no "official" second-most powerful position  but when PM's position was vacated by the family (Sonia stepped down as she didn't enjoy the same support as the family brand due to Italy connection) it suddenly mattered. The decision had the potential of opening the Pandora's Box as entire top-brass would've battled for the helm.
