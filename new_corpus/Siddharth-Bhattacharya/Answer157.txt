At our age  we hear a lot of opinions and are very vociferous about our own. Not all these opinions are well-researched and most times a reflection of what the media publishes. (very biased)Answers praising India in non-India related topics can turn on the upvoting instincts of our patriotic side and due to the huge numbers  distribute it to the feeds of users from other corners of the world.Some of us "kids" post a lot of memes  add irrelevant topics to questions  write funny 1-liners in serious questions and so on.
