It requires endurance for a mediocre movie. The maximum science you need to know is (in Joshua Engel's words from his great review) "some college-dorm-level pseudo-philosophy about how love transcends space and time" said by Anne Hathaway. Which reminds me: if you're one of those who like enduring shit movies due to the beautiful actresses (I've done that before)  Anne got a boy-cut so she doesn't look the same as her prior movies. You might still like her  but there are odds you won't (pic pasted so you know beforehand).
