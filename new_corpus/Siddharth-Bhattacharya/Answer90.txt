It keeps writers like me motivated to continue writing and costs nothing to the user. Why I value upvotes so much? As said- I am admittedly a narcissist (I believe many are  but don't admit) who writes not just for the satisfaction of it but for the accompanying rewards as well. I've shifted from blogs to Quora for the readers. I'm not content writing without being read. I'm content only by knowing my answers have been read & appreciated. Upvotes is a signal of the appreciation. Moreover an upvote represents the standing of the answer on the question-page.
