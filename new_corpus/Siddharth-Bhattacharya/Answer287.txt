  I backpacked for a week in Thailand 2 months back  and though that hardly qualifies me I would still try. I visited Bangkok  Pattaya and Ko Pha Ngan. I found Thailand to be among the best countries I've visited. Some surprising things from the nation  which I wasn't expecting:Good infrastructure: As a developing nation  I was expecting the infrastructure to resemble Indian cities. But Bangkok's infrastructure really feels closer to London or NYC's than Delhi's. Even though that maybe an exaggeration  the infrastructure doesn't make it obvious being in a third-world country.
