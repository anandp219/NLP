So even if we might think a football game adds less social value than growing rice  if a consumer is willing to pay more for the former  the market declares it more valuable. Whichever individual possesses the necessary skills to design  manufacture and market these tools will reap more monetary rewards. Another important factor is the exclusivity of the skill. So let's say we all agree it's important to have dirt cleaned off our streets. Does this mean the janitor will be paid more? Mostly no  because cleaning streets doesn't require expertise in a field and years worth of training.
