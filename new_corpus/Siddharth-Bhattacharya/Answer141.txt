Turns out if I need to do anything apart from this  MS Office mostly has the answer (because I don't do any fancy stuff*). I don't play with RAM/disks  nor understand the specs and very high performance doesn't make a big difference to me for the tasks I do. They run fine enough to get things done. I suspect this is somewhat representative of the typical user from middle of the bell-curve. The only instance personally where I was convinced Windows wasn't fit for the task was when I started using my machine for programming.
