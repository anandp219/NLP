  Chetan Bhagat's success is not an exception  it's almost a part of the rule. We ask as if he's a rare person whose horrible work by standards of the art-form he practices has elevated him to success. Let's turn our heads elsewhere for a moment- Bollywood. The two most commercially successful actors are Akshay Kumar & Salman Khan. I can spend an entire lifetime trying to decipher some meaning in their movies  but won't be able to. Yet they are idolized 'stars'. Music? The infamous Honey Singh- after rape protests- who used to be darling of so many.
