While other companies have to hard-sell to me what innovations they're making  Google/MS needed no introduction. I knew they're making impact (being a witness to their impact myself)  and needed no stats to verify this. And as I said  being founded by hardcore tech guys rather than "sales/design guys wanting a tech co-founder"  they enjoy a positive reputation among tech-geeks  who dislike management interference. For American kids  I guess Microsoft was old-school by early 2000's itself and they've grown with Facebook dominating their social lives.
