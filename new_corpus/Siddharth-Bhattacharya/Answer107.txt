What do you tell them? Drumroll! For masterstrokes don't end so easily: You compromise! With another intelligent person who understands all this & tell him to 'invent an ideology' to distribute subjects between yourselves thus creating a 'sense of threat' by citing each other's name. So you both battle it out on a public platform in a heated manner  convincing half of them to move either way. On the positive side you've lesser people to manage  on the negative side you've lesser manpower. But the best part is- all people in your 'nation' work in similar direction.
