Also maintaining a LinkedIn profile is good for this purpose.InterviewsExcept for on-campus application  you'll be subjected to phone interviews. There will be more of these if you're in India than in US already. The questions (and format) will almost resemble the later interviews. After 2 or more rounds  if they find your knowledge of CS concepts to be good enough they'll fly you to their onsite (although I've heard at times conducting interview in India offices). Here typically in a day there will be 4-5 interviews of 45 minutes each.
