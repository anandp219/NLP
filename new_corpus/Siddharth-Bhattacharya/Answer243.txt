The reasons leading up to Hitler's rise make up for an interesting case study - loss in WW1  Treaty of Versailles  hyperinflation  Great Depression - on reasons which led citizens to justify killings  but in the end they were just immediate causes and none of it would've been possible for the Nazis without the prevalent antisemitism and rampant use of nationalist imagery. All these tragedies in human history are a reflection of dark recesses in ourselves. When do we let our morality submit to fear  hatred and other primal instincts?
