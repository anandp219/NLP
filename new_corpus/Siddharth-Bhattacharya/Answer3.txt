However they exist in big numbers making themselves heard  but they may or may not be intelligent. Coming to the question of what intelligent men think? I have dealt with many intelligent people of both genders and been amazed by the analysis girls can put through on topics. Most intelligent people- of both genders- agree there are differences in how men and women behave  but it's not an inherent condition but rather there goes centuries of societal conditioning. It has lesser to do with brain differences and more with what their parents and other members of society told them to do while growing up.
