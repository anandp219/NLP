And finally maybe some day these answers yield tangible benefits- upvotes increase my visibility to a larger audience. Why do I ask for upvotes explicitly? Many new users aren't acquainted with upvoting mechanisms. Reiterating requests for upvotes can often get them to upvote just like multiple mentions by companies advertising their product does cause buying. Conclusion: I'm a mere mortal who loves appreciation. If you like my answers  I'd again request you to upvote them. If not  no need to follow me.
