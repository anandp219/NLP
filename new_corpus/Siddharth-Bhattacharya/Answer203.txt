Scientific research with it's equipment & stuff needs huge investments and that's an area where private players don't specifically show interest until direct benefits are reaped. As a result governments become major investors towards funding research. This is payed using taxpayer's subsidy money. Along with equipment  of course there's the task of paying the researchers. A small portion of this net amount goes towards subsidizing student's education fees. ConclusionGovernments invest considerable sums of taxpayers' money towards higher education institutes- irrespective of student's (parent's) financial status.
