Then there were the ferries for traveling within Bangkok. Inter-city transportation was also amazing. Frequent buses  cheap flights within nation operated by AirAsia  NukAir  Thai Airways. And I also took the over-night train to reach Surat Thani  from where I took a ferry/ship to Koh Phangan. The train was as marvelous as it can get in quality. Excellent partying scene  live music: Although I'd heard lots about it  I was still surprised by the awesomeness of it. The street off Khaosan Road in Bangkok has amazing live music till 1 am on the streets.
