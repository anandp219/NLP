Drink sitting on it. Everything. What's more? It's literally a humongous hippy party. People from all over the country assemble there  about 30 000- 50 000 in the whole expanse of the grounds of the Stonehenge  and there is dance  music  booze and even pagan worship. This is a picture from an instance when a girl in the crowds started belly-dancing in the middle of the stones.As I said  it has some pagan roots and is essentially a religious cult. Everyone stays awake till the dawn  for the first signs of sun which is considered holy or something.
