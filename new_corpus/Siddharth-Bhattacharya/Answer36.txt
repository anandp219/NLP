  Rapes/sexual assaults are not necessarily increasing in India.When I came across the question  I saw answers blaming patriarchy  misogyny  objectification  wretched state of women in India as reasons. But these are causes of rape  not why they are increasing. Unless the society is following a trajectory as shown below (or another increasing function) these answers are wrong. However what maybe the truth is we are seeing cases of rapes more often in the news. I will therefore offer a perspective explaining this: Reporting rates have probably increased Media has finally decided to highlight issues such as rapes as headlines Society is shifting towards acknowledging rape as a pressing issue.
