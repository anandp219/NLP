  Sorry. In my process of answering  I'll be intentionally violating one of Quora's unsaid norms- 'not mentioning the same name as another answerer'. The purpose of me adding the same answer is not being satisfied with the explanation provided of why one would recommend it so I'd add the same name though elaborate differently than existing answer. My choice is Death Note.So what's so splendid about it and why would I recommend only this? At superficial level  Death Note is a mad-rush between two extremely intelligent lads L & Yagami Light outclassing each other by wits.
