Same with Walking Street  Pattaya (although that's not it's claim to fame) There is lots of partying going on the streets late into the night. Granted most of it is by the Western tourists  but still the energy on the streets is very welcoming and cheers the moods up. These are of course apart from the different moon parties in Koh Phangan  most famously Full Moon Party. Overall for street partying  I can't imagine a better place than Thailand. Even NYC doesn't match up remotely closely  forget the rest of US (except 6th Street  Austin).
