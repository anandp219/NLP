Bombarded by choices  often readers can't engage in deep analysis of every text they tackle. As a result  lots of texts with a deeper meaning -and often powerful commentary on society- get discarded over other texts which are more appealing on the surface. To avoid loss of certain powerful texts into oblivion  critics dedicate their careers into analyzing hidden-layers of meaning behind the obvious. When texts have passed this test of criticism  they're rated by the critics for their quality. Those which perform fairly well in these ratings become recognized and critically acclaimed.
