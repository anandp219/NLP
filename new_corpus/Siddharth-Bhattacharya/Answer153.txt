"Saare Jahan Se Accha" was written by Muhammad Iqbal. He was a great poet  was knighted just like Tagore but didn't die without his share of controversies. He was among the founding fathers of Pakistan movement- the call for separate nation. Every possible alternative has notorious connotations if we want to find one. Jana Gana Mana was the least controversial one at the time and chosen to immortalize our first nobel laureate Rabindranath  who in his patriotism turned down his knighthood. Any widely recognized symbol is bound to be marred by controversies.Conclusion about Jan Gan Man: There's no need to change it.
