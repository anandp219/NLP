  I currently work for Microsoft in Redmond. In the on-campus placements  I got placed at Epic Systems in Wisconsin (USA) and transitioned recently to MS. I have also interviewed onsite with Google  Facebook  Amazon and Yelp at their head-offices (and know many friends who work there). I can provide you an overview to the various questions you've asked-- about the package itself  short-listing criterion  interview process  interview preparation and a little bit on non-CS related careers which are equally lucrative.
