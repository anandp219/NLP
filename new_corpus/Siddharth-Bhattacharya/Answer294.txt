Pic: Live music near Khao San Road  BangkokOverall sense of lawlessness: This didn't surprise me at all as I expected it but it was mild surprise after realizing the great infrastructure  public facilities. Some examples are vehicle-driving (though nowhere as crazy as India) was way wackier than West. In Koh Phangan  before handing me the motorkbike for rent I wasn't asked at all for driving license although the guy kept my passport. Even in Goa  they ask for licenses. Of course  this lawlessness is apart from the street hawkers  hookers and everything related to prostitution which goes on.7-Eleven's: There are so many of them in every nook and corner of the country (I went to) that when asked for directions  they serve as landmarks.
