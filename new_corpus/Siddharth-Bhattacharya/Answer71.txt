  Good question  as lots of such trends are a mere result of Bandwagon effect. I will therefore try to provide my own reasons for preferring one type of music (rock) over the other (pop). My expertise on Bieber is low: haven't listened to many of his songs. However when I heard 'Baby' the first time I mistook it for a female's voice before a friend corrected me. That in itself isn't a good enough reason to denounce him  but the music was awful as well and it was unsettling knowing this was a mega-hit.
