Go grab a drink  a meal with a stranger  walk around the city with them with the added bonus of not having to be self-conscious and without peer pressure. The politeness of some strangers while traveling who've often gone out of their way to help has impressed me  and knowing locals is a good way to challenge one's preconceived notions about the world. Pros: As I said  there would be no friends to "distract". All your attention would be on outside things. You'd in a real sense exploring the place.
