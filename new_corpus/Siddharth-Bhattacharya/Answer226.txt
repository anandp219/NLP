For me  Stonehenge belonged to the former category. Especially given there was a restriction on entering. The fact that we had come all the way  and it's history as a wallpaper in Windows machines essentially convinced us to pay the extra bucks to see what we could see from a distance. Summer SolsticeIf I hadn't been here  I'd have been most likely very pleased with my experience as a tourist. However going on the summer solstice is altogether a different marvel. On this day they remove all the ropes  so not just you can come close to the stones  but sit on it  dance on it.
