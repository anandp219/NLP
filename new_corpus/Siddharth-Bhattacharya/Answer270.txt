Even though Malala is controversial in the same vein as Liu Xiabao  Kailash's apolitical/ non controversial nature is a much needed respite to the degradation and controversies faced by the prize.My only qualmKailash Satyarthi doesn't seem to have done his graduation from IITs  and thus questions like these still have no counter-examples: Why isn't there a single Nobel laureate on IIT's mantlepiece? or Why IITians are not getting any Nobel prizes? Sigh! [1] The Nobel Peace Prize 1989
