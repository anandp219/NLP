Inventing those 'ideologies' for creating more nations required fomenting divisions. It started with tapping natural differences such as color/race  gender and moved on to artificial ones like castes.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now enter reality: Religious head though powerful has always been less powerful than the state which controlled economic means as well as legislation. It was always more acceptable to let go of the concepts of religion & other things since they're making it easier for the nation rhetoric (overuse of the same 'nation' rhetoric will turn off people).
