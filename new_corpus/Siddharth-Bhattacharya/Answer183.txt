This leads to an irrational behavior where employers would tend to sidestep good employees with skillsets based on these prejudices. Sometimes it's part of a legal framework  other times it's not. Nevertheless the result is created inequality which isn't a direct result of market forces. As another example on a macro-scale  consider one country bombarding/ colonizing another country. The resultant lack of resources among the affected populace creates income inequality within that country  and an inequality between countries.
