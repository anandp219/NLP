"Have I explicitly asked for it in answers? Yes  in this answer:So you have got one part right: I do frequently "ask for upvotes". Do I always ask for upvotes? This is my last answer (before this) and here I haven't asked. Therefore we have a counter-example and hence the claim is falsified. Do I beg for upvotes? Notice the use of conditionals like "if" in my requests: "If you feel like exploring my further answers" "Want to extend your courtesy further? ""Please extend your courtesy and upvote if you like" This seems like a humble form of begging.
