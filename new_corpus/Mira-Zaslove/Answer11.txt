They were the ones who made mistakes  learned from them  and adjusted. A member of my team and good friend is now making great money  loving his work and his life  when just 16 months ago his fingernails were falling out due to stress. He had a few temporary setbacks  but always kept pushing forward  and never saw himself as a failure. He didn't quit when the going got tough  or try to avoid his problems. He was mature  acted like an adult  and faced issues head on  and was able to achieve what very few people believed he could.
