To get a similar response  the couple would need to be practically having sex on the table  or the man would have to be twice the woman's age  etc. Most of my friends in the US dated in school  and again teachers pretty much stayed out of it. In India  I've been told  teachers often would call a girl's parents to tattle if they found that she was dating a guy within her school.Also  the girl's family in India is likely to keep check on the girl and her purity -- at any age. In the US  once a girl turns 18  and is out of the house  they are generally out of their parents control.
