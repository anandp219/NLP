The Democratic nomination is hers. Joe Biden recently announced that it was too late for him to get in  likely because he knew that he had little chance of securing the nomination. Biden is very well liked by the President  the beltway  and the populace  but Clinton is just too far ahead. House Clinton has secured the funding  talent  and support. Biden  and his advisors  knew the fight would be ugly  bruising  and he wouldn't win it. Biden  like House Tully has the motto of Family  Duty  Honor and family came first.
