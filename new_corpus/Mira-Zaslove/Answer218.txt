Take a chance and do something bold and unexpected. Focus on your skills  not on perceived discrimination. Your engineering capabilities have nothing to do with your skin color. Good companies and top managers just want the job done  and will give it to the best candidate. It never hurts to be the best-- work to be better than your American and Indian peers. I currently work in an engineering group at a large Silicon Valley tech company. The Director  VP  and CTO of my group are all Indians. There are more Indians -- all mostly software engineers -- than Americans on my floor.
