It was uncomfortable  but worth it. Because your bones are flexible after giving birth  wrapping helps to push everything back into place. Belly Wraps should be worn for 4-6 weeks after delivery to reap maximum benefits.Looking at my belly now  it's still a little flabbier than it was before giving birth. Not sure I'll ever lose the extra skin  but I fit into my pre-pregancy clothes. It's hard to believe that less than 2 years ago  my belly was so big that I could barely squeeze into restaurant booths.
