)You are learning bad habitsFor many people  not learning anything can be a red flag. However  at a promising start-up you believe in  I would say give it time. One minute you can be answering the phones  and then next day you can be leading sales meetings. Once you are on that rocket-ship  dont get off. One advantage of working at start-ups vs established companies is that you get to wear a lot of hats  and learn a lot of different skill sets.A red-flag is when you are learning bad habits. This largely is a function of the first 3 items  but if you have a bad product  bad management  or the top people are leaving  you may start learning bad habits.
