So  if someone keeps showing up in your dreams  take a look at where you are in the current phase of your life  and take a look at what this person signifies to you. Do they always make you feel a certain way? What was going on in your life when you first met them? Is there a time you always see this person? The person you keep seeing in your dream could be a signal. Is there something in your life that they signify? If so  interpret the dream and act.
