  I've managed teams of talented  smart  and hardworking people as they grew into adulthood. Following are a some truths that many find uncomfortable. Mistakes and failure are a good thingWe all hate to make mistakes and it sucks to fail. However  experience is the best way to learn  and we learn more from our mistakes than our successes. Transitioning into adulthood means making the most of experiences. And mistakes and failure are less dangerous than complacency and playing it safe. The most successful members of my team were not the ones who never made a mistake.
