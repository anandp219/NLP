Don't assume that your interviewer has read your resume. However  don't simply recite your resume verbatim to your interviewer. Sadly many interviewers are not that well prepared  and don't let that sidetrack you. Also  keep in mind who is interviewing you. If it's an introductory HR interview  keep things high-level. Even if you are interviewing for a highly technical job  chances are the recruiter will leave that part of the interviewing process to the subject matter expert. If you are having trouble with this question  re-frame it to: "Why are you are a great fit for this position?"
