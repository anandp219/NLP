Hans Albert's IQ is unknown  but was likely reasonably high. In 1988  the American Society of Civil Engineers created the Hans Albert Einstein Award to recognize achievement in erosion control  sedimentation  and waterway development. Yet  the study of hydraulics  and the younger Einstien's research on river sediment and tidal flows did not capture the word's attention and rapture the way the theory of general relativity and physics did. Albert Einstein wrote in Letters to friends that  Eduard: "The more refined of my sons  the one I considered really of my own nature  was seized by an incurable mental illness."
