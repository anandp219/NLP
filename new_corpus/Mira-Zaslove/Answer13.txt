I saw people growing into adults as they began to understand that most things in life are not personal. People are pretty self-centered and that is ok. Understanding this makes understanding others a lot easier. Similarly  I saw people maturing when they stopped worrying about what other people were doing or thinking. Transitioning into adulthood  often means taking responsibility for your own actions and doing things for yourself and not for others. It also means not expecting too much of others.
