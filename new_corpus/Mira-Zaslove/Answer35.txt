Studies have indicated that Musicians Are Probably Smarter Than The Rest Of Us and some research concludes that musicians tend to have higher IQ scores than their non-musician counterparts. I am not a physicist. But I am married to one  and have picked up some lingo. I can muddle through an answer to What is a sub-gravitational force? I have also met a few Nobel Prize winning physicists and they are different from you and me. But they are also different from each other. It is not simply a matter of having a certain IQ level.
