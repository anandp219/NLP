Rick does what needs to be done to survive. Not only has Rick survived  but he has also kept his son  and his daughter alive. He is a single father  taking care of a baby and a teenage son -- which makes him a pretty big ass-kicker by itself. Not to mention  fighting off hoards of walkers  wolves  and deprived humans who want to kill him  and his group  at every step. Anyone who has tried to take care of a baby in the best of circumstances  knows how loud  hungry  and utterly dependent they are.
