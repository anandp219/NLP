For instance  when I was interviewing people for a highly competitive Sales and Trading job  we were looking for candidates who were highly money motivated. When I asked a candidate his goal in life  he responded  I want to sit in a hot tub full of money. Lots and lots of bubbles  and more money. For this particular job  this answer was ok. I imagine it would be a turn off to a non-profit.2. Research the PeopleGo to LinkedIn  Facebook and Google to research all the people you will be interviewing with  and the CEO and high level execs.
