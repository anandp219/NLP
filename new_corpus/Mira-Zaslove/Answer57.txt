  Who won the debate? Depends who you ask. The winner is either Clinton or Sanders. Like the election itself  O'Malley  Web  and Chafee are not in the running. Unlike the Republican Primary race  the Democratic Primary race is clearly between 2 people. I watched the debate  and thought both Clinton and Sanders performed well  and further solidified their base. As the graphic below shows  reviews on who won are mixed. But interestingly  they are mixed in a pretty similar way: Editors largely believed Clinton was the clear and decisive winner  whereas viewer polls on these same sites  largely believed Sanders won by a significant margin.
