Similarly  a dating website is only as good as the potential dates on the site. People will start using the service  only after a tremendous amount of work has been done on the backend making the service scalable and launch ready. Again  inventory is king. Fancy marketing  slick websites  or any of that jazz doesn't really mean much. They won't get people to start using a service. Execution is everything in a marketplace. Just look at craigslist. People started using it because it works. For people to start using the service not only does it need to work  but it needs to be easy to sign up and fast to provide value.
