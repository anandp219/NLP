  Going to a top college can open some doors  but it won't keep them open. Similarly  not going to a top college can close some doors  but it won't keep them closed.It's been nearly 2 decades since I applied to colleges  and I can still remember and identify with your angst. AP courses  SAT prep  essay editing  and college applications are immensely stressful and all consuming. I vividly remember filling out those applications  and how much work went into it. The stress you are feeling is understandable.
