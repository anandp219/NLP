Many people believe Vladimir Putins Net Worth In 2015 is Higher Than Bill Gates? Putins salary is nine million rubles  or $145 000  per year  but Putin doesn't seem to even care.Frankly  I dont even know my own salary  they just give it to me  and I put it away in my account. Putin does not even show up on the Forbes List. When asked about his net worth  Forbes told newsweek: Vladimir Putin is not on the list because we have not been able to verify his ownership of assets worth $1 billion or more.Quantifying the wealth of dictators and royals is difficult.
