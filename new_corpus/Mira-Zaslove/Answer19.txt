The Presidents before and after Abraham Lincoln are also both considered monumental failures by liberals and conservatives. They were the wrong men  at the wrong time and were unable to rise to the Presidential occasion.James Buchanan did nothing to save the Union and his pathetic response to secession and the crisis preceding the Civil War are "deemed the greatest single failure of any American President" by many historians  including Kenneth C. Davis. Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House of Representatives  and Reconstruction was held back under his leadership.
