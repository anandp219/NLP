I was annoyed. He wasn't hitting his sales targets and was instead spending time giving me ideas on how to do my job. I was resistant and wasted a lot of time and energy wanting him to just "be quiet and do his job." He wasn't the best salesperson but he had the best ideas on how to improve the team's overall strategy. He hated cold calling  and being on the phone  a necessary skill for a salesperson  but not a sales manager. I quickly realized that my numbers would improve if we worked together.
