While Lincoln was defeated in this Senate race by the incumbent Stephen A. Douglas  he later went on to become President. Lincoln led the country through the Civil War  and kept the Union together. Lincoln's radical words helped to solidify him as a statesman and man able to keep the country together: A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure  permanently  half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved  I do not expect the house to fall  but I do expect it will cease to be divided.
