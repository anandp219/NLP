In the US  there is actually more of a culture of "gold diggers " and it is more culturally acceptable for women to expect the men to pay for everything.One of the largest differences that could provide major culture shock is that couples in the US have a lot more independence choosing their relationships and marriages. The families  for the most part  stay out of it. Most US Parents want their children to marry  and want grandchildren  but it isn't culturally acceptable to butt in. A Parent rushing their kid to marry will likely backfire and have the opposite effect.
