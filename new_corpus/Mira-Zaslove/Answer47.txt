  Most of the characters on the Walking Dead (TWD) are badasses to have survived this long. Sure there are some non-badasses  like Father Gabriel  but our group is solid. Carol  Michonne  and Daryl are major badasses. And so are Maggie and Glen. In the midst of the apocalypse  I would trust any one of them with my life. But the biggest badass on TWD has got to be our main man  Rick Grimes. (Source: The Walking Dead  Rick Grimes)Rick is the leader  and ultimate badass among badasses. He is alert  loyal  and brutal.
