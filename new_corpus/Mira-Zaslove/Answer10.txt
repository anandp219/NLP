They were the people who pushed themselves  had the courage to try new things and were comfortable falling  and getting back up. Something that surprised me as a hiring manager  and surprises me still: people who made the most money  were not the ones who were the smartest  the most talented  or even most valuable -- they were the ones who asked for the most. Sure  by asking for a lot  they were often told no. But  eventually someone said yes. Similarly  the people who have been the most successful five years out  were not always perfect.
