After you've told the audience what they need to know  give them a clear call to action. Be positive and proactive. Don't assume that your audience is automatically going to know what to do with what you told them. And don't just hope that they will remember to do it later. Be prepared to get what you want. Make the call to action easy  immediate  and seamless.Finally  if the presentation is 10 minutes.
