It could be culture shock for a middle aged Indian to walk into a standard male bachelor party in the US. Not just the family  but the broader community in India  pays more attention to romantic relationships  specifically regarding women. For example  if a neighbor in India saw a young girl and boy alone at a restaurant  there is a chance that they would call or visit the girl's family to alert them. And the girl could get into trouble. In the US  nobody really cares. The broader community generally stays out of who dates who.
