  I've spent the majority of my career negotiating  and training and managing negotiators. I've been involved with thousands of small  medium  and large negotiations.I've seen a few different types of people be effective. Some are the brash  loud and obnoxious types -- like Donald Trump. Yet  others are the opposite and totally quiet  shy  and respectful. Yet  all top negotiators share a few important characteristics. They are able to: Focus on the outcome Ask the right questionsListen and understand motivationExecute and appear confident and credible Handle failure and riskBe resilient and not give upA lot of people dislike negotiation because they view it as adversarial.
