  Ahhh  the chicken and the egg. How do two-sided marketplaces get people to start using their services? They require both buyers and sellers. And to get people to really start using their service  they need to start with one first: the sellers.A marketplace will succeed only if it has inventory. Buyers and sellers are required on both sides to monetize  but the side that is needed first is the side that provides the goods. For example  all the buyers in the world aren't meaningful if there isn't anything to sell.
