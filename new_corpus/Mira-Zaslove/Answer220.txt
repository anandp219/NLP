I've never once heard anyone directly say an Indian  or anyone of any race  was a bad hire because of their skin color. Now of course  there will always be some people who are ignorant. You may occasionally hear these rude comments  but I don't believe they are the norm  and I wouldn't focus on them. Certainly women  and other minorities vying for engineering jobs will hear similarly crappy comments. Yet  of all groups in software engineering  I think discrimination against Indian engineers is probably the least common  especially in tech and in Silicon Valley.Now for the harder part that actually may impact your job prospects: navigating the immigration process.
