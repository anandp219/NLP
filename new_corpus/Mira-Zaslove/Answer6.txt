FDR came into the White House  and immediately took action to turn the country around. FDR's "First 100 Days" and New Deal  brought tremendous change and helped the country to move forward. His memorable one-liner gave the country the confidence to take bold steps  and brought Americas out of their state of fear and into one of action and progress. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident  that all men are created equal."
