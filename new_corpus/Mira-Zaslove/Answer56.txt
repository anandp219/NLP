6. How realistic are the deadlines?Ask how often deadlines are met  and what happens if deadlines slip. If the interviewer says that deadlines are always ambitious  then ask how the deadlines get met. Are trade-offs made with the product  or do people work double time? Ask for a few examples and just listen. Ask the interviewer what suggestions they have for improving the process. See if the interview has good ideas and if they are optimistic that things will improve. It could be a red flag if they say that things will never change-- or if they say the pressure will only get worse as the company grows and expands.
