Marco Rubio  from the House Tyrell is  "Growing Strong" and has a real shot of securing the Republican nomination. He strikes a pragmatic balance  and like House Tyrell  is politically savvy in a strategic and understated way. By taking the slow and steady course  and raising under the radar  he very well may be the next to face  and fall  to House Clinton in 2016.
