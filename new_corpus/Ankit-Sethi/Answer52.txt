  Cult is not a genre any more than box-office flops are a genre.Cult as a concept is circumscribed by the following ideas:Commercial earnings: a financially successful movie is disqualified from being a cult hit by definition. The number of average filmgoers unaware of the movie counts towards its bonafides.Aesthetic considerations: something judged to be too ahead of its time or too odd to pigeonhole helps make it a cult filmPersona: if a director or actor maintains a select but ardent following through a unique public image and personal vision  middling films of theirs can be reevaluated as cult filmsRetroactive nominations: throwaway fare from a bygone era and often possessing a sensibility naive by contemporary standards is sometimes "rediscovered" for its ironic pleasures and deemed to be a cult object.Foreign films that receive a modest screening in a home country by some fortunate accident; mediocre domestic films that are syndicated on national television and catch on -- all stand a chance of becoming cult films.Quentin Tarantino has watched a wide array of films and his knowledge of various film traditions is superlative.
