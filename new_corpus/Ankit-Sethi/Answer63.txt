The problem being that the audience for this video would include women and men who broadly agree with its message but would take offense at the tone  as if the humdrum things being talked about  like when to have a baby or when one should come home at night is so out of the realm of possibility for a couple to achieve mature understanding upon  that it becomes a point of defiance and Amazonian courage. It talks down to the men and women it is primarily speaking to  with some bamboozling poetic fancies in the mix  and so alienates people who would broadly agree with what it is trying to champion.
