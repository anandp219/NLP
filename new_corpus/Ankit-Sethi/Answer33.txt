Visits to an oasis provide temporary respite but the hostility of the insects and assorted critters waiting for them to stop moving is constant. They meet an aboriginal boy who takes them on an adventure through his home terrain. A makeshift family of three forms with a budding romance between the girl and the aboriginal adolescent. It is not to last however  but there is much beauty and loss before their adventure ends and they return to their familiar suburban life. Walkabout is a primarily visual adventure that sets up dichotomies between sterile civilized life and the untamed excitement of the outback.
