  Here's something Natalie Portman said to Zhang Ziyi while interviewing her for a magazine:When I was in school I took a class with Cornel West  who's this amazing African-American Studies professor  and he would say that in America there's this sort of racism against Asians where they say  "Oh  you know  they all look alike." He believed the reason is that Americans don't take enough time to look. Yet that's actually proved beneficial because you can play someone who's Japanese  as you do in Memoirs of a Geisha.Clueless orientalism reason enough for ya?
