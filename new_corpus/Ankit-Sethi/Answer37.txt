  The second season of the anime is going to take over a year to come out so I don't think the wait is worth it because the plot moves from sweeping action and war tactics into political intrigue soon after season one ends  which means there's more dialogue-heavy plot  something manga can do as well or better than anime.I started reading the manga immediately after the anime ended and it was worth it. The characters might be slightly differently named or there might be some additional details you'd need to absorb but for the most part  there's not much overhead in switching.The scenes with 3D maneuver gear seem a little less impressive but that's mitigated if you've seen the anime and can extrapolate the full complexity of the movement depicted on paper.I will add though that one can breezily binge through the manga much faster than the anime (it took me a few hours to catch up to the latest) so you will probably end up flooded with names and information and will need a second reading to absorb it all.
