I think about how it's true but at the same time it's undercut but how there are levels to the whole thing. I know some crappy books (Coelho etc.) that everyone I know has read. I think about this quote and feel better about myself because I've avoided ever getting into them. But then if I focus a little closer to my subset of literary type friends  we all  are cool about hating him and we all love the actually profound and beautiful writers  guys like Murakami in fact. But then this quote starts to bug me again  and I think - oh okay  I'm slightly better than the rest of my friends because I've read Jonathan Franzen  unlike everybody else I know (context: talking about Indian friends).
