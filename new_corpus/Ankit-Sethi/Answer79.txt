A feminism practiced without taking cognizance of the varied intersecting identities (of race  class  gender  sexuality etc) held by an individual -- each affecting an individual's place in social hierarchies of power -- is hobbled by blinkered views of what issues are "truly" important and pressing. So quite simply  the most privileged women are the ones with the most time and ability to talk the talk and walk the walk  the cultural spotlight will swivel towards "their" issues.Oh  and in case there is any doubt  your observation is not some "gotcha" moment that exposes feminism's hollow core.
