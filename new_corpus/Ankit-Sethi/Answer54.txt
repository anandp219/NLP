  Hmmm  lets see:My choice; to be a size 0 or a size 15I wince a bit still for the moment "size 15" is spoken the image we see on screen is that of a pregnant woman. Would an actual size 15 on screen have been too radical a notion? This attempt at solidarity with plus sized women falls short of actually doing them the kindness of actual representation. The bigger problem here is the manner in which a smooth  linear quantization of women's bodies is proposed and championed. By suggesting that a woman is "free" to be span the whole range of 0-15  what Vogue is actually doing is exploiting a cognitive bias called Anchoring which is the tendency for humans to focus on the first piece of information presented to them when conducting a negotiation.
