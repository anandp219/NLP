  Okay I'm coming into this with good faith and trying to engage with her video as art  since she says she intends it to be so.I was confused about her intentions as well  and I didn't find the video very erotic or even emotionally resonant as some art has done for me. The "turn" in the second half where it got violent was somewhat disturbing.Amid the great vitriol and whore/rape/slut categories of comments I saw in the comments section on that page  there were some thoughtful explorations of what the purpose of this video might be.
