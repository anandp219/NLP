  Although her exact motivations are not revealed  her exchange with Leo is revealing. She mentions that he's not what she thought he would be like. She also mentioned some bad history with her own alcoholic father. What I got out of this was that her father had been the same kind of "bad" alcoholic that Leo's own father had been. On learning Leo's history she jumped to a hasty conclusion that he too must have been similarly terrible and is possibly still compromising the integrity of his office.Leo understands that her action came from a place of personal conviction - that a potentially compromised public official should not get to hide his past if his job has important responsibilities.
