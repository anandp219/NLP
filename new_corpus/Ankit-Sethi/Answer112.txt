At the very baseline level  I feel she is saying that her making and putting up the video voluntarily does not excuse thoughtless viewing  of considering intellectual and moral restrictions that might still be applicable which we are to supposed to impose on ourselves and then live up to unsupervised by her or society. If that sounds like a simply ridiculous standard of consent  well then perhaps it is intentionally so - a way to shock a population that often has a ridiculously low standard of consent.The video also invites us to think about the rape we commit in the viewing.
