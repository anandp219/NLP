I personally know of people whose parents' marriages are in such doldrums (or perhaps 9th circle of hell would be more apropos). For women in such marriages  who have perhaps never given a thought to prioritizing their own well being over family appearances  it would be a vital and crucial idea for them to start thinking about having an affair with mutual consent with a partner that can make them happy.The overall problem  I feel  is that Indian people's anxieties about dating in the modern age tend to make them think of romantic coupling as (in part or whole) an adversarial endeavor while completely ignoring the great role adultery can provide as a pressure valve in so many hellish relationships among the older arranged-marriage generation which actually are adversarial and absolutely horrible and torturous.
