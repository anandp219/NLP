Imagery signifying menarche (spilled ketchup on an apron) marks such transitional points and eventually there is another exchange of roles towards an final synthesis of personalities. What I find interesting about this movie is that despite its professed origins as a dream  with all the lack of logic inherent  the plot tends itself easily to an allegorical reading of women in different stages of female life  growing up  regressing  trading places. Willie  the one woman comfortable in her own skin  is involved in a crisis at the end of the film that leads to a final scene of seeming resolution - three woman living communally  perhaps all three roles and minds and bodies now merged into one.
