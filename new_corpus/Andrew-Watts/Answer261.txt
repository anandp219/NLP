1400 to ca. 1600 points out that Ockeghems interest in this specific method was a rarity for the time:The record for this canon is not so extensive as for the motet  probably not least because in contrast to motets  mensuration and proportion canons form a miniscule part of the total repertoire of Renaissance music  and no composer apart from Ockeghem seems to have shown a sustained interest in them. In order to find a historical precursor to Missa Prolationum with a high probability that Ockeghem would have studied as an example of a rigorous mensuration canon  one may have to widen the search beyond the Franco-Flemish School.
