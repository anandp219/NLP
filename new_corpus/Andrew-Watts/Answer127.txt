Unlike Cobra  there is a score  albeit laid out in an open  modular way. There is no conductor per se  however  the the straight 8th note high C's of the pulse for a piano or mallet instrument functions in a similar way to a conductor. Furthermore  the current (2005) edition of the score Riley publishes contains the following instructions:All performers play from the same page of 53 melodic patterns played in sequence. A group of about 35 creates a rich full overlay but interesting performances have been created with many more or many less.Patterns are to be played consecutively  with each performer having the freedom to determine how many times he or she will repeat each pattern before moving to the next.
