  I recently detailed how the human voice is manipulated in Lucier's I am sitting in a room in What about the "natural voice" is musical in Schwitters' Ursonate? How does this compare with the musical characteristics of Lucier's I Am Sitting in a Room? The following is an analysis of the voice in Harvey's Mortuos Plango  Vivos Voco adapted from a research paper I wrote entitled: Use Your Illusion: An Analysis of Illusionary Compositional Techniques in Jonathan Harvey's Mortuos Plango  Vivos Voco and Maryanne Amacher's Synaptic IslandTo begin  it is important to understand how the concept for the work was derived from the Latin inscription on the great tenor bell at Winchester Cathedral  England: Horas Avolantes Numero  Mortuos Plango: Vivos ad Preces Voco (I count the fleeing hours  I lament the dead: the living I call to prayer).
