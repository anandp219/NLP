I do have one big advantage when it comes to this countdown-- I have been planning the piece and researching the musical context like my life depended on it for weeks beforehand. Even though the first note has not yet been scribbled on the first measure  all of the macro elements of the composition have been thoroughly conceived. So  when it is "go-time" I am truly in the zone and working at a rate of quite high productivity. A representative example of a writing day for me would look like this:08:00AM Wake up  use the restroom  then sit at my desk.
