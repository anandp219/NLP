Xenakis achieves his sound-cloud textures through mathematical structures and probabilities  taking data derived from such equations to determine starting and ending pitches/attack times/durations  then transcribing them to music paper.Though the term "micropolyphony" is strongly tired to Ligeti  there are composers with earlier works utilizing similar means  as well as several composers afterwards who were directly influenced by Ligeti. To collect recommendations of specific individuals who have written micropolyphonic pieces I conducted a cursory search through the Oxford Music Online and JSTOR databases.
