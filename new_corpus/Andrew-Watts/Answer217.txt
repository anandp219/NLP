As more and more voices are given independent lines (especially with the highly chromatic vertical sonorities) there is a tipping point where  as Ligeti puts it: The polyphonic structure does not come through  you cannot hear it; it remains hidden in a microscopic  underwater world  to us inaudible.Functionality in Threnody: Taking a look at the score  the opening for Threnody does not reveal a metrically strict texture made up of fully notated rhythms. Rather  Penderecki is able to achieve similar saturated pitch clusters through the differences in musical interpretation within a large group.
