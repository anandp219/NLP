Of these I can hear similarities between Luciano Berio (the third movement of his Sinfonia)  Alfred Schnittke (Concerto Grosso no.1)  Mauricio Kagel (Ludwig van)  Carl Orff (Carmina Burana)  Krzysztof Penderecki (St. Luke Passion)  Karlheinz Stockhausen (Hymen)  and Igor Stravinsky (Pulcinella). Zorn describes in A Bookshelf On Top of the Sky an affinity for block form as used by Stravinsky and later Stockhausen. Zorn calls this "moment form  where each moment is complete in itself  like building blocks.
