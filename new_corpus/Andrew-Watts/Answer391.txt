The effect is  according to Ligeti  that--[...]you cannot actually hear the polyphony  the canon. You hear a kind of impenetrable texture  something like a very densely woven cobweb. I have retained melodic lines in the process of composition  they are governed by rules as strict as Palestrina's or those of the Flemish school  but the rules of this polyphony are worked out by me. The polyphonic structure does not come through  you cannot hear it; it remains hidden in a microscopic  underwater world  to us inaudible.
