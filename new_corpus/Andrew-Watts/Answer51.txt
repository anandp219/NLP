Microtonality  as seen in 3 Quarter Tones Piano Pieces through the 24 EDO (equal divisions of the octave)  is understood to be more nuanced than chromaticism due to the availability of smaller melodic gradations. If one were to continue on with Ives' progression of expressivity via smaller divisions of the octave  pentatonic to diatonic to chromatic to quarter-tone  Georg Friedrich Haas' Limited Approximations would represent two notches further along the continuum; as it utilizes 1/6th and 1/12th tones in addition to quarter-tones.
