Haas builds a feeling of the single mind generating gestures through the efforts of six individuals. Perhaps a more appropriate imagery for his 72 EDO piano temperament would be a multi-manual piano akin to the Haba and Wyschnegradsky examples  only with six keyboards on the solo instrument rather than two. For as much trouble as Ives had with procuring a quarter-tone piano and the related issues in performance practicalities  Haas' troubles would have been even greater for a hypothetical six manual 1/12th tone piano.
