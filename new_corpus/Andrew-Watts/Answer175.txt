Lastly  Lachenmann has spoken of composition as equivalent to building an instrument  and Mosch is quick to point out that "this is as true of his attitude to solo instruments as it is to his approach to ensembles or orchestras." During the 2015 highSCORE lecture Lachenmann used Morton Feldmans piece The Viola in my Life as an example  calling Pression "The Cello in my Life." Orning's assessment of Pression corroborates this ideal  as "the cello as the sound source we know is eliminated  so the cello as a traditional instrument with all its connotations and history is on one level erased through this compositional method."
