Classical music  from solo recitals and chamber ensembles to symphony orchestras and opera productions  is best as a communal experience. Conductors  composers  and music scholars frequently give pre-concert talks or lectures. Be sure to arrive at the venue early to hear these  as they are highly illuminating. In fact  concertgoers who are new to classical music and tying to get into the genre often tell me that they enjoy performances much more after hearing someone talk about the program. Watch closely to the physical movements and gestures of the conductor and performers.
