In the article Ives' Quarter-Tone Impressions  author Howard Boatwright suggests that the composer's sensibilities regarding temperament were likely influenced early on by his father George Ives' quarter-tone machine. This device consisted of twenty-four (or more) violin strings that could be tuned in various ways. The elder Ives used it to pick out quarter-tone melodies and try to get his family to sing them. Later on in an effort to better train the ear to hear quarter-tone melodies  George Ives developed a way to sustain the strings using weights and violin bows  allowing for quarter-tone harmonies.
