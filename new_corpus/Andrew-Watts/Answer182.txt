When Zorn is performing with Naked City the focus is similar. However  with Romitelli the musicians are ideally existing as conduits for the drama to pass through. Regardless of how absurd their actions may be it is always about the act and not the performer himself/herself. In Trash TV Trance these actions include a circular motion using a drum stick to "bow" the strings on the neck of the instrument. In addition to the specific sound generated by this extended technique  a certain ritualistic quality akin to the fragile monodramas of Mauricio Kagel is created.Regarding Spectralism  after attending at the Accademia Chigiana in Siena and later at the Scuola Civica in Milan  Romitelli continued his studies at IRCAM in Paris.
