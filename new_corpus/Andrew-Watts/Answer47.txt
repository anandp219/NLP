  BackgroundFor 3 Quarter Tone Piano Pieces instructions for tuning are provided in the score preface and read:The quarter-tone relationship between the two pianos may be accomplished by one of two methods. Ives suggests that one piano be tuned a quarter-tone higher than the other. This procedure is not looked upon with favor by piano technicians. They prefer to take one piano down a quarter-tone. If this latter procedure is adopted  the part written to be played by the quarter-tone higher piano should be played by the piano at normal pitch  while the part written for the normal pitch piano should be taken by the piano tuned down a quarter-tone.
