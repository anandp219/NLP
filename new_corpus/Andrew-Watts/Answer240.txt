One of the fellows whose residency overlapped with mine was Sharon Charde  and over the few weeks we were both at VCCA we chatted quite a bit. Our conversations were different from those I would have at other institutes and festivals with composers. After a day or so with a composer I would have a clear idea about how their music would sound and how they relate to their art form before even seeing a score or hearing a recording/performance. With Sharon we spoke about PBS programs  about interpersonal relationships  about graduate school (I was probably a bundle of nerves waiting to hear back after my Stanford interview)  and so on.
