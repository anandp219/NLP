In the article Raphal Cendo  Registre des lumires  author Nathan Cornelius outlines saturation (seen in Cendo's works) as-- [] overloading the sonic environment so that unforeseen qualities emerge in it  like overloading a microphone with a signal so strong that it generates distortion or feedback. This process can take many forms  such as dense unsynchronized textures  radical extended techniques  or the buildup of contrasting timbres (tone colors).Timbral saturation is then described as-- [] stretching listeners ability to perceive many diverse sound qualities at once.
