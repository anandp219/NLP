In an interview between critic Joseph Dalto and Talea Ensemble's Alex Lipowski before a New York concert of Romitelli's works  Lipowski also makes several comparisons to Hendrix:He wants you to experience a sensory overload[...] It's often thick and dirty  really raw  like psychedelic rock would be[...] You can lose yourself in the music  because it's transcendental. So get ready for the Romitelli experience. Like the Jimi Hendrix experience  it will be radical and experimental and hopefully transformative.Along the same lines of hybridisation between contemporary classical music and more popular genres would be John Zorn  particularly his work with Naked City.
