In the 1960s saturation was seen in works like Ligeti's Lux Aeterna via "micropolyphony " Penderecki's Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima via "tone clusters " and Xenakis' Pithoprakta via "sound-cloud" textures. Though given different technical names  each of these composers is achieving the same sonic resultant  a saturation of the total chromatic through the motion of many independent lines. With the music of Scelsi  such as his String Quartet no.5  he is taking that same instrumental method to saturate a frequency band and compressing it to a much smaller interval  moving from chromatic or dodecaphonic activity to microtonal activity.
