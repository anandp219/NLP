The concept of klangfarbenmelodie or tone color melody is often credited to the Second Viennese School  in particular Arnold Schoenberg. Bannach asserts that timbre then truly became an independent component in the 1950s when Serialism became a prominent movement in classical music  from the likes of Stockhausen  Babbit  Boulez  and others. This focus on various timbres and the way they evolve in an acoustical space over time is the primary concern throughout Threnody. In the book To Cut the Gordian Knot: The Timbre System of Krzysztof Penderecki  author Danuta Mirka theorizes that Pendereckis interest in such topics may have been through the acoustician Mieczyslaw Drobner:It is likely that such a splendidly simplified image of the sound producing process was taken up by Penderecki from the teaching of Mieczyslaw Drobner  the eminent Polish acoustician and organologist.
