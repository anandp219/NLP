As with most artist residencies  the fellows are given a room and private studio to work on their respective project. During mealtimes everyone comes together at the dining room and socializes. At VCCA there is also a tradition of weekly readings  performances  and gallery showings by the current fellows after dinner on a given evening. This is a great  low-key opportunity for everyone to share a bit about their discipline among such a multidisciplinary group. The evening presentations throughout my time there were always a highlight; not only because of the high level each artist was working at  but also because it allowed me to see a different side of an individual that had perhaps remained hidden through the friendly discourse and daily small talk.
