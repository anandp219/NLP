What serialism offered Lachenmann  according to biographer Ulrich Mosch  was "this concept of sound as the outcome and expression of abstract ideas of order." Another aspect of serialism  as practiced by Boulez and Stockhausen  which may have influenced Lachenmann was the possibility to give greater independence to the various musical characteristics (dynamics  pitches  rhythms  timbres  etc)  with the composer calling this the "anatomy" of sound. Mosch points out that for Lachenmann those characteristics "denote the concrete situation: listening  you hear the conditions under which a sound or noise action is carried out  you hear what materials and energies are involved and what resistance is encountered.
