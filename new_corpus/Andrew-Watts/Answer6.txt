Finally  (overlapping with these glissandi) these is another  expanding set of glissandi with vibrato  leading into the bell strike for Section 3. [The following figure] uses a sonogram to show this transformation in outline  and [the subsequent figure] shows its pitch structure in more detail  using semibreves to represent pivot notes. The move from the recorded Pre to a synthesized imitation enables the sound to be transformed. The synthesized sine waves can glissando independently  each by different amounts  toward the partials of the bell.
