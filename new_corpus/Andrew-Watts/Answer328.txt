According to biographer Arnold Whittall:During the mid1960s [Harvey] became increasingly aware of new attitudes to time and space in the music of Stockhausen (on whom he published a monograph in 1975)  and a period of study at Princeton with Babbitt strengthened his concern with posttonal compositional systems as well as with the possibilities of electroacoustic techniques. [] But for Harvey  like Stockhausen  the best way to explore the special character of the single note was by means of electroacoustics  and as an early recruit to IRCAM he found Boulezs Paris Institute a stimulating environment for the development of his technical and aesthetic predispositions.One could imagine that Stockhausens Gesang der Jnglinge ("Song of the Youths")  often called the first masterpiece of electronic music  was of particular influence while writing Mortuos plango.
