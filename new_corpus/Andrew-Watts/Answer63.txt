Ives (again via the score preface) characterizes I. Largo as [...] primarily diatonic  using quarter-tones as passing tones or suspensions and quarter-tone chords as extensions or variants. For II. Allegro Ives is even more dismissive  stating [it] is mostly made of rhythms contrasted or 'split' between the two pianos. From a pure quarter-tone harmonic standpoint it doesn't amount to much.The parallelisms in the final sections of each work are  however  fortuitous. Like many of Ives' compositions the last movement incorporates a chorale.
