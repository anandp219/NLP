Unlike I am sitting in a room and similar to Idle Chatter  Mortuos Plango uses fragmentation and reordering of the chorister sound samples  further obscuring the distorting the original meaning of the text. For Come Out the relationship between the voice and text is somewhere between the linear (A transitioning to B) I am sitting in a room and the multi-directional/fragmented (A to B  B to A  A-B-A  B-A-B  etc) Mortuos Plango  Vivos Voco. Come Out functions with a strict process piece identity and an inevitability of outcome shared with I am sitting in a room  but also maintains the fragmentation  reordering of phrases  and multi-directionality of Mortuos Plango Vivos Voco.
