Sound mass has been used to describe sections of a number of works by Ligeti  Penderecki  Xenakis  Lutosawski  Ives  Stockhausen  Crumb  as well as others. Another way of thinking about it is that micropolyphonic compositions will likely result in a sound mass texture  but not all sound mass textures require micropolyphonic compositional techniques.Functionality in Lux Aeterna: In the opening of the piece Ligeti constructs a cantus firmus in measures 1-24 using the pitch F as the central note of the trichord E-flat  F  and A-flat (or {0 2 5} for those of you who deal in Babbitt-style pitch classes).
