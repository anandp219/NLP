Romitelli combines these  often using timbral saturation to fuse such disparate elements together. Regarding the popular music link in Trash TV Trance  it is difficult to ignore the likeness to certain timbres and electric guitar techniques pioneered by Jimi Hendrix. The defining feature of Hendrix's solo lead sound  oversatured distortion constantly on the brink of feedback  is shared here. Other characteristics borrowed from such performances as the Star Spangled Banner at Woodstock and Machine Gun at the Filmore East include a reliance of stomp-box effects pedals (wah-wah  chorus  etc)  pick scraping the length of the string  and exaggerated bending/vibrato.
