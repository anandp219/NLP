As long as I have a place to sit and write in my manuscript book (maybe also an outlet for my laptop) I can be equally productive. I never need a board meeting to determine what direction the next project will take. If I get bored I can always change things up; go someplace new  write for instruments I have no experience with  tinker / experiment with other techniques / forms I have only heard in my head  and so on. No one can prevent me from pursuing a given direction in my music or have the authority to tell me otherwise.The deep isolation can be tough  not so much on me (I have always worked well alone)  but on others close to me.
