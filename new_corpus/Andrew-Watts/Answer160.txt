I just got tired  and I couldn't really deal with it. The chattering became chaotic. As soon as I decided to place a B-flat triad in the background  I found myself able to listen to all kinds of things and fascinating qualities emerged. There is kind of a didactic twist to this  for what it's worth. In a way I'm sitting the listener down in a familiar place and then tweaking his ears with a more bizarre context. In this case B flat major is perhaps acting more as a foundation for exploration than as an assertion that tonality has God-given virtue.
