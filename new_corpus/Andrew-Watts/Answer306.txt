These musicians have spent decades honing their craft and it is astonishing how they are able to transform little black dots on a page to expressive narratives. If you can  take a look at the score and parts to "see under the hood" of what is required of them. After the event try to hang around for a little bit and chat with the musicians. Ask them all sorts of questions-- What was their favorite part of the concert? Which passage was the most difficult to learn? Etc.It helps to go with a friend  but even if going alone  do feel free to create a dialogue with other patrons.
