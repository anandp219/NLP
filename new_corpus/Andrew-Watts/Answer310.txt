  In my mind  this sort of inside the piano technique really began with Henry Cowell (1897-1965). His works Aeolian Harp for string piano (ca. 1923) and The Banshee for string piano (1925) were both highly influential. If you have not already checked Cowell's solo piano works out  then I recommend starting here.http://youtu.be/zIZ5vt6a6Uc Next  I would be remiss if I did not then mention John Cage (1912-1992) and his pioneering work Sonatas and Interludes (1946-1948). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
