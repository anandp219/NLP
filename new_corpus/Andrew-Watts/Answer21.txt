The most famous recording  the solo takes with Lewis and Mitchell for the 1993 Avant release  is very much in the avant garde jazz / free improvisation vein. This aesthetic predisposition is not necessarily inherent to the construction of Voyager  but has nevertheless become commonplace with its performances. According to Lewis the Voyager program analyzes aspects of an improvisors performance in real time then generates complex responses to the musicians playing. If you want to hear the program play in a certain way  you figure out how what you want to hear is organized  and you start playing that way yourself.
