  It could be there is some nuance or peculiarity present in most  if not all of the Mozart works you have heard that is lacking in other classical music compositions you have been exposed to thus far. Similarly  I know folks who state that Johnny Cash is the only country music they like. In their case  they probably do not like that genre's defining musical features  but for whatever reason are willing to ignore that for the sake of the artist's individual voice. In this example  they probably really prefer Cash's genre-spanning songs and sound embracing rock and roll  rockabilly  blues  folk  and gospel...in spite of the fact he is primarily remembered as a country music icon.
