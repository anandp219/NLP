Likewise  the number of playback iterations is frequently approximated to match Lucier's recordings  but again need not. Thus  the only control the composer retains is through the certainty of a given speech's loss of articulation and linguistic comprehension through the acoustics of a physical space over time. Of the four works  Harvey retains the most creative control at the micro-level with Mortuos Plango  Vivos Voco; crafting each individual gesture intuitively. Nevertheless  there are still several compositional systems the composer relies on.
