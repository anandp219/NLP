Such textural and rhythmic contrast seems almost archaistically reminiscent of the isorhythmic motets of Dunstable and Dufay. Regarding the influence of his peers of this second generation  it is clear that there was an active practice of contemporary composers setting melodic passages of others within their works. Sometimes this was observed by taking a cantus firmus from one piece by one composer and re-contextualizing it in another piece by another composer. Perkins shows this was common for Ockeghem  and though it reveals a lot about the state of authorship during the era  it makes attribution in an absolute sense even more difficult.
