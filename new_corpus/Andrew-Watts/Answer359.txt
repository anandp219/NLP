This desire to create a new  more just society is at the core Canti di vita e d'amore and was likely influenced by Nono's political background. Borio notes that the Nazi occupation and the Italian Resistance were fundamental to Nono's general development. In 1952 the composer became a member of the Italian Communist Party  and as Durazzi mentions  Canti represents Nono's move away from a kind of leftist idealism and toward more concrete forms of social and political activism. Lastly  there is the influence of Nono's close friends Bruno Maderna and Emilio Vedova.
