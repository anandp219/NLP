It is possible that the similarities between all of these works stem from a late 1950s  early 1960s  increase in textual complexity zeitgeist  rather than peer influence. The use of aleatory is coupled with a time-line notation or proportional notation where rather than meters and bar lines the composer writes durations (in minutes and seconds) for how long a given gesture should last. There is a certain lack of temporal precision inherent in how this time-line notation is used by Penderecki. Add the often similarly indeterminate element of pitch (with indications like as high as possible) and it is clear that the complexity heard in performance far exceeds the complexity shown of the page.
