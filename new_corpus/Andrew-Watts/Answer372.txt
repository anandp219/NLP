With nine instruments Schnee progresses less by intervallic identity (as in Goldberg Variations) and more by total saturation or density of texture. Canon 1a is sparse and transparent in individual lines  and while some of the momentum is carried over to subsequent canons  more active layers are added  effectively expanding on the core pulse. The result is oddly a more linear development in the variations of Schnee than the complex relationships constituting a development throughout the Goldberg Variations.
