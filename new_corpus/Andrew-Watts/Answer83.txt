In the article Text-Sound Art: A Survey (Performing Arts Journal  Vol. 2  No. 2 Autumn  1977  pp. 64) Moholy-Nagy translates the title of Schwitters' Ursonate to "primordial sonata " and goes on to describe it as--[...] a poem of thirty-five minutes duration  containing four movements  a prelude  and a cadenza in the fourth movement. The words do not exist; rather they might exist in any language; they have no logical only an emotional context; they affect the ear with their phonetic vibrations like music.Text-Sound Art: A Survey author Richard Kostelanetz also notes that in recent years  both Eberhard Blum  a German flutist of SUNY-Buffalo  and Peter Froehlich of the English Theatre at the University of Ottawa have performed Ursonate; each of them surpassing Schwitters' own partial recording.
