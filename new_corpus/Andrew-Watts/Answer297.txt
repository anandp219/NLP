The sections of timbral saturation function not as a harmonious embellishments on the preexisting material  but rather the soloist's artistic commentary on the piece itself  virtually re-imagining the work in his own musical language. Trash TV Trance was composed in a world where both Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner and Lachenmann's Pression had already existed for over 30 years.
