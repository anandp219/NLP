Carl notes that in contrast to Young's more theoretical approach to composition  Riley "remained more of a jazzer in his outlook  playing saxophone and keyboards  and improvising as part of his practical  professional life." Furthermore  also while at Berkeley Riley joined Oliveros and Rush to form an improvisation trio  playing piano with the former on French horn and the latter on koto and percussion.
