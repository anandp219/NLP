Penderecki takes this to the next logical place and essentially composes the human differences of interpretation and performance practice in Threnody. Without being told exactly when to re-articulate the bow  or exactly what pitch to play  and without the familiar structure of measures/meters; natural microscopic differences in playing and improvisation contribute to the same saturation for Threnody that is heard in Lux Aeterna.The differentiation between these two compositional methodologies is therefore beyond labels and the aesthetics of notation  it is a matter of decision making.
