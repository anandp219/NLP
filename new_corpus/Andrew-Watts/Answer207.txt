I disagree with this perpetuated belief that after a certain age one will not be able to become a professional musician  but unfortunately this is a self-fulfilling prophesy. After a bit of research into figures who are commonly mentioned as late bloomers through various anecdotes and classroom asides  it turns out that often these individuals still had some formal musical training during their childhood. The anecdotes fail to emphasize this and focus on the point (usually late teens) where the musicians becomes serious about his or her craft and seeks highly rigorous training.
