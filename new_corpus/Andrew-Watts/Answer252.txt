German musicologist Hermann Abert first published this obsessive book (a magnum opus in its own right) as three volumes in 1923-24. 80 years later translator Stewart Spencer and editor Professor Cliff Eisen have completed the staggering task of creating an English version as one single edition; adding 200 000 words of footnotes and annotations  as well as taking into account the decades of Mozart scholarship since Abert's work first appeared.The publisher  Yale University Press  describes the biography as:Hermann Abert's classic biography  first published in German more than eighty years ago and itself based on the definitive mid-nineteenth century study by Otto Jahn  remains the most informed and substantial biography of Mozart in any language.
