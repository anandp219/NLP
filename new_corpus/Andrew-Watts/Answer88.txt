Chambers. Middletown  Conn: Wesleyan University Press  1980. Musical score.Also in the preface for I am sitting in a room  Lucier instructs the performer to choose a room the musical qualities of which you would like to evoke. Like the Schwitters piece  Lucier's score is void of any typical musical instruction or standardized notation: no rhythms  no meters  no pitches. Similarly  the performer  though often a musician like with Ursonate  does not need to be. The first distinction between the two works is that one could now argue the text for I am sitting in a room is not even structured musically.
