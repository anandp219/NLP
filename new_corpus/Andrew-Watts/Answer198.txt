"Substantial training" often means already having earned a master's degree in composition  participated in international music festivals  garnered professional commissions  and premiers with top ensembles/soloists. All of these components take time and are difficult to attain at any age  especially for young composers still searching for their voice. Those beginning a doctoral program at a larger school of music or at an institution with stand-alone master's programs are often younger. 24-25 years old is quite normal here because these schools commonly accept students from their own master's program into their doctoral program upon graduation.
