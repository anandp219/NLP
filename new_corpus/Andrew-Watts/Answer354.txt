Nevertheless  some of the relationships are uncanny. Nono has written about his lifelong study of Italian Renaissance choral composers Gabrieli and Gesualdo with regard to their use of spatialization  as well as figures from the Franco-Flemish School. Ligeti attributes much of the influence for his micropolyphony technique  especially as used in Lux Aeterna and Requiem  to Johannes Ockeghem  arguably the most famous composer of the Franco-Flemish School. Another specific connection between Canti di vita e d'amore and Ligeti's music is the method of pitch choice between each individual instrument.
