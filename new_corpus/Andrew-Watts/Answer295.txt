It is clear that the most notable  and subsequently imitated  aspects of Hendrix's version of the Star Spangled Banner were not in any way indicated through the notated composition. The aggressive whammy-bar dives  frequent forays into amplifier feedback  and quick chromatic alterations between thick extended chords (foreign to the original song) contribute to the characteristic timbral saturation of this Woodstock performance. Interestingly  this was not the first time Hendrix had performed the Star Spangled Banner--by a long shot.
