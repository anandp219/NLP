Musicologist and harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick expounds on this systematic approach to the variations in the preface to the 1938 G. Schirmer edition to the score. As an example  variation 3 is a canon at the unison  variation 6 is a canon at the second  variation 9 is a canon at the third  and so on until variation 27  a canon at the ninth. Kirkpatrick goes on to note that the variations that intervene between the canons are also arranged in a pattern. After each canon are genre pieces of various types  among them three Baroque dances (4  7  19); a fughetta (10); a French overture (16); and two ornate arias for the right hand (13  25).
