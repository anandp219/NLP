One primary distinction is the use of independent lines. Though achieved through different means (aleatory vs. notated polyphony)  this feature unifies Xenakis  Ligeti  and Penderecki. Nono uses the same large scale divisi and pitch distribution  but often without the independent  individualized movements within each divisi texture. It is possible that the similarities between all of these works stem from a late 1950s  early 1960s  increase in textual complexity zeitgeist  rather than peer influence.
