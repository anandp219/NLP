The canons are grouped into pairs (1a  1b  2a  2b  etc). Three intermezzi are also interspersed throughout the work  further dividing the hour-long time scale into sections. Unlike the Bach  these canons are not built off of a theme inherent aspect of the original (for instance the bass line). Rather  variation takes place via the addition of new motifs while retaining others in a static role. This creates a thread connecting the different canons and provides a sense of subtle growth from point A to B over a long stretch  then (still unhurried) back to A.
