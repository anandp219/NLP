When a performer is not playing  she should be conscious of the larger periodic composite accents that are sounding. When she reenters she must be aware of what affect [sic] the entrance will have on the overall flow.The ensemble should aim to merge into a unison at least once  but preferable [sic] often during the course of a performance. If all patterns seemed to be played too much in unison a player should try to offset his pattern by and [sic] 1/8th note or other value so as to create a feeling of shifting alignments.
