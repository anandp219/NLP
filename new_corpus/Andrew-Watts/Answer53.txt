Publisher Universal Edition has included statements from the composer regarding the composition on their website. Here Haas remarks that:limited approximations does not tell a story. As with all my compositions  there is also no formal development or traditional formal structure. Contrasting elements alternate with one another  moments of smoothness and friction. Pseudo-glissandi in the pianos arrive unexpectedly at overtone chords. Apparently stable constellations of intervals begin to falter as the twelfth-tones merge.The spectral  telescoping chords of the pianos are taken up by the orchestra  over and over again.
