During a 	performance there are no extemporaneous compositional decisions 	being made by the musician  and thus  no improvisation takes place.Another 	case for strict indeterminacy would be if the composer relinquished 	creative control over an parameter of the music to the performer  	but the performer makes a decision about the choice before playing 	(i.e. not extemporaneously). The examples of this The 	Oxford Companion to Music	provides include the works of Lutosawski and Henze where certain 	passages may have the performer repeat a fragment an indefinite 	number of times or choose a rhythm for a given set of pitches.
