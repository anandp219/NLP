Thus  I poured over hundreds of short works in various collections and anthologies. I eventually settled on Mark Strand's piece Eating Poetry. Much like the realization that I favor absurdity in humor as a high school senior  through this quest for a text I realized as a college senior that I favor surrealism in poetry.While at Oxford for my master's I focused deeper into modernism. The most helpful and engaging publications I encountered were Marguerite Boland and John Link's Elliott Carter Studies  and Iannis Xenakis' Formalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in Composition  and David Metzer's Musical Modernism at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century.
