Volume  sounding duration  octave  register  interval width  pitches used  volume range  frequency of silence  and articulation are checked and averaged over time.All of this is passed to the music-generating processes. Many of the same parameters found in the input are passed to the output  such as frequency of silence  volume  sounding duration  octave  register  interval width  volume range  and articulation. Other important musical choices are generated internally via random numbers. These processes provide much of the personality of the system  and include melody and harmony  orchestration  ornamentation  pacing  transposition  rhythm  and internal behavior options  such as whether and how to react to input  or how quickly to change parameter and which should be changed.
