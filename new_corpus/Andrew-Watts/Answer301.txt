Which account am I supposed to believe? No matter how faithful the author (or in the case of films  director) attempts to be  there are simply too many fictitious  often Romanticized versions of Beethoven out there. The closest thing to truth is the catalog of works he left behind. Many of his original manuscripts still exist and function as a document of his intent. This is the definitive Beethoven.Therefore  I do not view Beethoven to be anything more or less than a great composer. To be a great composer is in fact high praise  and to be considered one of the greatest composers of all time by musicians and non-musicians alike is perhaps the highest praise anyone devoting their life to composition could hope for.
