Brewed in the Saison style from Pilsner malt and Kent Goldings and Styrian Goldings hops. Originally titled "Saison Vielle Provision"  the beer was also dry-hopped until the brewery stopped this practice in favor of a larger late hop addition in the boil. Unfiltered and bottle-conditioned  Saison Dupont is packaged in green glass bottles of a thickness appropriate to withstand the substantial carbonation. The bottles are finished with a champagne-style cork and wire cage.Old AleTheakston Old Peculier - T & R Theakston Ltd.
