Unfortunately  my early interests rarely fit into the literature classes at school. It felt like the curriculum was made up entirely of novels taking place in rural pre-1900 America. I grew up in a quite rural area myself and lived in a house surrounded by cornfields and soybean fields as far as the eye could see. Needless to say  I was less than enthusiastic about these mandatory books on frontier life. I knew first hand what living out in the country was like and these romanticized depictions not only bored me  but left me with a suspicion that I perhaps hated reading.
