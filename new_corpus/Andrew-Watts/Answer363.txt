  The most fundamental difference I see is the multiplicity of discrete variations on a theme (Bach)  versus continuous variation through repetition (Abrahamsen). Before going deeper into a comparison  I will first examine how each composer structured their respective work. The Goldberg Variations represent the most extended single composition for the harpsichord Bach ever wrote. The 30 variations utilize the bass line of the Aria (shown below) as a formal constraint to create different variations on top of.
