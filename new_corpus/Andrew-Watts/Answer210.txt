  I touched upon this briefly in Have composers other than Ligeti used micropolyphony?What separated Ligeti and his micropolyphony technique from his contemporaries was the means of achieving the pitch clusters. Penderecki produces his extensive elaborations on tone clusters by aleatoric means  often involving a multitude of glissandi effects with indeterminate repetitions of attacks and entrances.To examine this comparison closer I will be using Ligeti's Lux Aeterna (1966) for 16 solo singers and Penderecki's Threnody (1960) for 52 string instruments as examples.
