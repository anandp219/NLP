Here Nono sets a poem by Jesus Lopez Pacheco in which the tortured Algerian student of the title begs: "to see things like a child" and to be free from "this night of blood  this endless mud." Nono scores this for solo soprano (unaccompanied)  allowing the audience to impose the girl from the text onto the vocalist. The last movement Tu is set to the words of Cesare Pavese and anticipates a new dawn for society. According to Borio  Nono redefined Utopia through his own concepts of other ways of listening and possible infinities.
