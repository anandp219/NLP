For instance  Perkins notes that the attribution to Ockeghem of Ut heremita solus is implied in Crtins Dploration; the work may have been Ockeghems reply to Busnoys In hydraulis. For Missa Prolationum Perkins goes so far as to assert that Ockeghem artfully concealed the execution of certain compositional materials in accordance with the principal aesthetic ideals of the period  as articulated  for example  by Tinctoris. Consequently  the unfamiliar features of Ockeghems style continue to pose problems for present analysis.Nevertheless  there has been a great deal of analysis regarding the form and structure in Ockeghems works.
