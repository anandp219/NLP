Keeping on top of academics  e-mails  grant proposals  festival applications  composition competitions  and mundane housework never provides more than an hour or so of daily free time during the term. Thus  I usually have to wait until the breaks between the university semesters to get a lot of music written. As it happens  this "vacation" period often coincides with the 11th hour before a commission/deadline is due. The pressure is on  the concepts have been germinating in my consciousness (maybe subconscious too) for months now  and my focus is like a laser-beam.
