Furthermore  variations located two after each canon (5  8  11  14  17  20  23  26  and 29) are what Kirkpatrick calls "arabesques"; they are variations in lively tempo with a great deal of hand-crossing. The moments of greatest profundity  in my experience  during the Goldberg Variations are the unexpected places Bach is able to arrive at later in the composition. After so many creative takes on G major  the G minor arrivals in variations 15  21  and 25 feel substantial. In particular  Variatio 21.
