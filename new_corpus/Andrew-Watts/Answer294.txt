The Star Spangled Banner is an example of a contrafactum: new lyrics set to existing music. In this case  the music was initially "The Anacreontic Song"  also known as "To Anacreon In Heaven"  and functioned as the official song of the Anacreontic Society  an 18th-century gentlemen's club of amateur musicians in London. It is fascinating how this Colonial-Era  British drinking song has transformed over the centuries-- with Francis Scott Key penning new lyrics during the Defense of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812  to its later revisions and subsequent publication as a patriotic song  to the song's official designation as the U.S. national anthem in 1931  to represent the unbridled freedom sought by the late 1960s counter-culture via this iconic Hendrix rendition.
