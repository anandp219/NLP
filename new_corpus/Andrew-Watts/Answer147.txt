  Deconstructing the Technology in Idle ChatterAt its source  the voice heard in the Idle Chatter series of works by Paul Lansky is his wife Hannah MacKay. After recording the spoken text  text that is not ever revealed by the composer  MacKay's voice is used with a Linear Prediction Coding (LPC) algorithm. According to Lansky in a conversation with Jeffrey Perry published in Perspectives of New Music (1996)  the Linear Predictive Coding rapidly changes banks of formant filters. Lansky goes on to say-- I just isolate words  sort of flatten the pitch contours a bit  and then transpose them.
