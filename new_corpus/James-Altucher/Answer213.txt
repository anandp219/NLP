  There are zero good books about writing. They are scams. Many people will say  "Stephen King's 'On Writing'". Total scam. For one thing  the book is about Stephen King having a truck hit him while he was reading while he was walking in the middle of the road. If you want to be a good writer  don't do that. Don't read and walk in the middle of the road. Some people will say  "Ray Bradbuy's 'Zen and the Art of Writing'". This is a good book but not a book about writing. It's a collection of essays about all the things Ray Bradbury has been interested in in his life.
