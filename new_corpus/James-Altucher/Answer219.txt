But stick to what happens. ("Then the explosions came...") Don't focus on being flowery with you writing. I do think reading helps you use virtual mentors to teach you how to do some writing. But it depends on what kind of writing you want to do. If you want to write mystery novels  read a lot of popular mystery novels. That will make you a better mystery novel writer. BUT ONLY if you follow one trick: once you have figured out "the rules" on the popular mystery novels  be strong enough to change them a bit.
