He said  first thing  Make an audiobook. For your kind of book  people will love listening to it while they drive into work.So Claudia  my wife who has been supportive of every aspect of this effort  set up her office in our house to be a mini-recording studio. I wrote to Tucker Max that I was going to make an audiobook. He wrote back:James  where are you doing the audio  and whos editing it? Please tell me you arent just doing it yourself with your Mac and a mic you bought online.We looked at our Mac and a mic that we had just bought online and decided to go to a professional studio.
