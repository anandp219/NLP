  After losing over one million a week  cash  for the entire summer of 2000  I was forced to sell my apartment. So one day in 2002  all the boxes were packed  the apartment was empty. We had two moving trucks waiting downstairs to move us an hour north of the city. It was like an exile. My self-esteem was gone  my apartment was gone  I hadnt slept a full night in almost three years  and other things I cant even talk about. My ex-wife  my two toddler girls  and Lynne  a close family friend who was helping us move  were taking one last look around.
