For instance  take Scrabble. It might take you 1000 hours to remember all the 3 letter words  all the 4 letter words with Js and Qs. All the 6 letter "Stems" (a stem is six letters that  if almost any other letter is added  you have a legal 7 letter word  e.g. S A T I N E. Add "X" to that and you have "Antisex". Add "E" to that and you have "Etesian" and so on. There are about 20 useful stems). It will take you about 1000 hours to do that plus learn basic strategy and then you will be among the best in the world.
