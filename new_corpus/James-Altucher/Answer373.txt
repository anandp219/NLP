And that became my trademarked technique for losing everything  For losing my mind. For being lonely.It was the one thing that worked: 1% decrease a day cost me everything. I had to get back to 1% up a day.The 1% Rule can be applied to everything. If I spend 1 less minute feeling regret and use that to feel gratitude  how much better for my stress levels will that be2 in one years time.Stress is 100% reverse correlated with longer healthier happier life. With more money. With more love. With more creativity.Every habit can be built using this technique.Thoughts are in the head.
