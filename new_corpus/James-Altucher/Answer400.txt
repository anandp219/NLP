And Im just vomiting them out. When you listen  you learn. When you learn  you get better. When you get better you start to have a vision  you start to over deliver  you get more creative  and all the other good things above. Im going on a word diet. 2500 words a day. MAX. I might not succeed (its an experiment) but Im hoping I learn more today. And tomorrow. Listening is a form of giving credit. It means you value the words of other. Listening is a form of integrity. Because everyone offers something  you acknowledge that.
