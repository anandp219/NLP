No exaggeration. People got on line at 5am to get into the meeting. Krispy Kreme donuts were served on the line outside. Then  when it was time to go in  everyone RAN in order to get a good seat. But since they had just cleaned the floors everyone was slipping  falling  sliding as soon as they got into the building. It was exactly what would happen if everyone was running to escape  well  a nuclear attack.The night before the meeting there were some parties.I got invited by pretending to be media.
