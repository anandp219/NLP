  I made the decision that ended up being unfortunate for this man and his family. But you can tell me if you think I made the right decision or not. We were pitching the US Post Office on a big project. It could've been a million dollar project or more. Which was big for my small company. Everyone worked late Friday. Everyone worked Saturday and Sunday. The project proposal got finished. Relief! I handed to X. "Send this to them as fast as possible." So he used Federal Express. To the US Post Office.
