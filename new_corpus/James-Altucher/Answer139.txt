Did it even get me that first job? No. I failed the interview miserably. I knew the answers to none of the questions. What got me the job was this: After the interviews I was depressed. I went into the part right outside of work and there were people playing chess. I played one of the guys in chess. He's now a well-known poker player. I beat him. When I looked up  my boss's boss's boss (the one who gave me the toughest interview) was there. It turned out he was a very good amateur chess player. "I never saw anyone beat Ylon before" he told me.
