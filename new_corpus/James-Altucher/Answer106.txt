-----"We don't have as many managers as we should  but we would rather have too few than too many. "The 20th century was the century of middle-class corporatism. It even became a "law" called "The Peter Principle" - everyone rises to their level of incompetence. One of the problems society is having now is that the entire middle layer of management is being demoted  outsourced  replaced by technology  and fired. This is not a bad or a good thing (although it's scary). But it's a return to the role of masters and apprentices without bureaucracy and paperwork in the middle.
