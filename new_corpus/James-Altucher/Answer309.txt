I played a lot of poker. I began investing in companies. A million here. A few hundred thousand there.Then I started more companies. Then I bought more things. Then I became an addict. The worst kind of addict.From June 2000 until September  2001 I probably lost $1 million a month.I couldnt stop. I wanted to get back up to the peak.I wanted to be loved. I wanted to have $100 million so people would love me.Writing this now I even feel like slitting my wrists and stomach. I have 2 kids.I felt like I was going to die.
