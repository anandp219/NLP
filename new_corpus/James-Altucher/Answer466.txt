"They are so deluded  that each one of them thinks they are important and have a purpose in life. "They are just a bunch of skin jobs". Much later  one of the robot masters  Ridley Scott  used that same phrase in the movie "Bladerunner". ---Then they give us the ability to make other little "tubbies". I like calling little things "tubbies". When I first had a new little tubby around I thought she was very annoying. She was like a new roommate that would cry and not speak English and want food all the time and vomit on me.
