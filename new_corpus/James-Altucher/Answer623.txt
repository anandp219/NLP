None of my other books came close to making back their advances.On my first five self-published books I dont have all the numbers but I gave an enormous number of books away for free in order to build up my readership. Almost all of those books I produced for free but my revenues were minimal even though I had many readers for them.In the first week Choose Yourself! was out I got onto the WSJ Bestsellers List with about 10 000 copies sold. To hit the New York Times bestseller list I can tell you anecdotally (and it depends on the week) that you need about 2500  3000 copies sold in your first week.
