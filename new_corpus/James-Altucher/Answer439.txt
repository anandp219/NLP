He had a full time job the entire time.On his ninth novel (ninth! )  "WOOL"  a lot of people liked it. So he wrote "WOOL 2"  then "WOOL 3"  then "WOOL 4"  then the "WOOL Omnibus" that collected them all. Soon his books were all in the top ten for science fiction on Amazon. Now everyone was reading his books! And people were reading his back books. He had done zero marketing. Doing that one thing a day proved to be the BEST marketing. This is what many people don't get. So he wrote more: "Dust"  "Shift"  "Sand"  and more.
