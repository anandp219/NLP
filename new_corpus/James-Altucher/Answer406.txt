A gym. And you couldnt give those apartments away. So  of course  I moved in. Directly outside my window: the world famous New York Stock Exchange. A huge flag lit up at night  projecting its negative shadow straight through my apartment. You couldnt find a more depressed group of people than the ones going to work every day at the New York Stock Exchange. But I loved living there. I felt like I was part of history. That maybe this would be a new start for me. I looked out my window and there was the New York Stock Exchange.
