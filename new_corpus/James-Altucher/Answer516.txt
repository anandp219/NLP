Unless Im at optimal health in every way I constantly feel like I have less than nothing. Its post-traumatic stress from losing everything several times and watching my father lose everything twenty years earlier.No toys will ever patch that bleeding.The country now has a scarcity complex. The banks took everything. The government took everything. There are no jobs. There is no money. Everyone is in despair. Everyone is scared about feeding their family. Scared and scarred.
