You might be wrong. Who knows?Love is when you love the other people who love them.Love is when you see who they are. Not when you see who you want them to be.Love is when youre afraid to lose them  but you dont try and keep them.When theres drama  Love is when you both wrote the script together.Love is when they are upset and tell you and you count to two before you respond  Youre right.You love them when you keep yourself clean and you sleep well and eat well.Love is when you forgot to tell them something all the time.Love is when you cant sleep and are feeling sick and anxious and its 3am  but you reach out and touch them and now you are feeling a little better.SURPRISE!Love is when they are sick and theres nothing you can do so you listen to them.Love is when they want to do something and you dont  so you dont and everyone feels good about it.Love is when you just think laugh  and they start to laugh.You love them when you can still love yourself.This isnt a list of what you SHOULD do when you are in love.
