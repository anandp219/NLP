I don't hate them  I hate the feeling I get when I don't understand something.It's like this itch on my back that I can't quite reach.If I'm curious about something  I'll ask. Some interviewees (Wayne Dyer) if you just hit "Go" he'll talk for an hour. But I get curious about almost everything he says.I want my life to be better so I need to understand everything. And if I think he's missing something or skipping something because he's speaking at level I don't understand  then I stop him until I understand.If you are afraid to be curious for fear of offending them or interrupting too much then there is no point in doing the interview.As an example  when Coolio mentioned he broke his cocaine habit  I was really curious.
