He lives it.It doesnt matter if you are Jewish on the holiest day of the year. It doesnt matter if you are an atheist. It doesnt matter if you are Christian  or Catholic.Pope Francis lives a message. I wish every day I could try to live closer to that same message.K) HIS NAME IS HIS ENTIRE BELIEF SYSTEMHe chose the name Francis when he became Pope because of Francis of Assisi. How come?He explains:Francis of Assisi loved  helped and served the needy  the sick and the poor; he also cared greatly for creation.To me  this is the entire belief system of Pope Francis.
