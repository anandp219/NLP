And stop using the word failure. Blah!Here are better things to learn from. Failure has many cousins. Learn from one of the cousins:- CURIOSITY: When something happens and you dont understand why  then ask  Why?Keep asking questions. Clearly  something confusing happened. Ask and ask and ask.Guess what will happen: you will get answers. - EXPERIMENT: Sometimes people say Thomas Edison failed 999 times before he finally came up with the lightbulb on the 1000th try.This is a total lie. It is normal in a lab to experiment with many many materials before coming up with the right one.Oh!
