I was grateful for my daughters. I was grateful for what I had. I didnt fight reality or regret. This was my reality and I had to make the best of it. Every day I came up with ideas for new businesses. I had a waiters pad. I would go to a cafe at 6 in the morning with about 4 books and read for an hour or two and then start writing down ideas for new businesses  articles  etc. I started a hedge fund. I started a fund of hedge funds. I started a newsletter. I did deals. I made introductions every day  expanding my brand new network from scratch.
