  In 2003 I really disliked Warren Buffett. Like  I personally hated him. After 9/11 he stated Were going to have something in the way of a major nuclear event in this country. It will happen. Whether it will happen in 10 years or 10 minutes  or 50 years  its virtually a certainty.Everyone on TV nodded their head. Why not. The man is bigger than Jesus. But listen  WB (we call each other by our initials when we whisper softly to each other) charges for insurance AGAINST NUCLEAR ATTACKS. If I were a door to door life insurance salesman you know what I would say to you?
