So there's got to be a reason we put up with all this punishment. The first time I kissed a woman  I couldn't believe it. My lips touched the top of her lips  then the bottom of her pout. Then I found her  then I found me  and under a torn and desperate moon  I found a single moment of pleasure. It was wonderful. But I wondered  is this where the passion is? Because there are many of these moments  both good and bad  where inspiration might strike us. But at some point  they all meld together. And 10 years out I look back and I say  "that seems like yesterday".
