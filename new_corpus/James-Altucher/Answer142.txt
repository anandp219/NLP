By the end of my three years in college (I graduated a year earlier thanks to summer classes because I wanted to save money) I had gotten trashed many times and had tried marijuana and LSD. 3) For the last time in your life you continue to make friends who are your exact same age and demographics. When I was 19  my friends were 19. When I was 20  my friends were 20. Now I'm 47. My friends range in age from 24 to 84  all different nationalities and sexual preferences  etc. This is real life. College is just extended high school.
