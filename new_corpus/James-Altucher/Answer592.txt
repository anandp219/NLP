Im going on a word diet. 2500 words a day. MAX. I might not succeed (its an experiment) but Im hoping I learn more today. And tomorrow. Listening is a form of giving credit. It means you value the words of other. Listening is a form of integrity. Because everyone offers something  you acknowledge that. Listening is a form of improving relationships with others. Listening is a way to outsource good ideas since if you let many others talk  some of them will give you good ideas you might not have thought of.
