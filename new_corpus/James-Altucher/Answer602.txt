BUT  two tips: write 500-2000 words every day to keep exercising the writing muscle. And read good writers every day. Then you will write an even better book.A typical book is anywhere from 40 000-80 000 words. So if you can average 1000 words a day  seven days a week  you can write four to eight books a year. Or one very very good  edited  revised  professional one. Or ten! Knock yourself out!I also wanted a high quality foreword for the book. I was really grateful that Dick Costolo  CEO of Twitter  agreed to do mine.
