Chocolate encourages people to take risks and makes people happy.Chocolate makes people feel like they are in love. And willing to take risks.All of the traders walking into the exchange were depressed. They were all looking at the ground.I started to approach with my chocolates. At first the guards stood up and gripped their guns. Dogs were barking.But then I handed out chocolates. Traders would look up  smile  and take the chocolate. Nobody refused me.And yes  that day was the bottom of the market.
