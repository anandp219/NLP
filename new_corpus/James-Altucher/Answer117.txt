That's not the point The point is: Values before Money.A business is a group of people with a goal to solve a problem. Values might be: we want to solve a problem  we want the customer to be happy  we want employees to feel like they have upward mobility  etc. Once you lose your values  you'll lost the money as well. This why family-run businesses often die by the third generation ("Shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations). The values of the founder got diluted through his descendants until the company failed.
