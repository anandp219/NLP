  Six years ago I was so depressed I thought I would kill myself. I had nothing going on in my life. And the girl I was dating kept calling me "crazy"  would break up with me every day  and refuse to introduce me to her friends. I had three failed businesses that year and the year before. And I was going to go broke with two kids to support. This past year  one of my investments sold for 4000% of my initial investment. A business I started went from $0 in revenues to $12 000 000 in eight months.
