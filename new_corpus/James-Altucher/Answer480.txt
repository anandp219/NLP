It would be nice to cut it down. Here are my two ideas on this  which I've applied in my life. First off  you don't need to be the best in the world to be better than everyone around you. The learning curve is steep but the final 10-20% is very flat. That's why it takes young tennis players a few years to get in the top 200 or the top 1000 but then it takes them another 10 years of hard work to be in the top 10. In the ENTIRE WORLD. So if you take 1000 hours. You'll be better than just about everyone you can possibly imagine encountering.
