I have minimal material possessions. If you know me youd see I dress like crap and the edges of all of my pants are frayed. I dont own a suit. I dont have a drivers license so fancy cars are out. I like comic books more than paintings. I dont like to fly or sail. And I dont drink wine or eat out a lot. So what did it mean for me back then: DNA. I finally felt good enough about myself to pass on my genes and have children. I never wanted to have children before that. Theres apparently some evolutionary reason that we feel a strong urge to pass on our genes.
