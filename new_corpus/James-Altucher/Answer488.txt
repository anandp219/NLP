And then I was able to crawl out of my cave. 19. HygieneI was talking to Tucker Max and Dr. Geoff Miller  THE smartest evolutionary psychologist on the planet. They said that many people ("mostly men") fail because they don't clean themselves. Tucker said to me  "James  just go to a hair salon  throw down 200 bucks  and tell them to make you look good." (I'm fine with how I look actually). I don't think I'll do that. But showering  brushing teeth a few times a day  changing clothes  cutting finger nails  washing face...all of this seems obvious.
