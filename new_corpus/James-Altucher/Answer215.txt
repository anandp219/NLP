Here's what I have to do: - I have to golf a lot- I have to take lessons from a pro- I have to take video of myself golfing and have the pro go over with me every stroke I did WRONG. - I have to practice those strokes over and over again. As Bruce Lee says  I don't fear the man who practices 10 000 kicks  I fear the man who practices 1 kick 10 000 times. - I have play competitive golf. When you play something competitively you learn the emotional psychology of how to deal with the adrenaline and tension that comes with playing with the grownups.
