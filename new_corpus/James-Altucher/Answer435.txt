One thing a day not only adds up  it compounds: - you have the one thing- you learn from creating one thing. That learning makes the next "one thing" better. - once you have a lot of "one things"  each markets the other. - You learn new tricks. I had never used Vine before  for instance. - Without the pressure of everything else  your "one thing" gets your full focus and energy. This doesn't mean the other things don't get done. I still make calls to people I want to. I still talk to people or write stuff or do podcasts or take care of business and hang out with Claudia or my kids.
