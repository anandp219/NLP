That's my ideal.Like anyone  the people I'm interviewing have problems in their lives. I like to hear those problems and offer my two cents  whether they help or not. I want to make someone think without coming across as annoying.This is very difficult. But if I'm listening close enough to what they are saying I can hear the small sorrows and successes that are in the spaces between words. That is often where the real interview takes place.E) CURIOSITYI hate when someone says something I don't understand.
