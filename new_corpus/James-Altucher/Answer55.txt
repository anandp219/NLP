"Don't drag the interview out hoping for more gems than might exist there.When it's over  leave. Hopefully at the end you have a new friend and you've learned many new things and have had a fun time and will make people laugh and give people value.The best interview is when all the equipment is off  you take a deep breath  and you realize that in the past hour your life just got a little bit better.
