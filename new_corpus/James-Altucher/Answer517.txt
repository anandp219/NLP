These are the monsters in the closet at night.Im tired of monsters in my closet. Anger wont change anything. Complaining wont change anything.I want to be consistently in the 1%. Not of money. Money comes and goes  talking of Michelangelo.I want to be in the 1% of the happiest people on Earth.My only goal is to be in the 1% of happiness. Else  if Im in the 99%  then all of my other goals will also fall short of the 1%. You cant meet the love of your life  for instance  if youre in the botton 99%.
