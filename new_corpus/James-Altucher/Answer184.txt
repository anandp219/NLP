On the other column is the list of FIRST STEPS. Remember  only the first step. Because you have no idea where that first step will take you.Imagine you are driving 100 miles to your home late at night. You turn on your headlights so you can see in front of you. All you can see is about 30 feet in front of you but you know if you have the lights on the entire time  youll make it home safely  100 miles away.Activating the idea machine is how you turn the lights on so you can get home. But you dont need to do any more than that.One of my favorite examples: Richard Branson didnt like the service on some airline he was flying.
