Now EVERY television channel is basically all reality all the time  or at least 50% of the time.My real problem was: I didnt have confidence. And I didnt know what the next step was. In retrospect  I shouldve written down my idea  written down ten ideas for possible shows to launch with  and started pitching TV companies to get someone to partner with me on it. That wouldve been simple and not taken too much time before there was some payoff.Note: what might be too big for you (thinking of the next step) might not be too big for someone else (they might easily know  and not be afriad of  what the next step is).Quick example:I was first asked a similar question a few months ago and I replied that an idea would be too big if you cant think of the next step.
