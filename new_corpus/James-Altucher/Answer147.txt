Maybe even starting a business? Who knows?Many other well-known software companies started by 19 or 20 year olds started that way. What if I had done it? Instead I had to wait 5 years before even considering it because i was using the most valuable time in my life to take classes that taught me nothing. I'm not bitter (see the Pros) but I often wonder what would have been different. What if you are not a scientist? Doesn't matter. My daughter wants to study acting. Why can't she just spend that time going to auditions and getting real roles.
