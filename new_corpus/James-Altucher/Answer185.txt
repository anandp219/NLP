So he had an idea: Im going to start a new airline. How the heck can a magazine publisher start an airline from scratch with no money?His first step. He called Boeing to see if they had an airplane he could lease.No idea is so big you cant take the first step. If the first step seems to hard  make it simpler. And dont worry again if the idea is bad. This is all practice.For instance  lets say one of my ideas is: I want to be a brain surgeon. My first step: I would buy a bunch of books on how to do brain surgery.
