I bet there are some Manga artists who even have videos on how to do it.She says  but thats copying. I dont want to copy. I refuse.So I tell her my favorite quote from Picasso  Good artists copy. Great artists steal. And my oldest says  that would mean HE stole. And I tell her thats right but still my youngest refuses to listen. She says  I dont want to copy. I want to do something completely original.But thats impossible. Just about every idea worked on now is a result of the following recursive formula:NI(X) = NI(1) + NI(2 )+ NI(3) + MIWhere NI = new idea and NI1  NI2  etc equals various new ideas as of yesterday.
