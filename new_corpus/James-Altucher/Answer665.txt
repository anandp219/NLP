It's worked for me many times now. Also  if someone falls off the scorecard  it gives me a chance to distance myself while still having them in the pool of the source. This all sounds very clinical. Ugh. Like science. But I do wear a lab coat when I write. So I am Dr. Love. C) SELECTYou have a SCORECARD and a SOURCE. But not everyone in the source will fit what you want in your life. There's only so many "openings" to fill. You can't have a room filled with great friends and lovers every day. Maybe there's only room for one lover.
