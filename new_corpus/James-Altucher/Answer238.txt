When I was trading for Victor Neiderhoffer I saw that he had collected just about every finance book from 1800 on. So I started reading books anywhere from 100 to 30 years old just to see what people were thinking and how finance and trading had evolved.One book  Supermoney was by the pseudonymous Adam Smith detailing random adventures he had as a reporter in finance in the late 60s  early 70s. On one adventure he decided to visit a retired investor (the book was written around 1972) who was trying to figure out what to do with the rest of his life now that he had $20 million after shutting down his hedge fund.
