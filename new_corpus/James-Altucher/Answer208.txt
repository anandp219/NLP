Then the whistle blows  the race begins  I try my hardest with the most amount of integrity  and the results are not up to me.Then I go back and learn from the race  I prepare more  I love more  I celebrate more  and I shop up for the next race. The whistle blows  and eventually good things happen. Preparation leads to Faith in yourself.I used to think good things never happen. I saw my father die without anything good happening to him. I thought my fate was going to parallel his. But every moment  this moment while you are reading this  you get to choose abundance  gratitude  kindness  integrity  goodness.
