Cheating on my wife would make me unhappily married. BAM! That would put me in the 99%.F) I try to be as grateful as possible. When I remind someone what theyve done for me and how happy it made me it not only brings back memories of that happiness it also makes me happy that Im helping them be happy by being grateful for them.G) I try to surrender. I say to myself  I cant do everything. I cant take this pain. I cant have everything I want. Sometimes Im helpless in the face of my material goals.
