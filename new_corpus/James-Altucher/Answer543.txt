You can't solve a person's problems by giving them money (although that sometimes is a solution). We are all constantly trying to tell our story. We wear masks  put on appearances  dance the dance. The gap occurs when the story we tell is different from the story we are trying to tell. The story of who we are inside. The one who listens is the one who can figure out that story. This is the first step at communicating to that baby child inside that wants to come out and play. C) QUESTIONSWithout the right question  you'll never get the right answer.
