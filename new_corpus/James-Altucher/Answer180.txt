You are putting too much pressure on yourself. Perfectionism is the ENEMY of the idea muscle. Perfectionism is your brain trying to protect you from harm. From coming up with an idea that is embarassing and stupid and could cause you to suffer pain.We like the brain. But you have to shut the brain off to come up with ideas.The way you shut the brain off is by forcing it to come up with bad ideas.So lets say youve written 5 ideas for books and they are all pretty good. And now you are stuck. How can I top this brilliant list of five!
