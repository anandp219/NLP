So somehow it wasnt working.So I picked ten titles that I liked  combined them with the cover and created Facebook ads that I sent out to all my friends and friends of friends in the US. Then I sat back and watched the click-thrus. After a few days and thousands of click-thrus I had my title.The Choose Yourself Era came in a distant 3rd place. Pick Yourself! was right above it in second place. And Choose Yourself! came in first by far.I then took the same Facebook approach to pick the subtitle and the final version of the cover.9) Marketing.
