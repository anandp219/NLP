7) Factotum by Bukowski. Again  the beauty of the small chapter on an otherwise totally boring topic. Also  he was a poet first and I think people who read this book often miss the self-awareness that comes cloaked inside his ego. 8) Ant Farm. Simon Rich is funny. Funny is good. 9) A Million Little Pieces. Call him a fraud. Call him whatever. But I like the way James Frey breaks the rules in this book. It's a book about breaking the rules in writing. 10) Steps by Jerzy Kosinski. Short chapters. Each one gets intense quickly.
