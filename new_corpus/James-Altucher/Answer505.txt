Nothing you cant at least attempt.On a much smaller scale I can state a few examples of my own but Ill stick with one. I had an idea to create a financial news site that didnt have any news but was just a site made up of various methods to come up with investment ideas. In particular  by piggybacking the investment ideas of the greatest investors. I spec-ed out the site the morning I had the idea  I put the spec on Freelancer  several developers contacted me with prices  and I hired one of them.
