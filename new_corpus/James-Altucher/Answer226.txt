I love when this happens. You can argue Thomas Pynchon and James Joyce do that also but I guess I might not like their personalities as much. 16) Tiny Beautiful Things by Cheryl Strayed. She invents the genre of literary compassion. I reread from this book before every Q&A I do. This is just a few. I just realized I can probably write 100 down. But these are particular to me. I'm going to keep writing my 100 (in fact  I have a book club where I do exactly that). But you should try writing your 100.
