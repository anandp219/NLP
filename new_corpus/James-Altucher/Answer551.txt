I'm not really good at most things that people consider valuable skills. I'm shy and like to sit in my room and I'm afraid to meet new people. But I force myself to because I think  "this will take me out of my comfort zone." And then I will have something new to say. Then I can maybe help someone. Then I will have an answer to the only question that is ever important. At the end of the night  when the lights are out  when there's nothing left to say or do or think  to just wonder  even if there is no answer: "Who did I help today?"
