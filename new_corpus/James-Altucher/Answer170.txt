Not so that they can come up with great ideas right this second (although maybe you will) but so that people can come up with ideas when they need them: when their car is stuck  when their house blows up  when they are fired from their job  when their spouse betrays them  when they go bankrupt or lose a big customer  or lose a client  or go out of business  or get sick.IDEAS ARE THE CURRENCY OF LIFE. Not money. Money gets depleted until you go broke. But good ideas buy you good experiences  buy you better ideas  buy you better experiences  buy you more time  save your life.
