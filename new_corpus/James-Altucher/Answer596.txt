Publishing a book is not just putting your thoughts on a blog post. Its an event. It shows your best curated thoughts and it shows customers  clients  investors  friends  and lovers  what are the most important things on your mind right now.Unfortunately  most people suck at it. Ive largely sucked at it. Ive published 11 books  5 with traditional publishers  and six that are self-published.The distinction now is no longer between traditional publishing versus self-publishing. The disctinction now is between PROFESSIONAL versus UNPROFESSIONAL publishing.
