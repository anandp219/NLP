Nils and I went back and forth on over 15 different rewrites for my book. The difference between the original version and the final version is like the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.And yes  publishers have editors. Some very good ones. But I specifically wanted to choose my own editor and use an editor that has worked on books that have sold millions of copies. The entire idea of Publishing 3.0 is that I am not limited to who is on the publishers staff but I can pick the absolute best people in the industry.
