I was also going broke in the stock market and losing my home (until I personally saved the entire stock market  see my book).Every night  Id have waffles for dinner and a bottle of wine and start writing ideas down. This is before I went paleo (no waffles!) and stopped drinking alcohol (five years sober!) and I was writing 10-20 of the most ludicrous ideas a day down.And you know what ? It worked.B) HOW DO I START EXERCISING THE IDEA MUSCLE?Take a waiters pad.
