I tried this in my life. I used to make a lot of phone calls each day to find out how different businesses I was invested in were doing. Now I make 0 phone calls. Result: nothing really changed.Occasionally someone would call me and ask for advice (the 1%) and value would result (the 50%) but it gave me back a huge chunk of my life. HUGE. And I'm much happier. And pretty much I get the same results. Nobody really wanted to talk to me anyway. 9. No News. This is really a subset of the 1/50 rule above.
