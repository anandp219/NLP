So we were going to meet in a bookstore near the train station and then go to her place and she would cook. I was late. She remembered I mentioned that even though my last book was about investing  it had a lot of personal stuff written in it. So she went looking for my book  hoping they would have some. Not suprisingly  they had not sold a single one of my books in the prior six months. They had about eight of them there. The same number that was there six months earlier when I was signing the books next to my six year old.
