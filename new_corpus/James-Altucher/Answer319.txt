what do you feel strongly about?I said  nothing.He said thats a strong response. Dont you worry about death?I said  Why waste any part of today worrying about something that will happen later?Today Pope Francis arrives at St. Patricks in NYC. My guess is his motives will be loftier than mine. But I dont know. Maybe he wants money also.So I did some research. God or not  religion or not  Catholic or not  I try to learn from everyone.Heres what I love about Pope Francis on this holiest of Jewish holidays  Yom Kippur.
