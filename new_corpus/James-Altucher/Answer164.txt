  The way to have good ideas is to get close to killing yourself. Its like weightlifting. When you lift slightly more than you can handle  you get stronger.In life  when the gun is to your head  you either figure it out  or you die.When you cut yourself open  you bleed ideas. If youre broke and close to death  you have to start coming up with ideas.If you destroy your life  you need to come up with ideas to rebuild it.The only time Ive been FORCED to have good ideas is when I was up against the wall.
