I don't care at all about their process for hiring. I'm glad it works for them. Good luck. When I read their book  I realized I used their process in personal relationships! Wife  friends  work friends  close ties  weak ties  etc. So here it is. A) SCORECARDList all the features you want for a particular relationship. Like  for a wife: I want someone who doesn't cheat. For a friend  I want someone who doesn't lie to me. I make a list of ten things for each "position". When I was first dating after I got divorced I did not have a scorecard.So I met women who were interested in all sorts of things that had no interest for me.
