IRM (Iron Mountain). In the past ten years  the US has multiplied by ten the regulatory requirements of corporate America. Im not saying this is good or bad. I dont really care. But I do care about making money from it. IRM provides all storage management for companies: paper  digital  etc. And yeilds 3.7%. Theyve raised dividends for at least 10 years in a row and have also been buying back shares. (I asked a cab driver to take me by his house. Just a simple house on a corner of a suburban block).
