Now that same average person makes $33 000. This is taken right out of tax data. And yet  student loans have gone up from almost nothing to $1.4 trillion. If you are 25  have a great idea that can change the world  and want to start a company  how will you do it if now you have to be chained to a cubicle to pay back your debt? You can't even declare bankruptcy to get rid of your debt. With one hand  the government feeds you to the slaughterhouse (college) and with the other  they seize all of your assets.
