the homeowner might spend close to $1 000 000 in the lifespan of the house. Or twice that.So instead of writing that $200 000 check in one day (as opposed to spreading rent out over eight years and the landlord is in charge of all maintenance  taxes  etc so you dont have to deal with it)  you could invest in yourself.Can you get more than 0.2% a year investing in yourself?I hope so. Simple example: If you take two or three courses in a month on WordPress development  you can take freelance jobs making $5000 a month.I know 14 year olds doing that.
