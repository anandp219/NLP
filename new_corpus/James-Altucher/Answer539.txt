I wandered off of my path and ended up on the crowded death path.At every fork in the road you have a choice. This is what I try to do now: I ask  which choice makes me feel better.Then I dont think about it. Thoughts are too biased by evolution  society  our past  our neuroses. My only job is to ask the question.Then I take a breath. Maybe more. Whats my heart say? Whats my stomach say? Eventually  if Im healthy in other ways  my body will tell me the answer. (maybe this sounds corny  but its what I do).The public is not in YOUR business.
