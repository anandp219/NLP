There is no right or wrong. There is only learning. There is no order. There is only ever-expanding chaos. There is no karma. We are temporarily conscious tape recorders and then the tape is stored in data banks for later use. I like my mission. I like spending my days learning on behalf of the larger consciousness that I am not only a part of  but it is a part of me - since there is no difference. Only our ego thinks there is a difference  but that is part of the learning. Whether good things or bad things happen to the creature that think it is "me"  I don't care.
