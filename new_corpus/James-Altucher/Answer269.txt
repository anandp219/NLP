Sometimes when I wake her I think she's about to confess that it's both. I didn't mean for that first sentence to sound dramatic. But before you can find passion  you have to live. You have to say  I WANT to live. Life is very hard. We're born and a moment later  the connection to all of our happiness that we've ever experienced in the womb is cut by scissors. And then we are slapped hard by the doctor. Wake up! We're hit and slapped and burned by cigarettes all over our bodies over and over again until the day we die.
