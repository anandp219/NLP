So he puts the tea in the ink and starts his drawing.Funny  I thought. He combines the things he loves. But then he went further.He said he imagined his fathers hand was on his when he drew  and that he loved his father.And that all his ancestors hands were on his when he drew. And all his students hands and all the people he knew.He showed a drawing of a circle. He said that the circle was made out of smiles.He didnt say do what you love. But he showed that if you love something  heres how you do it.You pour all of your love into it.
