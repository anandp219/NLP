He started out dirt poor  an orphan coming out of foster homes. He went to school  got his PhD  became a professor  and was so loved by his students he reached tenure by age 35  in 1975. Do you know what tenure is? It means the school has to pay you for the rest of your life. It means you never have to worry about a job or money again. You're set. So what did he do then? He quit.He had written a book "Your Erroneous Zones" and it failed in his eyes. It had sold 5000 copies. When a book sells 5000 copies the publisher typically wipes their hands clean (they have made a tidy profit) and says  "Ok  on to the next one."
