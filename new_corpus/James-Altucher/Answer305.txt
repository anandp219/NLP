Remember the character in the movie who walks in a room and instantly hits the guy who is about to slash him from behind? That guy doesn't exist in the real world. In the real world  we don't have skills. Nobody does. Remove your skills. In good writing  remove people's ability to deal with the world around them. Life is hard. The universe has been around 14 billion years and we've only been around 10-90. Don't think you can fight the tidal wave of atoms that swarm over our destinies. Constantly remove skills from everyone to make your writing better.
