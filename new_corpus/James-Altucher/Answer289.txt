Sometimes I can go a week without laughing. Responsibilties  fear  loneliness  anxiety  regret  can weigh me down. I didn't have those as a kid. I try to laugh. I try to find things that make me align. As an adult you have to practice being a kid  letting that child peek out again. He or she wants to come out and play and see the world again. What's changed? The child wants to know!But guess what? The adults know. I have experience now. I've had the pills in the mouth. I've been divorced and lost two houses and lost a family.
