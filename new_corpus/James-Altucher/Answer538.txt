He kept his comedy clean when nobody else was. He created a show about nothing when every other show was about something.And he went out at the top when $100 000 000 was being offered to him and everyone was begging for more.Its hard to do that. We have needs. We have bills to pay. If everyone is doing it this way then maybe this way is the right way? Its scary.So we often do things we dont really want to do. Other people  or societal myths  make our decisions. And much later  at least with me  I would start feeling stuck or depressed.
