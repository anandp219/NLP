do the job that editors used to do (example: Maxwell Perkins in the 1930s) but have been sorely lacking in the past 20 years from traditional publishers. Nils has previously edited bestsellers from Tucker Max  Kamal Ravikant  Ryan Holiday  and a dozen writers as well as written screenplays  books  etc.I am not saying hire Nils by the way. Im just saying this is who I used (and paid). Make sure who you use is among the best in the world. Else you arent taking advantage of what the Publishing 3.0 world has to offer.
