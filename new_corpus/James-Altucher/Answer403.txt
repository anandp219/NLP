  Well  read my writing. Why would I make that up? I was living on 40 Wall St. I was watching the traders go in and out of the exchange super-depressed. It was 2009. People were literally killing themselves at least once a day on my block. I wanted to do something about it. Nothing in the book is made up at all. So why would I make up that section. That section is almost stranger than fiction  which the truth often is. Hold on one second. I'm going to try to find the section and cut and paste it here so you don't even have to get the book to try and read it...one minute.....finding....OK.
