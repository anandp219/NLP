Only good things.My dad failed. He had a company that went bankrupt. He went broke.Then he got depressed. He couldnt stop thinking about the failure.Then he got sick. He was always sick. Because his body broke down from obsessing on the failure.Then he got a stroke. Depression + stress + sick = stroke. Then he never recovered and for two years he never moved and could only blink.Then he died.Ive started a lot of businesses. Some worked. Some didnt. Over a period of many many years. MANY.I hope Ive solved a lot of hard problems.
