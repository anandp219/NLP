The key is that it has to be ten or more.You want your brain to sweat.You want your brain to hurt to come up with more and more ideas. One possibility right now is to list ten ideas that are too big for me and what the next steps might be. For instance  one idea might be launch solar panels into outerspace to more efficiently generate solar power. Another idea might be  genetically engineer a microbe that sucks the salt out of water. I have no idea if thats even possible. Another idea might be  within one year I am going to write a book and give away a million copies for free.The first step would be to write the book.
