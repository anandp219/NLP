I got a special badge. One guy had some numbers written on a napkin. What do you think Berkshires intrinsic value is? he asked me. He had all the parts of Berkshire written on a napkin with numbers written next to them. If you didnt know it  this is referred to as back of the napkin investing.I met another guy who told me a story. He bought 200 shares of Berkshire in 1976. The shares doubled in a year or so and he got nervous. So he sold 100 shares and used the proceeds to start a restaurant. The other 100 shares (assuming he still holds them because he told me he was never going to sell them) are now worth $18 000 000.
