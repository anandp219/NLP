When you sleep  BAM! Your brain is re-energized and you have new energy that can last you an entire day. There is a ton of research on this. For instance  the average professional violinist sleeps 8.6 hours a day. I've worked with people who tell me they only need three hours a day. Then they also tell me they are bipolar. If you are too busy to sleep 8 hours a day then find micro-habits you can stop so you can sleep more Else you will die earlier. Like...don't watch TV at night. Get blackout drapes.
