The essence of creativity is to take rules and figure out the way to break each rule so that it benefits you. I am an expert on what it takes to not be successful. Before I can give you the rules I must establish my credentials  which date back to six years old but after 10 000 hours of being a failure I have had my peak moments around 2002 and 2010 and maybe some at 2004 and 2005. and perhaps 2008. And a few failures around 1991 and 1994. I have started about 20 businesses and failed at 17 of them.
