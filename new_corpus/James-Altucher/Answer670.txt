That you are not the Emperor who wears no clothes. That your word is gold.That you don't gossip about others (because then you might gossip later about them).That you don't take things personally when you shouldn't (I often do that  and when I do - I'm very hard to deal with as Claudia tells me). So you show  through time  that you are the person they want to be around. My favorite technique. I always try to "over promise and over deliver". When I'm doing anything: a talk  an event  a book  a post  a trip  lending a helping hand  I always ask myself  "am I over promising and over delivering".
