That wasn't good enough. He didn't want a publisher to choose whether he was a success or not. He quit his 100% safe job. Everyone said he was crazy and begged him not to. He bought out the rest of the inventory of books from his publisher and put them in the trunk of his station wagon.With his nine year old daughter sitting next to him he drove all over the country  from bookstore to bookstore  begging them to take his books. You choose yourself one choice at a time. You choose yourself every day.
