On Createspace the royalty given my pricing was about 26%.The total cost of everything described above was $31 000  not counting traveling I did for the marketing and other marketing costs involved in building my platform.Related posts:33 Unusual Tips to Being a Better Writer Why and How I Self-Published a Book
