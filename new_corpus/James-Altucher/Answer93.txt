Even US Steel  which built every building in the country for an entire century  has gone bankrupt. Never let the practical get in the way of the possible. It's practical to focus on what you can do right now. But give yourself time in your life to wonder what is possible and to make even the slightest moves in that direction. We're at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change  we're still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think a lot of that is because of the negativity... Every story I read is Google vs someone else.
