  Most non-fiction books are bad. And sometimes that's a great thing. It's because the writer spent his life getting GOOD at what he was writing about. He didn't spend his life being good at writing. He didn't spend his life typing. He ran a country. Or built a robot. Or discovered DNA or walked between the twin towers. He or She DID something. Something that changed lives. Something that went from his or her head out into the real world. I like reading billion-person books. Books  that if read widely  would change a billion lives.
