  This is like magic. Thank you. Finally a question made for me. I don't even need a belt to fit this question around my waist. First  I have some credentials. I've failed at 17 businesses. I've succeeded at a few. But failed at most. I've also run a $125 million venture capital firm and I'm currently invested in about 30 companies  many of which I advise or on the board  etc. Oh  one thing before I answer the question: the companies that NEVER call me are always the ones that are doing the best.
