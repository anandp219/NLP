Before I met the woman who is now my wife. Am I the only person who is not successful at so many things? Maybe. Yes  maybe. But I also have had a few successes. So I know both sides of the story  as they say. And so I will give my rules. What worked for me when I was a success. And what failed for me as well. HERE IS WHAT FAILURES DO:1) They believe in the word failure.We dont live long enough to fail. Like if a planet is around for 4 billion years and produces no life-forms  I would call that planet a failure.
