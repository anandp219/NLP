My goal was not to necessarily make the most money but to make sure the message got out to as many people as possible.On the very first page of the book  before the editorial information and dedication  there is the offer.I offer to pay people back for the book if they could prove to me they both bought it and read it. Then I would pay them back completely for the book (losing money on each transaction because of the cut Amazon takes plus shipping). The idea was: I would be happy to give the book for free  but I know people dont value things they get for free.
