In fact  there are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name. "Our parents have our best interests at heart and tell us how to be good adults. Our schools have our best interests. Our friends  colleagues  sometimes our bosses  sometimes government  think they have our best interests. But it's only when everyone thinks you are crazy that you know you are going to create something that surprises everyone and really makes your own unique handprint on the world. And because you went out of the comfort zone  you're only competing against the few other people as crazy as you are.
