The days are bolted together by a stapler called "routine". What happened to those moments: my mom screaming my name though the neighborhood  my friends ignoring the parents  we were all on two or three piles of rocks on construction sites we were strictly forbidden from playing near. We were throwing rocks at each other. Because one side was Saturn and the other side was Jupiter and they were at war. Occasionally one of us would time travel and teleport to the other side. And the rock throwing would go in a different direction.There's no north and south in space.
