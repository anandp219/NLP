  I found my passion the moment I had a bottle full of pills in my mouth and I had the choice whether to swallow them or not. I had carefully researched what would do the trick. But I was worried if I swallowed the pills then the insurance companies wouldn't pay my kids $4 million in life insurance. They have a funny thing about being judgmental on suicide. Suicide is a horrible thing for kids. I know this because my wife's mother killed herself. Sometimes I hear Claudia crying in her sleep. It's either because she's married to me or it's because of her mother.
