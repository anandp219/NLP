I don't want to be an orphan just so I can write about it. You either have drama in your life or in your writing. It's very hard to have drama in both. You should experience something: passion for what you want to write about. If you have a lot of experience being President of the United States then you can probably transcribe that and make a book. Or if you think that eventually we will colonize Mars and then have a war with the robots we left behind on Earth then you can probably write a novel.
