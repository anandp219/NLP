People don't like people who TELL them.D) STORIESWhen my daughters were real little they wouldn't go to sleep until I told them a story about when I was a kid. I had to tell them a new story every day. They didn't want a lecture on why you shouldn't steal. They wanted to know about the time I stole and got caught. Between you and me there is a vast river. A story is a boat. An idea is a passenger on that boat. Only when you put the idea in the boat and send it in the right direction  when the wind is blowing just so  and the weather is the right temperature  does it have a chance of reaching the other side.
