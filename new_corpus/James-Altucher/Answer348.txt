They called us the next day (10am delivery) and said  "are you kidding?" They said  "You used FedEx to pitch the US Post Office?" We could've come up with something smart to say  "Hey  that's why you have to improve your branding." But we didn't and that would not have worked anyway. You don't FedEx the US Post Office on a million dollar project. This guy wasn't an intern. He was an employee for five years and just had his first kid. I had to fire him. Not because he made a dumb error. Not because he was a bad guy.
