It is to let a shaft of light break through the heavy clouds; it is to bring the warmth of hope!J) LIVE BY EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF PREACHINGImagine youve had a hard day at your construction site. You finally get a break  sit down with your friends  and break out your lunch.A man walks by. Hes tired also from his job. He leaves the crowd surrounding him and asks you and your friends if he can join you for lunch.He pulls out his lunchbox also and starts eating and talking to you.He lives in a simple studio  drives a simple car  and refuses all gifts anyone gives him.Hes the Pope and this happened.Quote: These two criteria are like the pillars of true love: deeds  and the gift of self.He doesnt just say it.
