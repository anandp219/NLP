So YOU figure it out. I dont even know who Im talking to. Who YOU is. I might be talking to my teddy bear when I say that.But having a sense of surrender and humility will help me reduce my needs (I dont need a yacht for instance) and help me to feel humility. Theres a physical exercise thats good to practice surrender if you are not good at it. In America were not really good at surrender. We never give up. We want to win every war. The exercise is to reach down and touch your toes. It obscures your vision (because you are staring at your knees)  its almost impossible (you have to be flexible  both physically and mentally)  and it looks like your bowing  which is an unusual thing for Americans to do.
