Just like some houses are bad and some are good  some landlords are better than others. Like anything that is an important life decision  it takes research.You can find roots with a good landlord. You can even paint the house and knock down walls and do whatever you want.If you believe in housing as an investment  there are companies that just own houses that you can invest in on the stock market.So you get all the benefits of a long-term investment in housing and get your cash out in five seconds if you need it.But what should you do with all of that extra cash you have if you dont own a house?Maybe nothing.
