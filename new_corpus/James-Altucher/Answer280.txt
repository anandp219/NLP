Marie Curie wondered. She wondered about it until it killed her. Why did Opera make Mozart tingle despite the acclaim he was receiving from the blander concertos popular at the time. Why do children ask why and when you answer they ask why again  and then again. When you take a subway in NYC it says "mind the gap". It's in the gaps of adults talking that you have to catch yourself and ask "Why?" "We just got divorced and then I moved to NYC " says one man to the other. "Why?" is what I always wonder.
