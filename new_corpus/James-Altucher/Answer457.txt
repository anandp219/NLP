And then  they also  will feel less need for roots.That is the best investment. That is the best return on investment. That is the best home to live in.The America Dream has us chained us to the land so they can feed us like pigs in a trough with debt  with factory/cubicle jobs that we cant escape because its so hard to move (until they kick us out with 2 weeks severance)  with forced friends in our neighbors  with supposed roots for our kids even though the statistics show those roots are a lie.Freedom is more important than a dream.Everyone has the story.
