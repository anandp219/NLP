Theres thousands of flowers and plants and it smells like dirt.To be honest  thats the closest I will ever get to hiking  sitting in the garden area of Home Depot.Im pathetic. And I flush my rent down the toilet. And I dont have roots. And I refuse to fix my toilets or shovel my driveway or deal with my flooded basement. All I like to do is read.And one day Ill move. Maybe next to an ocean. And take a walk on the beach. Last week  a friend told me the sun sets in the West.Maybe one day Ill move to California.
