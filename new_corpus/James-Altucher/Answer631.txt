"I'm a bad person " it might tell me at three in the morning. It might torture me until I cry. How did I end up here?It might remind me of all the times I was fired. I could see all of their faces. Every boss firing me in anger: Bryan  Erik  Jim  Victor  etc. BAD! Or precisely 30 years to the day before I die it might remind me of that urgent email to something-something we have to return OR ELSE. Or why did I say X at the dinner? Now everyone will think I'm boring. Or even worse - irrelevant. I'm horrible at group dinners.
