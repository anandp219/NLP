1% a day. The problem with this meta-habit is that it's not noticeable. If I want to get 1% a day better at baseball it's almost impossible to notice. Nothing might change from day to day  as far as I can tell. So you have to be gentle on ourself. And just have the mindset that the goal is improvement  not a number. Just 1% a day improvement. You can also choose to decrease 1% a day. That's what most people do. Ahh  I can't write today  so I'm going to read the news and eat junk food. One day won't matter.
