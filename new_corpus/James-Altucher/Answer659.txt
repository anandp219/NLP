Women who were interested in dating other guys at the same time. Women who were more focused on my belongings than who I was. Women who liked me but wanted to see what else was better. Women who wanted me to dress a certain way  or even women who wanted me to like having ten cats in my house and five babies. I have nothing against any of these people. One woman I really liked once got super drunk at a party I invited her to. I have nothing against that. But then her breasts fell out of her dress and she never noticed.
