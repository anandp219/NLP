So different there is no way I couldve predicted the differences.Six months ago I had no podcast. Now its a big part of my day. Six months before that  Choose Yourself had not come out. Six months before that  several I had not yet gone on several board seats that have done well for me. And so on.Q) DO I GIVE MY IDEAS AWAY FOR FREE?When you come up with ideas for someone else  always give ALL the ideas away for free if you think they are good ideas (remember: six months).I read recently one person said to give HALF of your ideas away for free and make them pay for the other half.This is very bad.
