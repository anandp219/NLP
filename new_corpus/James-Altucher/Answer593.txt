Buddha didnt start a major religion by talking. It started because he sat under a tree and listened. Jesus spent 40 days in a desert. Listening. Moses listened to his wife (err.I mean a burning bush). Everything that has moved history happened because of listening instead of talking. Talking inspires. But listening creates the inspiration. I can say break all of the above rules is the final rule. But Im not going to say that. You know why? Because this is not bullshit. This is not about how to fail or to succeed.
