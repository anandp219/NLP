I'd be on these panels and they'd tell us when to argue with each other. I'd be sitting in a dark room in the studio with a camera facing me and an earpiece in my ear and ever now and then a voice would say  "Ok  argue now!" And we all had to be perfect. Nobody was allowed to say  "I don't know". I was always so scared because I never knew.
