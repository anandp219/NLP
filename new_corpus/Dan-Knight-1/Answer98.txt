It covers the city in a noxious shroud  it covers buildings  it strangles trees and your lungs. Noise. There will always be an abundance of noise  group people together and theres all sorts of noise. Peace and quiet maybe hard to come by  but like manure  my brain will filter it out over time.People. Because there is a higher concentration of people  theres a higher concentration of weird people - the kind of people you probably wouldnt want to meet your mother. Theres also more homeless people vying for your attention.
