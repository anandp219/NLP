Stinausin had caused Luseferous enormous military and political difficulties before being defeated  difficulties which sometimes verged on being humiliations. There was deep resentment towards the traitor  which easily turned to anger when Luseferous looked upon the mans face  no matter how battered  bruised and bloody it might be (the heads augmented healing functions were quick  but not instantaneous)  and so the Archimandrite probably still smashed away at Stinausins head with as much enthusiasm now as he had when he first hung there  years earlier.
