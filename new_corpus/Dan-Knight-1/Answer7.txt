  AnonymousWho Am I? Just another guy in the crowdAnother bag of blood and bones sat beneath the cloudsJust another son of a mother and a father  done proudJust another mind uncomfortably cradling self doubt.Im just another daydreamer Another inbetweenerNeither here nor thereAnother person in the queueAnother pair of feet  a pair of socks  a pair of shoes.Im just a name and number on a cardIm just another bit of skin  worn in and slightly scarredIm just another set of eyes staring at the starsAnother smileAnother laughAnother beating heart.Im just another ex sending you a drunken textJust another person on that long list of your regretsAnother silly bugger with mounting debtsJust another face that by the morning youll forget.
