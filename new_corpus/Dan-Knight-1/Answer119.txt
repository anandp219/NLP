  Oh brilliant. Here are all these superior  literate people who can read a million books a year at a billion words a second with a vocabulary of a million billion.I must read oh... Two books a year. I really really enjoy reading  it's my favourite pastime. In fact  I read pretty much every night and therein lies the problem. I manage to read a few pages and then the pressing need for sleep takes over. To commemorate the death of Terry Pratchett  I've decided to read all the Discworld books missing from my TP library - this is from The Wee Free Men onwards.
