Theres a huge swathe of acreage with little to no internet access  let alone phone reception. To get anywhere or do anything you need transport. Bus fares mount up  petrol/diesel/car maintenance is expensive. Taxis are ridiculous. Getting stranded is a real problem. With heavy rain or snow youre likely to get cut off for days at a time. With preparation  this doesnt have to be too much of a problem. Without preparation it could be potentially life threatening.Amenities close early. Its a Sunday evening and youve run out of coriander  better go to the sho Oh no wait a minute  it closes at 4pm.
