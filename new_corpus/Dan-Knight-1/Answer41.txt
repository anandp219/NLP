It's not until you look a little closer that you see the photo is made up of screenshots from Trumans life. This is called a photo mosaic and it was the first time I'd see that effect.The Memory Thief (2007)"Lukas (Mark Webber) is a lost soul who will create a world that will push him over the edge in "The Memory Thief." A Christian  he immerses himself in the Holocaust and adopts the persona of a survivor of the camps. But instead of finding his own humanity  Lukas  a toll taker who on the surface has a good heart - he gives his neighbors rent money  he cares for his comatose mother  he rescues a dog - becomes obsessed with  and makes a perversion of  the survivor's memories.
