Speaking in 2008  she says "I started covering things in paint  from trees to blades of grass. I wanted to reference what was directly beneath the paint  and capture the shadows dripping on the landscape." From there she moved on to painting Human subjects  as you can see  this is where she had the most impact: Alexa is currently working on a couple of tech collaborations playing with augmented reality as well as virtual reality. She's creating some tessellating shape tiles as a design toy that helps build spatial intelligence.To view more of her photos  please have a look at her website: http://www.alexameade.com/
