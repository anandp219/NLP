Cheese will leave your pizza soggy and oily whilst at the same time killing the taste. A popular pizza I make is a Pianta:Arrabbiata sauce on the base (passata  chilli flakes  parsley and garlic oil)ArtichokesChestnut MushroomsPine NutsBlack OlivesFinished with: Rocket and Olive OilSimple  but oh so tasty. 2) Cut a hole in the middle of the pizza and fill it with salad mix. Less dough  healthy and nutritious (although I always prefer a little dressing).3) Reroll the dough. For this technique you need some overproven dough: Its now more than double in size  it maybe starting to smell like old beer (thats the yeast fermenting the dough) and looking slightly discoloured.
