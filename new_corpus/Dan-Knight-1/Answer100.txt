Restaurants are typically more expensive  shopping is more expensive (without research)  pubs and bars are more expensive etc.Crime. More people  more crime. This is a simple fact of city living. I mean  of course  theres crime in the rural communities  but there are fewer criminal gangs. CCTV and a police presence go some way to help control the gangs  but crime is still going to happen regardless.To conclude  at 32 years of age  I've had my fill of (semi) rural life. The cost of living vs wages problem has had a profound effect on my growing up.
