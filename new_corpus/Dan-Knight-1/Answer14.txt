Caffeine was (and still is) my friend. Things are a little easier now because he doesnt mind reading or playing  even if its just for a little while. That half an hour of extra solace is a blessing. It amuses me when I know he will turn into that odious beast known as a teenager who will sleep long into the afternoon. Then it will be my turn to wake him up. Maybe Ill tickle his feet (no chance) or bounce on his stomach (asking for trouble)  or perhaps as my mum did to me: vacuum - sorry  there was a speck of dust I really needed to dispose of.
