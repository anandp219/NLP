I understand people are hungry or just interested in what youre doing  but anyone would feel distracted when they look up to see ten+ pairs of eyes trained on their every move. The kitchen is set towards the back of the room  so its my prerogative to check incoming and outgoing customers for effective time/team management. Its really easy for people to think youre looking at them  when in fact you just want to Get. Stuff. Done.The music is humdrum. Music has always been a staple of a kitchen environment (except for when its busy).
