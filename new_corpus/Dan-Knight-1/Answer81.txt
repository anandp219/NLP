Odd how people reacted so severely to something unpleasant happening right in front of them but were prepared to ignore much worse horrors taking place elsewhere. He is calculating and truly maliciously evil. I cant think of a villain who would go to such degradation just for his own malevolent gratification. He is pompous  over-the-top and unbelievable in his callous audacity. Not bad for just being a man.
