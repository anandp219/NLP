And wait. And wait until you need the toilet because thats the only time it would ring. It took effort to find someone. Meeting potential life partners usually meant going to a local bar or club (meat markets) or through a friend of a friend. A meat market person didnt usually end up being too deep and meaningful. Dating a friend of a friend was based around a convoluted routine:1) Let your friends know you fancy her/him. They would tell them and find out if they fancy you.2) Start meeting the object of your affections at social  crowded gatherings and make prolonged eye contact followed by maybe even talking (probably about the weather).3) Acquire their phone number and hang out by the landline in anticipation of a prolonged chat (usually including the weather).4) Start by holding hands  after a week get off/snog one another in full view of everyone.
