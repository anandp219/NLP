  I am an avid fan of Nicola Bertellotti  an Italian photographer who travels across Europe to capture the beautiful decay of crumbling ruins. Chambre Du CommerceHe's travelled from Poland to Belgium to Switzerland to his home country of Italy and everywhere in-between to photograph what he calls poetry marked by abandonment. Tomb Of The SithUnfortunately  he cant disclose the precise whereabouts of some of his shooting locations as there is a lot of competition between photographers. Some will purposely exaggerate the desolation of a scene to orchestrate more impact in a composition.
