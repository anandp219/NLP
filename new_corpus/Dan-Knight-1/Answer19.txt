The biproducts from this are carbon dioxide and alcohol. The alcohol evaporates and the carbon dioxide creates holes which provides airpockets and gives the dough a nice and light texture.Try using a little passata with only a couple of high quality ingredients such a santos tomatoes with buffalo mozzarella  green or red pesto with some fresh basil and a little garlic oil  cracked black pepper and oregano to season. Keeping it simple will ensure the different taste combinations are complimenting instead of cancelling eachother out.
