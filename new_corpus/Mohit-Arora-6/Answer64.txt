James Gandolfini  as a mafia boss in New Jersey  did an amazing job as an actor. Also  the soundtrack of this serial is amazing. Even the side characters did an amazing job. Edie Falco and Michael Imperioli brought life to the serial. I would say "The Sopranos" is the best drama ever aired on the TV (even better than The Wire and Breaking Bad)3. Breaking Bad - This is all about Bryan Cranston. The character development of Cranston from a high school chemistry teacher to a drug lord is amazingly portrayed in this serial.
