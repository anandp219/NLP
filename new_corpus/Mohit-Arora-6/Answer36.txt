They used to reply to my comments sincerely and without taking any offence. I have observed that it is changing with time. Recently  I got some pretty rude comments on my content and I had no idea what should I comment as a reply to them (I am not going to take names here). I don't understand why people find it difficult to digest the fact that different people can have different perspectives.Sometimes I feel like some people do it just because they get a kick from it. They love trolling. They love when people swear at them but actually cannot do any harm to them.
