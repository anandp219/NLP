Most of these suggestions are established writers who already have a lot of followers and have written hundreds of answers. Rarely  a new budding writer makes the cut. So the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer.2. Popularity bias - No matter how much you deny it  in your heart you have to agree that when there are two answers written for a question  one of them from a Quora celebrity and another one from someone unknown  you will probably just read the first answer and even if you don't like it wholeheartedly you will still upvote it because you know that the person  overall  is a good writer.
