  It all depends on what you want to do in your life or what you are passionate about. Since you had to ask a question on Quora  I think you are already confused.First of all  do you have an absolute passion for coding? Do you want to make a difference in the world with your coding skills? If yes  then go for masters and after that go for a PhD. You have got a very good rank in GATE so you should get a top IIT  if not IISc. Trust me  this will give a real boost to your knowledge of coding and computers in general.
