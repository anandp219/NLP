In fact  with a masters degree  you will reach a managerial position much faster than your bachelor counterparts. But again  if money is the only motivation  you would get enough of it even at a second-to-manager position. There is no need to waste 2 years of your life for this.So just be sure what you want. Neither of the above options are bad. Even though the Indian youth is inclined towards getting a masters degree and then may be go for a PhD  there are a lot of people who just love working in startups or MNCs and live a comfortable life with the earnings.Just be sure what gives you the inner satisfaction and go for it.
