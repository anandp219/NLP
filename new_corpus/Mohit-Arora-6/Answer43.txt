  It all depends on how mentally strong you are.First scenario - You wait for the good job and do not get depressed when people around you are getting placed. When that job opportunity arrives  give your 100%. If you get in  well and good. If you didn't  you can think that you were already going for an off campus job so it doesn't matter much. But this is the difficult and uncertain path. What if that "good job opportunity" didn't show up? Companies do not commit. They visit campuses based on their current requirements.
