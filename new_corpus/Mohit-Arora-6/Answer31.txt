  I can provide my subjective opinion here.Carrie's character was never an emotional one. It is clear from the epilogue of season 3 finale that after four months of Tehran incident Carrie moved on in her life and was pretty excited about the opportunity to work as a station chief in Istanbul. Apparently  she didn't feel "love" for her own baby. For Carrie  it has always been about her job and her career. The only person she ever got emotionally attached with was Brody and probably because of that attachment she decided to keep his baby.Now about the incident.
