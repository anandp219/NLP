While talking to the PD she might have mentioned that Mike is also here. So they came by. She also might have thought that mentioning the money and her thoughts about her husband's character might also help the PD to look for the murderers.While talking to Mike she said "Yeah  I called them to help catch Matty's killers. What if the same person who got Matty  got them too?". This indicates that she called them when she heard about the shooting of the two cops and knowing about the money was not the main reason to call the PD.
