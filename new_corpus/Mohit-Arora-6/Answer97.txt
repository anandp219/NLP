  Thanks for the A2A  but this question is not significant anymore. Earlier this year (2015)  Quora had pulled off the role of Moderators on their website.Now there are "trusted reporters" on Quora instead of moderators. All the people who were moderators are by default trusted reporters and they have most of the powers that they used to have when they were moderators. One plus to this arrangement is that now anyone can become a trusted reporter. If a normal user constantly report bad stuff and most of their reports are genuine then they might also become a trusted reporter and will have the power to collapse answers right away.Even though the answers reported by trusted reporters get collapsed right away  they are still sent to the reviewing queue of admins  and admins have to power to revert the operation of a trusted reporter.One difference is that moderators used to have the power to lock and delete questions but trusted reporters do not have this power.
