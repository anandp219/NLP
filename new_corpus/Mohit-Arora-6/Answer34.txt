And the stories people tell him surprises me. They open up with him and share their darkest secrets  their embarrassing mistakes and their beautiful romance. They allow him to write all those things on his page and he does. The most amazing thing is the response from the users in terms of the comments. I have never seen such a supportive crowd anywhere on the internet. Sometimes I read the stories and I feel like people must have written all the crap in their comments because that's what people do on the internet but with this page  it is exactly the opposite.Same does not go with a lot of other pages I follow on Facebook.
