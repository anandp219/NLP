  I think it came from the Chechen mobsters as a reminder of what happens to people who screw with them. Bob gave the crucial piece of information to the police that one of the robbers was wearing a broken watch which was stopped at 6:15. I think Chovka (Chechen mobster) had connections in the police department and he got to know about this broken watch thing from them. When Chovka came to see Bob and Marv the next day  he already had that one robber in his car bleeding to death. Even though they didn't show his face (or the watch)  he was probably the same robber who robbed Marv's bar.May be Chovka had his doubts about Marv or Bob because the robbers knew that Marv's bar was going to be the "drop" bar.
