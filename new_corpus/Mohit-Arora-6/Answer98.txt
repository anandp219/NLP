Trusted reporters' power is pretty much confined to just the answers written on Quora. But yes  their reports carry significant weight and given higher priority than a normal user's reports.Moderators used to have a separate dashboard which showed the number of answers and topics that need to be reviewed. It also showed the statistics of other moderators  i.e  how many topics and answers top 5 moderators have reviewed in a particular month.
