He killed "Glory Days" and when it was too much  he even put a bullet in Deeds' head. But he did that only when it was too much for him to tolerate.He was also a loyal person. He was not a rat like Marv (it may be wrong to call Marv a rat because he probably did it out of frustration of losing his bar and income to Chechen mobsters).Marv knew all these things about Bob. He knew that Bob would never agree to be a part of his "plan" and he could have even tried to stop Marv from doing such a thing.
