She didn't care on emotional level. She told Quinn  "The worst case scenario is that it was a real wedding but who do you think will come forward and witness that? No one." (not her exact words  but close.) Not once she showed any sign of regret or guilt or dejection. She was more worried about her job because now she and the embassy need to give an explanation to the foreign minister about what happened in Pakistan.She was obviously troubled because she acted on a half cooked information and now have to take all the heat but I highly doubt that she was stirred on emotional level.
