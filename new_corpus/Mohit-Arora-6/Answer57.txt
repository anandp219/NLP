Employee stock plan - Also know as ESPP. Adobe let its employees purchase Adobe's stocks every six months by setting aside up to 25% of their payroll. The price at the start and the end of six months is noted and stocks are given at 15% percent discount on whatever price is less. So you are definitely gonna get a profit of 15% even if the value of the shares goes down in those 6 months. The lock in price (which is set at the time of enrollment in ESPP) is valid for 24 months and hence this plan is very profitable in the long run.
