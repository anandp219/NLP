  To answer the question  she called them "after" finding the money. But finding the money was not the reason to call the cops.She told Mike that she found the money in the suitcase while unpacking. She obviously shifted to ABQ after Matty's death and while unpacking she found the money. She might not have given much thought to it then  as she was grieving. Or even though she might have found this suspicious she might have decided not to think about it that much as her husband was already gone.The reason she called the cops was the death of Hoffman and Fensky.
