You are still supposed to scan your blind spot.Automated parallel parking / automated garage parking:I have not been able to get this feature to work. I've seen videos of it working  but I've never seen the parking indicator trigger.I'm probably doing something wrong.Also  the review mentioning that this worked in June is highly suspect - parallel parking only came out in version 7.0 and garage parking is still not out ( it's a 7.1 feature ).TLDR: Tesla Autopilot works extremely well on freeways  which is what it was designed to do.
