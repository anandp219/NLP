I use a Linux desktop and so this is important to me.I had more problems with Spotify and Bluetooth as compared to Google Play music. I did not diagnose why this was the case  and instead opted to go for the app which did work for me.Using Google Play Music also improves your YouTube and Google Now recommendations from what I can make out. I like how the subscription fee also disables ads for a lot of YouTube music.I have an Android tablet at home  and it's got slightly better voice integration as compared to Spotify  in terms of being able to say "play [song] by [artist] on Google Play Music".The fee is 8$  2$ less than Spotify  which is a nice to have  but not a key driver for me.I find the social aspect of Spotify creepy and distracting more so than helpful.
