  I ate at Sukiyabashi Jiro Roppongi about a month ago. A lot of the other answers have narrated the experience of dining there already  so I'll try to answer some of the questions around what makes it stand out from other sushi experiences.Was it the best sushi I ever had ?Yes  but there is some fine print  so read on.Was it worth the 5X-6X cost multiplier of what you can get at Tsujki Market ?It's questionable. If you are optimizing absolute best quality rather than value for money yes  otherwise go stand in line at the fish market.
