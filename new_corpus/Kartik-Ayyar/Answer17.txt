  I was a former paying Spotify user and happy with it for a few years  but after trying out Google Play Music for a couple of months  I made the switch for the following reasons:The basics - streaming  offline support  recommendations  playlist management  content selection  multi platform support are all there in both products.Great support for Nexus Player and Chromecast. It's very nice for broadcasting music when at a friends place.A web interface which does not use Flash  has keyboard shortcuts and is much faster.
