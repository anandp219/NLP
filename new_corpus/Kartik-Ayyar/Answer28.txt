  While I love the rigor of great algorithms books and in particular Introduction to Algorithms  one general problem that I've found with algorithms textbooks as an industry practitioner is that they focus a lot on advanced in core data structures you don't use often  and not enough on persistent data structures ones that you use a lot.For in core data structures in most cases lists  arrays and hash tables are by far the most commonly used structures. Sure once in a while you might see a skip list here and there or learn a particular implementation relies on a particular balanced tree  but for the most part getting your hands dirty with complex in core structures is rare.On the other hand  persistent data structures one encounters are usually now far  far more demanding than anything you see in a textbook  and usually also far less explained.
