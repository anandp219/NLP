  I am going to tackle this A2A from a male-female perspective. Why  indeed  are obese women much more likely to attain a normal (non-obese) weight than obese men? After all  the deck seems stacked against us. Women naturally have a higher percentage body fat than men  and body fat burns fewer calories -- pound for pound -- than muscleEstrogen is also implicated in weight gainLoss of estrogen  in perimenopause and menopause  lowers the metabolism and also leads to weight gain. And women start gradually losing estrogen around the age of 30  with 51 being the average age of MenopausePregnancy almost always results in some level of post-partum obesity  so many women will spend at least part of their lives obeseWomen are also more likely to be poor (even temporarily)  and poverty is strongly correlated with obesityHowever  what women do have going for them is societal pressure to be thin  which generally starts in the teenage years.
