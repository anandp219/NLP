  I am going to be a contrarian and say it doesn't suck as much as calling from a list of contacts. Provided  of course  that you can cherry-pick your cold contacts  and are not strictly required to follow a script. When I was a teen  I worked a variety of pick-up jobs to supplement my regular income whenever possible. I liked sales because the money was generally better  per hour  than most jobs I was qualified for. (A high school student doesn't typically have too many choices when it comes to being hired  but if you can sell  you can get a job selling.
