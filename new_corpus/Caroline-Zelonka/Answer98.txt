  By hook or by crook  yes indeedy. I had such an awesome time at the past few Mountain View meetups that this one is on my can't miss list  especially since it looks like many new people (aka "friends I haven't met in person yet") will be there.However  I am not an East Coast gal. I know next to nothing about Manhattan and its environs  so I would appreciate any advice on places to stay that would be convenient and cheap  as well as airport recommendations. Due to temporary destitution  I will not be able to make my arrangements right away.
