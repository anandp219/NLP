The current Boomer population is considered by many as the Unhealthiest Generation -- as a group  they have greater medical needs than their parents did at their same age. And with advances in cardiovascular and cancer treatment (two of the biggest killers of older people)  Boomers are living longer lives despite their often-serious  chronic  and expensive medical conditions.National health care should be a priority for us  in part because Boomers will likely not be able to afford the care they will need.
