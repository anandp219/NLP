  "Scaring off the Bear"Like Tula in My Big Fat Greek Wedding  I have a huge family. Twenty-seven cousins  though one sadly passed away a few years ago. When I was a child  all but one lived in Canada  and we lived in Seattle. So practically every summer  our family of six would pack up the Mercury station wagon and tent trailer for an extended road trip to visit our many relatives  and also do some camping in the Canadian Rockies  where my dad grew up.Though we typically stayed at established campsites  the wilderness was right outside the door.
