Cyndi Perlman Fink  Marie Stein  Stephanie Vardavas  Charles Faraone and Garrick Saito are other users whom I consider among Quora's sages. For a young person  Ava Glass also gives some sage advice  and his recent life experience post have been riveting. Not to reduce anyone to joker status  but if you want a laugh or two  subscribe to Domhnall O'Huigin  Andrew Gutsch and Bianca N. DieselAnd love him or hate him (and I happen to love him)  you should also follow Leonard Kim  because his answers always seem to blow up.
