)Full disclosure: I only had 24 000 credits or so when it was announced  having given my entire wad to a brand-new user to thank her for a brilliant answer. (It was worth it  she was dancing on air.) But I think  at several points in my Quora history  that I hit the one million credit mark once or twice.But it was never about the credits. Millionairehood is a side effect of Quora addiction. If you spent as much time and energy on the site as I have over the same time frame (close to four years)  I daresay you might have been seeing a lot of zeroes in your account  too.
