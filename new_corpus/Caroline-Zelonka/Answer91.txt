  Facebook excels as a platform for announcing news. They don't call it a "news feed" for nothing. As such  it's ideal for announcing a death. I will vehemently disagree with anyone who says it's tacky or inappropriate. (It might be tacky to announce an acquaintance's death before an obituary is published  or the news is otherwise announced by the family  however. )It's up to you to post what you find appropriate. I would advise you to make it clear that the person actually died. We tend to use euphemisms to talk about illness  death etc.  but sometimes they're hard to interpret.I'd also think about phrasing the announcement so that a "like" is appropriate.
