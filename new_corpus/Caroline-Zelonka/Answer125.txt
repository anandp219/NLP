(Everyone needs to eat  and it's a lot more lucrative to write material that's selling something than it is to get readers to pay for your content). So it's not that hard to find dedicated writers for the native stuff. Many of them  again myself included  find pseudo-journalism more interesting than other forms of sales writing.
