In both cases  I also targeted wealthier towns and suburbs in certain cities  and after awhile  certain types of businesses that seemed receptive to my product and pitch.I didn't follow the provided scripts  though I used a large portion of information from them. And I probably played the "young student calling on behalf of my boss"card quite a bit to gain their trust  and possibly their payment information.So while telesales kind of sucked for me  as an introvert  making sales was very rewarding.
