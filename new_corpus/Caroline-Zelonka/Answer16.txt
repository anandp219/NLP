Freelancing for large companies is almost always better than startups  or heaven-knows  entrepreneurships or family-owned companies. Ideally  you'll want to find clients within marketing departments of large public companies like Qualcomm  Abbott  Johnson & Johnson (these are a few of my clients  all in the healthcare space but you get the idea).These projects will have bigger budgets  and you will not be getting paid out of the owner's pocket  so less griping when a project goes over budget or even on-budget.
