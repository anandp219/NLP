Don't talk about the rush experience in anything more than the most vague way. Whatever you do  do not critique the sorority's party theme or presentation -- good or bad. (It looks like fun  but it's a slog and a lot of the girls will be operating on little sleep and a lot of overwork).Be yourself. Don't try to fake an outgoing personality if you're quiet  or vice versa. The sorority is looking for all personality types  but chances are  if you come across as fake you won't do that well.Looks-wise  appearance matters  of course.
