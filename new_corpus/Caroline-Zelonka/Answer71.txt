  Dentists will schedule their days around different kinds of appointments  which can include general exams  cleanings and restorative work such as fillings  which may be what you mean when you say "drilling. "At the exam  they'll take a look at your teeth and the progression of any problems  hence the "teeth to watch" list. If a tooth does require attention  they will typically schedule that type of appointment separately. Even if it's something major -- like a cracked or abcessed tooth -- it can usually wait awhile.
