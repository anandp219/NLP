The native content may or may not be bylined. At our newspaper  we run bylined stuff that is more on the editorial side ("holiday shopping guide for the sports fan" or "10 brunch spots with the best bacon dishes")  and any particular advertiser does not get to choose whether it's featured  though we are sometimes encouraged to mention particular businesses  but never more direction than that. If it's directly featuring a product or service  then we don't byline it. It will say something like  "produced by The Seattle Times advertising department" that clearly denotes its paid nature.Though there are times when I do write more news-oriented content  it's usually for native advertising for the publisher.
