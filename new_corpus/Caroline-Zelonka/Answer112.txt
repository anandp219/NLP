I clean my own house (though I have to admit I recently hired someone else to ready it for a short-term tenant)  but I can hardly claim purity in any other area of consumption. I buy my jeans at shops which are reputed to subcontract to sweatshops. I tend to favour decorative objects no doubt ripped off from scantily paid Third World craftspersons. Like everyone else  I eat salad greens just picked by migrant farm workers  some of them possibly children. So why should housework - as I have found in conversations with liberal-minded employers of maids - arouse any special angst?
