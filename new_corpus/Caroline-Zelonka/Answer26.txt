  This is what I keep at the office:Workout clothes (yoga pants  tank top and socks). Maybe a swimsuit  if I'm planning on swimmingAt least one pair of athletic shoes  in case I want to go for a run (though I typically wear athletic shoes all day as part of my regular outfit)Flip-flops  in case I want to do an "office pedicure" (prepping my feet the day before  then applying the various layers of polish throughout the day). A great time and money saver  by the way.A few sweatshirts and jackets  to wear when they blast the fucking ACAnd finally  a wrap dress  necklace and dress shoes in case I need to dress up.
