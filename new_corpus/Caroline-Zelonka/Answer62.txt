It can be hard  but you can sleep with hunger pangs. The plus side is that you'll have a lot of food dreams  where you can gorge to your heart's delight and not ever get full. You will also have less trouble waking up  because you'll be eager to get breakfast. (Breakfast is very important  so don't skip that.) If you feel like incorporating nuts or dried fruits into your diet  breakfast is the best time to do so  because you'll be fueling your body for the activity ahead. But please  for the love of God  save the trail mix for the trail.
