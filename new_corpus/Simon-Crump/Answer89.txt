This may be because he has no strong feeling on the subject or it may be because his own personal views contrast with those of many of the people whose votes he covets. I imagine he doesn't want to dilute his message on inequality by alienating anyone over gun control. There is no clear or obvious link between left-wing economics and gun control. Sanders argues for one but not the other. Somebody else might disagree with him on both. That's OK.
