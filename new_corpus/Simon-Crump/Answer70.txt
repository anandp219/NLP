  The finance industry is responsible for recycling savings as investment.People with surplus wealth are inclined to save it. In a pre-capitalist society these savings had no useful purpose; their owners might buy art  treasure or spend the money on more castles. In a capitalist society  the banking and finance industry takes savings and lends them to entrepreneurs who require investment capital  thereby accepting much of the risk of doing so. You could think of this as a form of redistribution of wealth from those who have it (the wealthy) to those who have a use for it (entrepreneurs).
