Despite the name this is really just another income tax  although the number of years you have paid NI will be taken into account if you intend to retire in the UK.This is where things get complicated  because NI is not paid on company dividends. Historically  independent contractors have avoided NI by setting up limited companies and paying themselves a nominal wage  then distributing the rest of the earnings to themselves as dividends. This loophole was all but closed in 1999 via legislation known in the tax industry as IR35.However  there are still advantages for the employer (and in some cases the employee) of people being paid as sub-contractors  so the practice continues.
