Thatcher had strong support in that demographic in the eighties and the left/right paradigm is not important; it is more valuable to be seen as a conviction politician who stands up for their values whatever they may be. That was Farage's appeal and  in that sense  personalities are more important than policies when trying to win those votes back.
