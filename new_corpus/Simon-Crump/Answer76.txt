  Russia's objectives are fairly clear; support Assad's regime because he is a long-term ally and crush all the various rebellions. Western/American objectives are less clear. They don't like secular dictators like Assad and Saddam but they don't like theocratic revolutionaries either. They aspire to an idealistic scenario where democracy and Western freedoms can flourish  even though there are too few people in the region who actively pursue those values. They support rebels fighting against secular dictators right up until the point at which they become theocrats  then start looking for someone new to support.This brings Russia into conflict with the West because the West currently support the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and Russia does not.
