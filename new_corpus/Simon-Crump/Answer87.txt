  Not every policy debate can be framed in a simple left/right or liberal/conservative paradigm. A person's views on economics can exist independently from any views they might have about gun control  abortion  foreign policy or the death penalty.Unfortunately  these political realities are obscured in the United States because of its two-party system. Republicans are usually associated with a more liberal (in the original sense) approach to economics  along with opposition to gun control and abortion and an interventionist foreign policy  while Democrats tend to adopt the opposite position in those areas.
