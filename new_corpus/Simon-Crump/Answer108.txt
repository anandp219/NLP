  I'm sure Corbyn would consider capital controls to be completely unnecessary  but they would ultimately become inevitable under any government led by him.Corbyn imagines that he could fund all of his spending plans just by cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion. This is extremely naive. Tax rises would be necessary and naturally they would be targeted at the wealthiest. These tax rises would almost certainly raise no additional revenue because the extra received from those who were willing to pay would be cancelled out by those opting to take their money and leave.
