And maybe the next step would be to outlaw people carrying guns beyond the boundaries of their own property. At least then you would be in a position to arrest anyone on their way to school with a weapon. A gradual cultural change is required  in which Americans start to recognise the prevalence of guns in society as a threat rather than a safeguard.The most batshit-crazy idea I've heard is that school shootings could be prevented by arming teachers as a matter of course. All that does is increase the supply of guns in the classroom still further.
