You can't just get rid of all the guns in America because it was a frontier society until relatively recently in its history and there is still an ingrained culture of gun ownership which promotes guns as normal and healthy. There would be a messy revolt if you simply tried to outlaw all guns across the country tomorrow  but perhaps the big cities could be demilitarised first as they have tried to do in Chicago. There is no sound justification for people in densely populated urban areas to carry guns.
