  If Labour wants to lure back voters who deserted them for UKIP in 2015  they need to be honest with themselves about why it happened. It isn't sufficient to say that people voted for UKIP because Labour were perceived as Tory-lite  because in many ways UKIP are more Tory than the Tories themselves. Rather  erstwhile Labour supporters opted for UKIP because they were not part of the political establishment  and that is where Corbyn has some credentials of his own to offer. Although he has been in parliament since 1983 he is also known as a maverick  and he may be able to trade on that to woo disaffected voters.In terms of actual policy  the obvious principle that Corbyn personally shares with UKIP is opposition to the EU.
