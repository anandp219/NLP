  Personal taxation in the UK is low by Western European standards  but high compared to the US.The basic rate of income tax is 20%  but you do not pay anything on the first 10 600 that you earn in any given tax year. When your yearly annual earnings exceed 42 385 you pay 40% on whatever you earn over that amount. There is also a 45% band on income higher than 150k which was introduced as a "temporary measure" by the outgoing Labour government in 2010  but few crane operators would be affected by that.As well as income tax  UK employees are subject to national insurance (NI) at 12% on earnings over 155 per week  and 2% on earnings over 815 per week.
