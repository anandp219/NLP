Within the demographic in question  it is used in a similar  ostensibly self-deprecating (but actually celebratory) way to mock their own sense of entitlement and superiority.Example: It's awful  Cordelia was home from boarding school this weekend and she sprained her ankle getting out of the Range Rover after we'd been for tea at the Wolseley. Now I'm worried she won't be able to ski at Easter. Oh listen to me  how terribly middle class!
