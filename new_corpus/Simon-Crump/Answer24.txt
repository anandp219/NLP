Obviously  it tends to be colder in winter than in summer but the main difference is the length of the days. Days in December are depressingly short  whereas it doesn't get dark for long in mid-summer at all.All that said  my personal observation is that late September and early October is one of the most settled times of year. I would be more confident about organising an outdoor event then than in August  for example. The first days of October in Brighton are unlikely to be hot by anyone else's standard but you stand a fighting chance of them being at least fine and pleasant.
