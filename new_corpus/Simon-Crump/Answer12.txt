There are several problems with this.First  how many school shootings in America have been carried out by terrorists or criminal gangs  and how many were carried out by previously law-abiding citizens who did not have an existing criminal record or any reason to be under observation by the authorities? Professional criminals don't go around shooting up schools because it isn't good business; it doesn't provide them with an income stream and it attracts a lot of attention. And while terrorists have targeted schools in places like Nigeria  in the West they've historically preferred economic targets like the airline industry  railways and offices.
