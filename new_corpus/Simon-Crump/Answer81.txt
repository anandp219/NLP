  There are three main factions who want Britain out of the European Union  whom I shall glibly refer to as the xenophobes  the Little Englanders and the socialists. The xenophobes believe that Immigration is a major problem. As the EU guarantees freedom of movement  they see immigration from Eastern Europe in particular as a source of cheap labour who come to "take British jobs". They overlook the simple principle that more population equals higher demand  and that someone living in Britain while doing a decent job for a competitive wage is creating new opportunities for someone else.
