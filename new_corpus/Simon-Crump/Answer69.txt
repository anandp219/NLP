Their UK operation is entitled to assume responsibility for some of the expenses incurred by their US hub and they would seem to have engineered the accounts in this case in order to wipe out their taxable profit.Our legislators need to respond to this and figure out how to make it more difficult for multinationals like FB to export all their profit. There's no point whining about FB acting in their own interests because they have a duty to their shareholders to do so and it would be negligent of them to pay a penny more tax than our laws require them to.
