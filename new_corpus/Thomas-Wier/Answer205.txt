In linguistics  infinite refers to the fact that natural languages are syntactically recursive  meaning the rules can apply to their own output:This property of syntax leads to discrete infinity  since the set of such sentences is infinite (even though each of those individual sentences is itself of finite length).Thus  nonfinite and infinite are both technical terms that have different but important nonoverlapping meanings in linguistic theory because of the domain they apply to.
