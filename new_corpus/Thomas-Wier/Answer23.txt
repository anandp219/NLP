The implication for language is that Georgians will speak back to you in a language other than Georgian because they feel they can help you out  rather than respecting your personal choice to use Georgian. Explanation that this is not actually helpful for the Georgian language learner will be met with mystified looks  and they will usually carry on speaking English or Russian or some western language.Finally  most foreigners only come to Georgia after they are well past the critical period (roughly 12-17 years of age) when people can no longer easily acquire new languages -- the brain rewires itself after this point  making second-language acquisition harder.
