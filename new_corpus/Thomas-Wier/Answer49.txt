As with biological species  it is not sensible to ask when a particular language evolved  because all languages have evolved continuously for an equally long time from the first proto-language that came into being perhaps some quarter-million years ago (see my answer: When did language originate?). And indeed: this first proto-language harkens back to even earlier pre-linguistic forms of communication similar to those used by other species of ape. There has thus never been any one point in time when a given language categorically changed from Language A to Language B: linguistic change is not discrete like that.However  if we must compare the ages of writing and of speech  then something like the modern human language faculty has been in use for far  far longer than writing: 99% of the time speech has been around  writing has not.
