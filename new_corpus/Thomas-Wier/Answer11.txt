These two chains however are rather unlike each other  however  as the Lesser Caucasus mountain chain is over all less elevated  and tends to form discontinuous ridges without sharp increases in elevation. The same is not true of the southern slopes of the Greater Caucasus  which almost constitute a natural wall of rock all the way from subtropical Abkhazia in the west to the Iron Gates (Gates of Alexander) in Azerbaijan in the east. Here for example is an image of the plains of Kakheti in Georgia  just south of Daghestan in Georgia: The town of Sinai shown here is actually on one ridge on the other side of a wide valley about 20km from the mountains  which rise from about 700m above sea level very suddenly to about 3000-5000m above sealevel  and in most places are totally impassable except by foot or on horseback (and usually not even then).
