'Crucially  these exceptions constitute natural semantic and syntactic classes  so the subject-verb disagreement falls along predictable lines. What such examples illustrate is that the system of subject-verb agreement depends on specific facts in specific languages  and those facts can vary considerably from language to language; in some languages  subject-verb disagreement is not only allowed  it is obligatory in certain contexts. [1] In point of fact  agreement with the subject could be considered a kind of condition  but I will ignore that for purposes of this discussion.
