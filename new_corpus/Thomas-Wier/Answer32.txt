)As I mentioned elsewhere (Are there languages which in addition to the singular and plural  have a dual number? )  the 'empirical maximum' is probably found in the language Lihir of New Ireland  which has three persons  five numbers and a consistent inclusive/exclusive distinction for a total of 19:However  if we do include the other ancillary features that are found in pronouns  then surely the maximum would be found in the languages of Daghestan. To take Tabassaran as an example  each pronoun would be inflected for most of the 53 cases (in the northern dialects) and two numbers  and four or more genders  plus other relative  interrogative  and other demonstrative pronouns  and tacking on correlatives for good measure  the grand total would easily be above a thousand.
