The pronoun you historically was exclusively plural (the singular was thou); when thou disappeared and you filled its place  the reflexive form was originally generally yourselves  even when it had singular reference:As you can see in this chart  starting in the mid 18th century  you in its singular sense acquired a distinctly singular reflexive pronoun yourself (though this had actually been knocking around for a number of centuries  it was not generalized). Likewise  other pronouns like we sometimes had singular reference  and developed singular reflexive pronouns as a result.
