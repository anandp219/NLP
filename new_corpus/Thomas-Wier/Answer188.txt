However  as soon as it was put forth  it became immediately clear that this idea is wrong:We know enough about the history of some languages to show that alignment change is not unidirectional. For example  we know that Sanskrit is the ancestor of Hindi  and contrary to the theory  Sanskrit with an accusative alignment evolved into Hindi with a split-ergative alignment. This cannot be doubted  since we have actual texts of the language at most all stages of its evolution. A less certain example is Georgian: Proto-Kartvelian has been reconstructed with an ergative alignment  but modern Georgian has a active-stative alignment  also contrary to the stadialist hypothesis.A bigger problem is that we have reason to believe that human languages have been spoken for something like a quarter million to half a million years (see my answer When did language originate?).
