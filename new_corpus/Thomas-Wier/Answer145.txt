Although the Kartvelian languages have been situated in the Caucasus since time immemorial (at least the early Bronze Age)  the Ossetians arrived there in classical antiquity as an off-shoot of an eastern subbranch of the Iranian family within Indo-European -- Ossetian is specifically most closely related to Yaghnobi  a language spoken in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan. They are in fact the last remnants of the ancient Scythian nomads who roamed the western and central steppe more than two thousand years ago.
