  English is pretty tame when it comes to morphology. The oddest exceptions in forming plurals are hyperliterate Greco-Latin foreign loan words like octopodes [1]  rhinocerotes  and chrysalides  all of which have alternative (nonpretensious) Anglo-Saxon plurals. However  even these forms are actually not all that uncommon  since at least half the languages of the world indicate nominal plurals by suffixation: WALS map indicating pluralization strategies around the worldSome constructions that seem odd to speakers of European languages -- such as a separate word to indicate plurality -- are in fact not so rare either.
