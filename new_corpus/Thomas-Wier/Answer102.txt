  Depends on whether you want an 'answer' or the real answer. There are probably dozens of languages with one or fewer (yes  or fewer [1]) speakers left  but the problem comes in identifying them. For the most endangered languages often only very inexact information is available. Often by the time you hear that a language has one speaker left  the language has in fact died -- or on the contrary the people who speak it simply moved from one house to another. If you want an actual list  though  the Ethnologue is usually the best  most reliable source for linguistic demographic data: Ethnologue 15 report of nearly extinct languages.
