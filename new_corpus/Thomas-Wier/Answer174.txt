  Most of the other answers give one possible form of disagreement: when the features of the verb and the features of the subject fail to match in some recognized way. However  I'm going to argue here that this kind of disagreement is just a subtype of a more general phenomenon  and it sheds light on what agreement is doing in the first place.What is Agreement  anyway?First we have to unpack this rather complicated idea. Usually when you say that a verb agrees with the subject  you're saying that the form of the verb changes in response to some feature of the argument  such as person and number:The boy runs.In this sentence  the verb has a suffix -s that refers back to the argument of the sentence: boy.
