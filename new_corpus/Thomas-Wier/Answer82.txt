  This is really a huge question -- individual linguists have devoted their entire careers to examining how reflexivity works in natural languages because the subject is astonishingly complex. But because the question asks how reflexivity is 'shown'  I take it that what they're looking at is how reflexivity is formally encoded across languages. There are very generally speaking two different ways: the use of a special reflexive pronoun or noun  or the use of a special suffix on the verb to indicate coreference between the subject and an object.
