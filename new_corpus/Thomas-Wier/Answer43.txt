  These are two very different questions. For the first  there is a (somewhat) clear answer; for the second  there is no answer because the question relies on the false assumption that spoken languages can have a certain age.Writing is not just symbolism...The earliest form of (proto-)writing comes from Mesopotamia  and did not burst into existence full-fledged  but evolved over a period of many centuries from earlier forms of pictographic and symbolic communication systems. The best work on this was done by the art historian Denise Schmandt-Besserat  who showed in a series of engaging works that writing arose in Mesopotamia as a by-product of accounting systems.
