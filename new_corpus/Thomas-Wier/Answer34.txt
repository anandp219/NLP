Even in English  a word as basic as 'bad' has a poorly understood etymological pedigree.Inadequacy: using a historical explanation of where a word comes from often leads to a spurious understanding of how the word functions in today's language. Typology: we understand the histories of too few languages to have comparable understandings of widely divergent languages.That's all pretty abstract  so to give you a concrete example  both English and German have rather irregular verb forms for 'be' that children simply have to memorize:(1) English German I am we are ich bin wir sind you are you are du bist ihr seid he is they are er ist  sie sindNow here's the problem: although from a modern point of view all of these forms in both languages are irregular and unpredictable  from a historical point of view  the forms in bold (in both English and German) go back to one Proto-Indo-European verb root *es-  while the German forms that are italicized go back to a separate root *bheu-  which is also where English gets the infinitive form be.
