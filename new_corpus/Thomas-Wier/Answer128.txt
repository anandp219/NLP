  It turns out that many features of Indo-European languages of Europe  including English  are quite unusual in comparison to human languages generally -- but other IE languages are so normal that it's difficult to compare them. A few years back the Dutch linguist Michael Cysouw used the features described in the World Atlas of Language Structures to create a rarity index of the world's languages. The rarity index was mathematically formulated (see Cysouw's paper for more details [1]); if the mean rarity index of all languages found in WALS is 1.0  then languages with rarity indices of 2.0 or 3.0 are unusual  and languages with 8.0 or 10.0 are bizarre.
