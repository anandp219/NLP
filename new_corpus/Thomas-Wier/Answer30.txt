Later  the creation of a distinct 'Romanian' ethnolinguistic group arose because waves of Slavs  Hungarians  Turks and even Aryans (related to the Ossetians) invaded the Balkans and assimilated parts of the Romance-speaking world to their own languages  and cut them off from each other. Thus the Romanians are the remnant of a once much larger Eastern Romance linguistic sphere.There is another point to be made here though  and this is that when we say a language is a Germanic language or a Romance language  we are not talking about properties the language has today  but rather about the historical evolution of that language.
