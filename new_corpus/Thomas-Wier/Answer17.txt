For example  the verb 'to have' seems like it should be very basic  but you need to know that it takes a dative case subject that agrees with what look like object prefixes  a nominative case object that agree with subject suffixes  and you also need to know whether the possessee is animate or inanimate  because there are two entirely different verbs for 'have' that depend on that fact. Also  these two verbs use different irregular stems in every tense  so they require a lot of memorization.Although the last two centuries has seen a rush of western loan words  the vast majority of Georgian words are still pretty foreign-looking to westerners.
