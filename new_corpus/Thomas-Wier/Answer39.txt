Also  like the English example above  all of these roots  in both verbs  are historically related  even though they now are frozen in particular forms in particular parts of the paradigm. What this illustrates is irregularity is a feature of how cells in paradigms relate to each other  not features of particular roots.There is some evidence however that at least some of these suppletive roots are in fact not the same verb (sharing a paradigm) at all. An example from the chart above is the verb 'carry'  which has a dative-case subject in the present tense  but a nominative case subject in the future and a narrative case subject in the aorist past tense:(3) a.
