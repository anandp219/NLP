It also has three numbers: singular  dual and plural. The only pronouns that do not have common gender are logically enough the first and second persons -- people rarely talk to inanimate objects  and inanimate objects rarely speak up for themselves. (NB that the peculiar character ||' in the third person is a glottalized lateral click  an approximation of which you can hear pronouned here: Click consonant.) Korana is something of an outlier linguistically. However even Korana's system is not as unusual as those few languages which have gender only in the first or second person  and not the third.
