Some constructions however are truly unusual  such as systematically using tone to indicate noun plurals  which is found in the Sudanic language Ngiti:(1) Ngiti: kam chief  km chiefs mlyik angel mlyk angels mlim teacher mlm teachers addu my brother addu my brothersIn this language  a low tone on kam indicates a single chief  but if you raise the tone to a high tone  you get km 'chiefs'. Only two languages in WALS's survey of almost a thousand languages formed plurals in this way. Only slightly less rare is internal stem change  which is found in Maricopa  a language of California:(2) Maricopa: humar child  humaar children nchen older sibling nchiin older siblings hat dog haat dogs mhay boy mhaa boysAlthough both of these strategies are rare  they don't really strike you as 'strange' in the sense of counterintuitive.
