This is because some of the topography is not uniformly mountainous across the region: in some places the mountains form complicated alpine valleys for hundreds of kilometers in every direction  while in other places the mountains are effectively sheer walls that directly abut wide open plains and valleys. To see this  consider the following topographical map of the Caucasus:As you can see  the region is characterized not by one but two large chains of mountains which run roughly parallel to each other: the Lesser Caucasus mountain chain  which largely separates Georgian from Armenia and eastern Turkey; and the Greater Caucasus mountain chain  which separates Georgia and Azerbaijan from Circassia  North Ossetia  Ingushetia  Chechnya and Daghestan  among other regions in the southern Russian Federation.
