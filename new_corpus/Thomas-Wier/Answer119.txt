This form of English is so old that it is not even clear if we should call it English  since it was probably manufactured by someone in what is now Denmark and who emigrated to Britain at the very earliest period of Angl0-Saxon settlement around the year 450 or somewhat later. But of course  at this earliest period  there had been no time for Anglo-Saxon speech to diverge from the forms of speech in the 'old country' on the Continent. This is thus somewhat like the equivalent of finding an inscription on a tool that had been left behind by the Pilgrims on the Mayflower.
