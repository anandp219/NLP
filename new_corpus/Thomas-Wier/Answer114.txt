Among the Ngangikurrunggur (an aboriginal language of Australia)  nouns get divided into nine different genders depending on a combination of what marker they have on the noun (1)  how possessive adjectives are formed (2)  and what marker surfaces on adjectives (3):(source: Corbett  Gender  p. 140)As you can see  two of the nine genders are wholly dedicated to food sources  and several of the others also indirectly refer to food acquisition (weapons and tools help in food acquisition and processing  dogs help track down and seize prey).
