If you look at this map from the World Atlas of Language Structures  you will see that there is a typological cline from west to east in which the more westerly a language is spoken  the more likely that language is to have no evidence of ergativity: The distribution of languages with ergativity in full noun phrasesHere  you can see that the languages of western Eurasia and Africa have an almost exclusively neutral or nominative alignment in full NPs. As you proceed in an easterly direction  you get your first cluster of ergative languages in the Caucasus  then again in the Himalayas  then again quite a few across Melanesia and Australia  and again in the Pacific Northwest and the Amazon.Why would there be such a cline?
