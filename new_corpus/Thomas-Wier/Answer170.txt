  Definite articles like the mark noun phrases as identifiable to the reader/hearer. Contrary to some other answers here and what you may have learned in school  it is quite possible for definite noun phrases to be nonspecific  and even nonexistent (or in linguist's parlance  nonreferential). Both of these are at play in a sentence like "The unicorn is an imaginary animal". In that sentence  the use of the reflects an entire category of beast which  despite not referring to a specific instance of an animal  is assumed to be identifiable to the hearer (we all read or heard about unicorns as children  even though we've obviously never seen one).
