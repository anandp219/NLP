This is not proof that standard German is actually the source of the construction  but is suggestive. Here's a possible scenario:  the construction is introduced by non-Jewish Germans in the early to mid 19th century  most of whom move off inland to become farmers and small-town dwellers in the Midwest. Then  later  German Jews speaking Yiddish start arriving in the 1880s and 1890s  and they also use this construction in their English. However  the Yiddish-speaking Jews tend to stay in urban environments on the East Coast  unlike their gentile fellow German speakers.
