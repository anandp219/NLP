After the Communists secured power  they pursued policies in the Ukraine during collectivization that killed at least 3 and as many as 8 million people  mostly from a government-sponsored famine (Holodomor). Then  as Joseph Stalin gained ever more power  he engaged in a series of ever bloodier purges that killed some 700 thousand people during the Great Purge alone. Then  right when the Soviet Union was weak and disorganized because of the purges  Hitler invaded the Soviet Union  and Russia's entry into the Second World War left some 25-30 million people dead.
