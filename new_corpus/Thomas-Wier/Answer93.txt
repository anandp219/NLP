A class III word like l 'two apples' likewise has an inverse form lb 'one or three or more apples (but not two apples)'. A system like this one is really exceptionally rare  a true rarissimum of linguistic typology. [1] Octopus comes from Greek: okto 'eight' and pous 'foot'. Since the plural of pous is podes  the correct plural is octopodes. Octopi comes from mistaking the -us ending as a Latin second declension masculine noun  which it is not. [2] Actually one among many inverse suffixes.Works Cited:Dryer  Matthew S. 2005.
