  So many misconceptions in this question.First  Armenians do not descend from a man named Hayk -- this is an example of the eponymous founder fallacy. This fallacy takes the following form: you have a name  and you don't know where it comes from. So (usually following some kooky Biblical narrative or Greek myth) you simply assert that the name of the country comes from a single man. This was a very common fallacy in etymology in ancient times: it is found repeatedly in the Bible (Israel being the name of a man)  Rome (Romulus is transparently the name of the city 'Roma' with a diminutive suffix -ul-)  the Armenians from Hayk (Hay- is the Armenian word for Armenian plus a suffix -k) [1]  Georgia (the region of Kartli was attributed in the Middle Ages to a man named Kartlos  obviously a Hellenized version of Kartli)  and so forth.
