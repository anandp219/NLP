  In linguistics  the terms finite and nonfinite (usually without a hyphen) refer to an entirely different domain of language than the term infinite. As I mentioned in a previous answer (What is the difference between a finite verb and a nonfinite verb? )  finite and nonfinite are morphological aspects of verbal paradigms: a nonfinite verb form lacks overt marking for features like person  number and tense that a finite verb has (i.e. it is not 'limited' by them). Thus the difference between the two terms depends on the shape of the verb.Infiniteness in language is something altogether different.
