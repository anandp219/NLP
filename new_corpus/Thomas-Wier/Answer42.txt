In this language  it is no longer easily possible to form new verb roots. To form new verbs  instead you take a noun and then use one of thirty or so light verbs that are bleached of their meaning (much like when English speakers say 'do homework'). The nouns are incorporated into the verb  but are still morphologically distinct from them. What's interesting is that a number of these light verbs have suppletive stems in different tenses:(Udi data take from Harris' Endoclitics and the origins of Udi Morphosyntax; table mine)The implication of this is that  since new verb meanings have to be composed of light verbs  and since some light verbs have suppletive forms  new verbs in this language are indirectly systematically suppletive -- in effect  regularly irregular.
