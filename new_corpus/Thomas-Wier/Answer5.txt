Thus  even if the genders were purely formal  in which members did not share any semantic traits at all  gender agreement would still be useful.As for specific languages  it is always necessary to refer to the specific history of grammaticalization in specific languages  and we often do not know enough about that history to be certain why a particular gender system arose. English is an Indo-European language  and we know enough about Proto-Indo-European to believe that at some early stage PIE had two genders  animate and inanimate (a system attested in the earliest language to branch off  Hittite).
