Nizami himself was of mixed Persian/Kurdish background (his father was probably from Qom  but his mother was Kurdish).But in any event the answer is no  because there have always been speakers of other languages in Azerbaijan  and Persian was only ever at some points one among many  and a foreign interloper at that.
