in the same way as one of the arguments of the transitive clause. (This is true of by far the most common alignment types  nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive systems  though not of course for the other three rarer alignment patterns. )In some languages  ergative marking will show up on both nouns and verbs. This is true of Daghestanian languages  most of which mark the noun for ergative or absolutive case  and the verb for agreement with the absolutive argument in number and gender. For example  in the Hinuq language (a Tsezic language of Daghestan)  the nominal subjects of transitive verbs receive a special ergative case suffix  while intransitive subject nouns and transitive object nouns are unmarked (= absolutive case).
