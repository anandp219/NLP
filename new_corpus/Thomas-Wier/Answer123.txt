These groups conquered or replaced earlier groups including both Indo-European groups like the Hittites as well as non-Indo-European groups like the Hurrians  Urarteans  Hattites  etc.This process probably began around 1200 BC  with the Phrygians settling in central Anatolia near modern Ankara  while the closely related Armenians kept moving further east and south  where they occupied Urartean cities like Yerevan (whose Urartean name was Erebuni) finally only around 600 BC or so. (An image of Erebuni Fortress  now a suburb of modern Yerevan)The Armenians replaced the Urarteans  though we know few details about how.
