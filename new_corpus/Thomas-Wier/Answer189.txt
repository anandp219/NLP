If the stadialist hypothesis were true  then all languages would have reached their end state as accusative languages by the time of the first attested languages unless language change itself sped up furiously only in the last 5000 years. We would in other words expect there to be no ergative or active languages at all if language had been evolving at a steady pace over the last quarter million years.Thus the idea that some particular alignment systems of language are more 'primitive' than others is flawed; alignment systems of all types can show up everywhere in any society.
