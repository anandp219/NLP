But really  I'm not sure that metaphysics ever got all that much recognition. You can probably name  what  less than a dozen metaphysicists in the past couple of thousand years? There have been lots more  but they made little mark at the time  and are remembered today primarily only by other philosophers.The other thing often called "philosophy" is "ethics"  or more generally  the how-to-live-your-life branch of philosophy. There are actually a great many people doing that. They just don't call themselves "philosophers"  and they don't get academic degrees in it because... well  because that would be a lot of work for not a whole lot of payoff.
