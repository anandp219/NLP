The physics part is demonstrably more valid  and has been for a century at this point. A philosopher's pre-relativistic  pre-quantum view of time is as relevant as the humors theory of medicine. McTaggart had the excuse of writing in 1908  but the idea that modern physics treats time as an "illusion" is absurd. Time is in the equations  to which experiments adhere to a dozen decimal places; whether that's "real" or an "illusion" is a matter of semantics  not science. The human conception of time might be an "illusion"  as a function of humans perceiving things... but that's a matter of neurology  not physics.
