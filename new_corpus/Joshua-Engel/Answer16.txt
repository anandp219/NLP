This issue of faith is pretty abstruse  better handled in the contemplative nature of a book rather than the go-go-go nature of a film. Jackson also sought ways to cut the larger-than-life characters down to make the book more of an epic and less of a myth; that choice I am less sanguine about  but I understand it.But I think he went too far with Denethor  and I feel that that scene in particular suffered for it. It doesn't humanize Denethor to turn him into a cartoon villain. Instead of an opportunity to engender real grief for a human whose fault is very similar to our own  we feel contempt for Denethor.
