  Salt has no calories. It can exacerbate the effects of being overweight  but it won't make you fat by itself. (Extreme salt intake can cause edema  which looks very superficially like fat  but that's just a footnote. )You do need salt. You probably end up eating all you need every day  unless your diet is severely restricted or you have other health issues. Unless advised by a doctor you probably don't need to go out of your way to look for salt. Nor do you especially need to avoid it  unless you've got health issues that require it.
