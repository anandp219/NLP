  The Noldor didn't hinder Melkor's quest to rule Middle-earth. Before the Valar returned  he did control Middle-earth. Morgoth was kept bottled up for a few centuries after the Dagor Aglareb  but even that couldn't hold him all that long. All three Elven strongholds were destroyed. The one he couldn't destroy himself was destroyed for him by a combination of the Dwarves and the Noldor.The houses of Beor  Hador  and Haleth did some good work harassing Morgoth's troops  and if Thingol and Melian could have been convinced to help them  it's possible that they could have kept Morgoth at bay.
