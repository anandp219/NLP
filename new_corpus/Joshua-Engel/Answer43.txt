  The Dagor Dagorath as described in the unpublished version of the Quenta Silmarillion is not canon  but there are references to a Last Battle in the Silmarillion:Menelmacar with his shining belt. that forebodes the Last Battle that shall be at the end of days.But Ar-Pharazn the King and the mortal warriors that had set foot upon the land of Aman were buried under falling hills: there it is said that they lie imprisoned in the Caves of the Forgotten  until the Last Battle and the Day of Doom. We get a few passing notions to a remaking of the world  presumably at the end:But their joy in victory was diminished  for they returned without the Silmarils from Morgoth's crown  and they knew that those jewels could not be found or brought together again unless the world be broken and remade.for the history was incomplete and the circles of time not full-wrought when the vision was taken away.
