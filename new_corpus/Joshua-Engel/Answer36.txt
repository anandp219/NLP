  The field of "philosophy" has diversified. A lot of things that used to be called "philosophy" are given other names: economics  psychology  even science and politics. Two hundred years ago  anybody who is now a TV pundit might have been called a philosopher. So would Stephen Hawking. So  for that matter  would Deepak Chopra  which is actually kinda the point. When any piece of crap can be "philosophy"  people tend to go looking for the particlar domains that are less crap-ridden.When people say "philosophy" they usually mean "metaphysics".
