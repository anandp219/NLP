It's best done by dedicated personnel who want to be there and will be there for at least four years. You can't just take a civilian  hand him a gun for a year  and expect him to serve well. That hadn't worked well 40 years ago  and it works even less well now.So the US is reducing its military presence and has no need of additional soldiers  much less cranky short-timers. A draft would be wildly counterproductive.
