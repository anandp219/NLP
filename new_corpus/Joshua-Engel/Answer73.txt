TNG is  I find  even more popular at Trek conventions than TOS is; it captured the zeitgeist of a different generation from mine. It has been decades since then  and Trek is a good universe in which to go looking for the feeling that captures people's imaginations now. It's even entirely possible that it can be a great show without appealing to me. So in the end  I just don't really have a reaction  other than to hope that they manage to do something good  same as I'd feel about any story. I'm afraid that Trek lost me at Voyager; I simply do not feel attached to its universe as a whole and I don't particularly feel like a new series automatically has to impact me one way or the other.
