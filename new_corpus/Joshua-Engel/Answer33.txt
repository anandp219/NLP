The same tropes come up over and over because they are entertaining. It's not a "message" you need to hear from either film  since it's one you've already heard. Rather  it's a theme that's interesting to hear about  and it can be dressed up in wildly varying guises. Different forms will appeal to different people  and that's just fine. If you don't like 300  don't go see it. It's not the filmmaker's job to tell you what to see. It's the job of the movie reviewer  and I thought they did a pretty good job of telling me what to expect from 300.
