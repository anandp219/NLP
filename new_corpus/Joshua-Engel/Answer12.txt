That's before you get the insurance companies involved (who actually kinda don't want the patient to get treated  since they have to pay for it). These people have been making do with paper for decades. Paper is actually pretty good at keeping things secure  at least from hackers on the Internet. But it's really  really bad for sharing. They've been developing individual software solutioins to try to cope with that  but integrating that software is hard enough without swapping around credentials (which starts with a really difficult challenge of just ensuring that "Patient Tom Jones" in system A is the same as "Patient Tom Jones" in system B... on down to system ZZ 9 plural Z alpha).Credit cards are comparatively trivial  since the only parties involved are you  the merchant  and the credit card company  sharing a very small amount of transaction information.
