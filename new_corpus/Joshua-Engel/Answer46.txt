  That was the thesis of one paper in 2003:Potential Environmental Impact of a Hydrogen Economy on the StratosphereThe widespread use of hydrogen fuel cells could have hitherto unknown environmental impacts due to unintended emissions of molecular hydrogen  including an increase in the abundance of water vapor in the stratosphere (plausibly by as much as 1 part per million by volume). This would cause stratospheric cooling  enhancement of the heterogeneous chemistry that destroys ozone  an increase in noctilucent clouds  and changes in tropospheric chemistry and atmosphere-biosphere interactions.Another paper a few months later disputed that  noting the effects of reduction of NO and CO compouunds:Air Pollution and Climate-Forcing Impacts of a Global Hydrogen EconomyIf today's surface traffic fleet were powered entirely by hydrogen fuel cell technology  anthropogenic emissions of the ozone precursors nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide could be reduced by up to 50%  leading to significant improvements in air quality throughout the Northern Hemisphere.
