The colder your cold sink is  the more efficient it can be. If you had an infinite sink of absolute zero  you could be perfectly efficient. But you don't have access to an infinite cold sink. You have only the area around you  where even the cold things are at a few hundred degrees Kelvin.The universe as a whole may actually be perfectly efficient  as everything in the universe winds its way to its heat death. But right where we are  you're limited by the Cosmic microwave background  a 3K heat bath that surrounds everybody and everything  and that's the practical limit on how well you can do.
