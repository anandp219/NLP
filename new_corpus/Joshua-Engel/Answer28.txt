You have to have Faith. Not just "faith" that you have reason that things will work out (in Elvish "amdir"  from manuscripts not published during his lifetime)  but Faith that things will work out despite a very good reason to think that they won't (Elvish "Estel"  which is familiar as Aragorn's nickname). Tolkien was big on "eucastastrophe"  "the sudden happy turn in a story which pierces you with a joy that brings tears". He used the term mostly to describe stories  but he's also talking about religious faith: The Birth of Christ is the eucatastrophe of Man's history.
