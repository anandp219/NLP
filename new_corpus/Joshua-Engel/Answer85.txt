It incorporates the length contraction that Einstein was referring to in his footnote without needing to assign any structure to the electron. Instead  it is a property of the quantum field  as viewed from the reference frame.To my knowledge (via a review of the literature in Google Scholar)  nobody has ever done any work on Einstein's guess. And in the intervening years  general relativity has moved farther away from quantum mechanics. It's possible that a unified theory might in the end give general relativity some kind of role to play in whatever structure electrons might turn out to have.
