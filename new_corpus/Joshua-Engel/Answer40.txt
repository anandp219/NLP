As a purely probabilistic matter  the universe is more likely to be in a state where heat can't transfer than a state where it can.If you could get work out of a heat engine with no losses  then you could run the process in reverse to create more hot and cold spots just by pumping in energy. If you could do that losslessly  you could reverse the entropy of the universe. And as we just said  that's unlikely: there are more ways for the universe to lack order (separation of hot and cold) than to be ordered.So any heat engine has a maximum efficiency  which is defined by the ratio of the temperatures between the cold and the hot.
