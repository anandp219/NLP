It's that the momentum and position are literally not well defined; they exist as a range. Via interaction you can narrow one down  at the cost of increasing the uncertainty in the other  but both will retain some uncertainty. That interaction is not necessarily an "observation".That minimum uncertainty is a fundamental constant of the universe. No matter how small your probes are  you can't circumvent them. Even if they could  neutrinos are poor choices for it  because they don't interact with things very much.
