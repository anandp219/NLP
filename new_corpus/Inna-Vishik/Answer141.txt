Part of this stems from the sexiness of graphene among certain corners of the condensed matter research/funding community. But on the scientific side  graphene (and other carbon-based materials like buckeyballs and diamond) have an attractive feature for superconductivity: high frequency phonons (because carbon is a light atom which tends to form very stiff bonds). Unfortunately  most carbon-based materials are insulators or semimetals  which don't have enough electron density for phonon-mediated superconductivity to happen.
