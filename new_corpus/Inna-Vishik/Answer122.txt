If it is 85 outside (not unlikely since many 5Ks are during the summer)  prepare to run slower than you might wish. If you usually run with a water bottle  don't be afraid to carry one during the race  even if people around you don't have them. At the same time  you don't need to pack your gear belt like you are a mule commuting across the desert; a 5K isn't that long.A warmup is helpful for a shorter distance race. This might involve jogging from your home instead of driving (if feasible)  or it might involve jogging around the starting area for 5-20 minutes.
