  The best route for making a high salary with a physics degree is to not work as a physicist--instead go into finance or a hot startup. This route is most natural for subfields which are very mathematical (fun fact: not all of physics is super mathematical) and also have a large computational component. If this is what you want to do  be a theoretical physicist of some sort (specific subfield not too important) but not the exclusively pencil/paper kind. Or better yet  don't major in physics if your primary goal is to make a lot of money.If your goal is to earn a good salary (or even a relatively high salary) while working as a physicist in academia (I can't comment on the options  if any  outside of academia)  your subfield is not too important  provided it is a field which is expected to stay active in the near future (see: What are the most active fields of physics for graduate students to consider nowadays?).
