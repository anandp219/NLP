Your probability of earning a decent salary is higher if you end up being a professor (not some soft money position) at a top  private research institution (many public schools are fantastic for research  but the salaries are lower). Some fields have more positions than others  so your choice of subfield does have some impact on your liklihood of becoming a professor. Condensed matter and biophysics (especially experiment) seem to have comparatively good prospects  but other subfields probably do too (if you're really curious  go through all the listings here and see which subfields are most 'employable.')
