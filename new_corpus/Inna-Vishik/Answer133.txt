  It depends. The more you know about your superconductor  the more hard limits can be placed.If you are thinking of a specific material which becomes superconducting by a certain mechanism  then the theoretical limit can be quite modest. For example  if one considers specific materials whose superconductivity is described by Bardeed-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory  one can theoretically tune the parameters which are favorable to superconductivity--high density of electron states at the Fermi level and high electron-phonon coupling--within physical limits to ascertain what is the theoretical limit for this material.
