  I hate to disappoint the person who asked this question  but my running wardrobe  unlike my real-life wardrobe  is 100% function over form. This means I will wear running shorts that make me looks 20 lbs heavier if they have a zip pocket  and I will wear any hideous color if that article of clothing keeps me at the appropriate temperature. The upshot of all this is I do not wear my workout clothes to the office or to the grocery store (after all  they are ugly  and oh yeah  I actually work out in them).The functional aspects of running outfits I am most serious about are zip pockets  thermal management  and sports bras.I do not like running shorts without zip pockets big enough to hold my phone  and I will not buy a phone which will not fit in my running shorts.
