There are physics professors who make very high salaries (e.g. Steve Weinberg at UT austin)  but this does not correlate with a specific subfield--it usually correlates with being a top talent in one's subfield and being willing to move for a higher paying position.If you are curious about specific numbers for physics professors' salaries  most public universities in the US publicly list all employees salaries as required by their state's law.
