  I experienced the trauma of Liboff's quantum mechanics book in my undergraduate introductory class  coupled with a professor who thought this would be a good idea. My main problem with the book is that it is terrible as an introductory textbook because it is written in such a way to show off to an expert audience how well another expert has synthesized quantum mechanics and distilled it into 'simpler' language (and also "remixed" it into an uncoventional exposition order). This attempt to appeal to an expert audience is perhaps why some professors are drawn to Liboff  but undergraduates are decidedly NOT experts  and they need more thoughtful pedagogy.Below are some specific complaints  based on the 4th edition of the book.
