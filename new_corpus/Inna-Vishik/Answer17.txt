Below are some examples of recent systematic searches for high temperature superconductors:Searching for new high temperature superconductors based on iron-based high temperature superconductorsOne of the most important developments in superconductivity research in the past decade was the discovery of a new family of high-temperature superconductors: the iron-based superconductors. For four years starting March 2010  the person who discovered superconductivity in these iron pnictide materials  Hideo Hosono  led a consortium of 6 professors (mostly solid state chemists) in an effort to discover new (hopefully high-Tc) superconductors and engineer useful products out of iron-based superconductors.
