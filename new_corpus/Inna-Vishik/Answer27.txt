  Yes  secondary electrons can be photoemitted if a photon has excess energy. The higher the photon energy  the more probable this is. Photoemission of secondary electrons happens via a multi-step process  not by having two electrons absorb part of the photon's energy simultaneously.Photoemission due to the photoelectric effect is described via the 'three step model. 'An electron in an occupied band absorbs a photon and gets excited into an unoccupied state. At this point  the work function of the material has not entered into the picture yet.source: Page on springer.comThe electron travels to the surface of the material.
