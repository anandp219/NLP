*the word 'expensive' needs to be qualified here: I mean several hundred thousand up to several million dollars. This is expensive by most civilian price scales  but is much cheaper than large facilities like the LHC  and much cheaper than most types of federal expenditure. Thus  it actually represents a good bang-for-the-buck as far as science funding is concerned.
