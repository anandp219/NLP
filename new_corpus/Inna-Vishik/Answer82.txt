The passive ones can be substituted by a nail if you really want to risk scratching the screen. The active ones are little RF transmitters which give the phone/tablet information about the stylus's location and pressure. The active styluses  when they are operated in conjunction with certain programs or features  use software mechanisms to ignore gestures which do not originate from the pen.
