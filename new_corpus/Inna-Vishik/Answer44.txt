Still  many condensed matter physicists (including Nobel laureates) do not believe that there will be a Nobel prize awarded for a theoretical explanation of the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity*. Why is this?Seemingly every theorist thinks that they solved it already  with some data supporting their explanation and other data refuting it.It is debatable if there is a Nobel-worthy breakthrough to be had there. For instance  if the mechanism is just a different 'pairing glue' (e.g. spin fluctuations instead of phonons)  BCS theory already permits this.There might be a Nobel prize to be had related to other aspects of high-temperature superconducting materials  such as strong electron correlations.So why do people continue to study high temperature superconductors?
