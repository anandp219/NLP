In the end  this group synthesized ~1000 new compounds  and superconductivity was found in several tens of new compounds. None of them had a high Tc  but they did have success in engineering wires out of iron-based superconductors for applications. This collaboration also emphasized publishing their failures--the compounds which were synthesized but not found to be superconductors--in order for future researchers not to waste time.
