Although each successive theory is more 'correct' than the former  each model has some degree of truth and/or usefulness in it. As such  physicists often simultaneously have several descriptions in mind when trying to understand condensed matter phenomena. The entire preceding paragraph is background for the following disclaimer: Brownian motion is a classical phenomenon  but electrons are not classical. Still  there is a phenomenon in metals called JohnsonNyquist noise (sometimes just Johnson noise) which is directly analogous to Brownian motion via the Fluctuation-dissipation theorem (which applies equally to quantum and classical systems).
