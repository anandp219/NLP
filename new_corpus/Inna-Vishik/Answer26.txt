Metals tend to have higher thermal conductivity than non-metals (try putting your hot coffee in a copper mug) because the former has free electrons to carry heat and the latter does not.For the specific case in the question  glass vs mercury  the glass in the question likely does not have a high degree of crystallinity at the atomic scale  which limits its lattice thermal conductivity. In addition  it is an insulator (and a pretty good one if it is transparent)  which limits its electronic thermal conductivity.
