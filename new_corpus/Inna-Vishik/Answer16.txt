  There are research groups and collaborations that strive to discover and/or engineer new high-temperature and/or novel superconductors. I previously discussed one set of strategies here. Because condensed matter physics  materials science  and solid state chemistry are empirical sciences  people search for new and/or high temperature superconductors based on known superconducting materials and physics which is understood about superconductors. Meanwhile  many other scientists work to understand unconventional and high-temperature superconductors that have already been discovered  in order to eventually formulate new pathways for engineering new superconductors.
