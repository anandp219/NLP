Helium-4 is a very poor candidate for extraterrestrial mining because you really need a lot of it (unlike  say  platinum) to do anything useful. Long before prices rise enough to make extraterestrial mining a topic of conversation  you will see the end of recreational helium balloons  all research/industrial users will be required to recycle  and mining operations will become more keen on extracting/selling smaller amounts of helium instead of just releasing it to atmosphere.Helium-3Helium-3 is a rarer isotope of helium  and most of it is manufactured as a byproduct of nuclear energy/weapons  rather than mined like helium-4 (though it can also be mined).
