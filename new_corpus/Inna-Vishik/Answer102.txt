  Difficulty (or more precisely  utter failure) is a common experience when trying to do a novel or challenging experiment. In the academic context  when one has already sunk money and/or time into a specific experiment  the goal is to make it work  even if the working form ends up being different or less ambitious than the initial conception.I view tinkering and conceptual re-evaluation as existing on a spectrum. On one end is the brainless moving of knobs and rebooting of random components in hopes of an easy fix; this is often what we default to for initial troubleshooting or out of crushing desperation.
