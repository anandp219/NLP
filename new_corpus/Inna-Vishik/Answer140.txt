  Superconductivity in [math]CaC_6[/math] (graphene layers with calcium atoms arranged in an orderly way between them) is a persistent phenomenon. There is basically one research group in the world which has claimed transiently enhanced (in one case room temperature) superconductivity under certain light-excitation conditions in other materials  and these results are very controversial in the research community. On the other hand  time-persistent superconductivity is a fairly ubiquitous ground state that many materials (some exotic and some mundane) realize at low temperature (and sometimes not super low temperature).Researchers have been thinking about how to make graphene superconduct for a while.
