  A LinkedIn profile for someone in an academic career is different in that it is almost never the primary way in which they showcase their skills  accomplishments  and qualification.For academics who are not looking to transition into a different career  a LinkedIn profile does not serve the same utilities as it does for people in other professions.A means for someone to contact them in a professional capacity: contact information for academics is usually available on their institution's websiteVisibility to recruiters: the 'recruiters' for academic positions are professional academics themselves  and they either contact people by the means above or because they personally know them alreadyJob postings: very few academic jobs are posted on LinkedIn.
