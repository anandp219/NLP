The second ingredient of white light generation is self-phase modulation  which is a consequence of an intensity-dependent index of refraction coupled with a beam intensity with a strong time-dependence. The rising edge of the pulse will see an increasing index of refraction leading to an increase phase lag  and the trailing edge of the pulse will see the opposite. This instantaneous phase shift will result in an instantaneous frequency shift such that a spectrum broader in frequency than the original is produced.source: Self-phase modulation
