  "What is a good snowboard" depends more on your personal preferences than anything else. For some narrow  well-defined disciplines like racing  there are key parameters that you probably won't want to deviate from very much  but freeride is a pretty broad term.If you are in an area where it is feasible to rent a few different kinds of boards  that's a great way to try boards with different charcteristics. Take notes on length  width  sidecut radius (a massively under-appreciated parameter) and how you felt on that board in different conditions.
