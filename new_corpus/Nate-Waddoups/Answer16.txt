  Hopefully that layman has a long attention span  because this is complicated. The conflict has its roots in the SykesPicot Agreement of 1916  in which the British and French agreed upon separate 'spheres of influence' in the middle East. Over the next decades  various states and governments were declared in the area  mostly with little or no regard to the existing power structures.But then let us fast-forward to just a few years ago... Bashar al Assad  the President or Syria  was like his father before him  an authoritarian ruler.In nearby countries  people protested their authoritarian rulers in a series of demonstrations that came to be known as the "Arab Spring."
