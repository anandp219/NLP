The first time was Halloween  so I had an easy excuse  and I was very surprised by how many people told me they admired the courage that it took to do that. So the second time was easy (theme party  it was just easier to play along with the theme if I went as a woman). There's nothing embarrassing about doing something nobody expects. In fact  the opposite is true. Stepping outside of society's expectations takes a lot more strength than most people have  and most people will recognize that. So go for it  and be proud that you're one of the few who will actually take that step.
