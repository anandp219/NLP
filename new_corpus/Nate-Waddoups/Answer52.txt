  First  know that all generalizations are false. But some generalizations are useful. For example:If the comments are explaining what the code does  that's generally a sign that the code should have been written more clearly. Use more descriptive variable names  extract chunks of code into methods that can be given descriptive names  factor out classes to keep them simple (single responsibility principle). And so on. If the comments are explaining why the code does what it does  that's generally a good thing.
