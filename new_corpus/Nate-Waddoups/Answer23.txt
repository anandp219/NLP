After checks are required  the requirements will be modified to prevent anyone from actually passing the check. (There is precedent - one of my colleagues came from a county in California that required specific training in order to obtain a concealed handgun license. The county didn't offer that training  so they didn't grant those licenses. )So it's not just "the NRA" that opposes background checks and registration requirements - it's a whole bunch of law-abiding  firearm-owning voters  who have been given solid reasons (for example  this article) to fear that background checks are a veiled attempt to ban ownership  and registration is a step toward confiscation.
