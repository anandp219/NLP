  ...and correspondingly  why have previous generations been so nonchalant about social injustice and identity? Why did so many people  for so many years  think that it was OK to marginalize groups of people based on such arbitrary factors as race  religion  gender  sexual preference  and so on?The first thing to note is that this is not new. The "obsession" with righting pervasive wrongs goes back centuries. In the United States  arguments over slavery date back to at least the 1700s  and in the mid-1800s there were heated arguments over whether or not women should be allowed to vote.
