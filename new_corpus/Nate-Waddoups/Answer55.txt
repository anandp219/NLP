In addition  even in the best-case scenario  in which you miraculously shoot the aggressor and don't get shot by the aggressor or another good-guy-with-a-gun  you're likely to lose everything you own defending against criminal charges brought by people who weren't there to see what you saw  in addition to a civil suit by the aggressor or their surviving kin. So unless you or a loved one is in immediate danger of a much worse outcome  it's best to just get yourself and your loved ones as far away as fast as possible.I have taken three classes on gun safety and self-defense  from two schools  and in every class the position on this issue has been the exactly same - do not get involved in violence unless you or your loved ones are being threatened.
