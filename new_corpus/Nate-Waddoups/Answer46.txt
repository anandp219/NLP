Much of what everybody knows is actually fiction. The recent incident of a vigilante shooting at a shoplifter is sounds like a pretty clear example of someone who knew much less about firearms than they thought they did. Unless new information comes to light  I'd expect the shooter to spend some time in jail  and lose their right to own firearms ever again (assault with a deadly weapon is a felony  and felons are prohibited). Fortunately  nobody got injured  crippled  or killed.
