People who believe things that are not true and then spread such nontruths are called denialists and suffer from a neuroses that somehow allows their "learning" to be filtered and their "knowledge" to be highly selective. They are truly dangerous to society in that they normally have a hidden agenda regarding other false beliefs  and you would be wise to carefully avoid such people.
