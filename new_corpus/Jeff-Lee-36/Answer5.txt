  You probably can't. The reason you probably can't is because you have an incorrect view of many things. You have a viewpoint regarding the meaning of life  which you are not likely to change. You have an idea of what is good and bad  and not only are you not likely to change  you are probably incorrect  as you are not qualified to have an opinion on what is good or bad if you are unaware of all of the ramifications of an act and if you value what is valueless and do not see the wisdom in certain laws or certain lessons.
