  I don't think I can speak for Campbell  but I think I understand his position  one I don't agree  completely  that if a religion's basic tenets are taken as metaphor  that they are basically pointing to a path that leads to a perceived truth regarding the essential questions  "who am I? where did I come from? and where am I going?" But  the fallacy is that attempts to define the ineffable are of little value if you are not able to understand the complete truth. The differences in the foundations between dualistic versus nondualistic teachings make it impossible to communicate because it is like entities from two different universes trying to hold a conversation.
