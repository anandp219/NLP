People want to know how and the gurus say  "when you stop trying." It happens almost be accident  but as Ram Dass says  "Meditation makes you accident prone." This inner guidance  or personal inspiration  can be said to be many things  a connection to the inner divine  a connection to cosmic conciousness  you higher self  or simply the unconcious mind. It is not necessary that we agree what it is or how it works  but meditation does aid the process  because it tends to quiet the ego mind in favor of letting your real mind make its appearance.
