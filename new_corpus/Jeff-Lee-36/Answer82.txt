It is far too clever to be argued out of existence. It merely weakens when you have ceased to need it and when we are focused on truth. It is selling fear and false beliefs. Logic alone will not make it go away. You learn that you are not your ego  by not listening to it. This is not easy  but it can be done. You need to meditate and become the observer. Or perhaps more accurately  the observer of the observer. The other thing you need to do is live your highest values. In so doing  you become less judgmental  more forgiving  able to see the good in others.
