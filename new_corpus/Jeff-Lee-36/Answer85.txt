My choice is meditation. It is not that it is a path in itself  although it could be; it might speed up the living and remove some of the pain or the doubt. It does this by quieting the ego. Whenever you can make decisions without the ego  you are seeing the real you  that unconscious self that has the higher values and is unconcerned with having reasons to do things  (impressing people  being in control  being right  getting back at people  justifying hatreds  protecting from perceived threats  isolating from love  being special  protecting cherished false beliefs; attacking enemies)  such as the typical motivations of egoic thinking.
