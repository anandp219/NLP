Religions are very much like that. At the risk of spreading more shortcut messages that could potentially be abused  I do find a few abbreviated thought processes that are helpful to me. One is Assess  Align  and Act  which like ready  aim  fire  is important to do in the right order to be of any value. Its value to me is that it helps remind me that I need only see things clearly  then check to see if it aligns with my values  then act only after having determined that it is what was the right thing to do all along once I untangle or de-complicate the issues surrounding a problem or a set of equal appearing choices.
