Even if  in your paradigm  the world of the mind is a vast unity of thought of all that exists  and the brain a near worthless hunk of meat  then an over dramatized metaphor would be the world of the mind is your computer or tablet  and the brain is merely the screen  or the glass of your tablet. Everything has to come through that nearly worthless glass if you are to see the inner-workings.
