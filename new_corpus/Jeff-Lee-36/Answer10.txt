I get so bored I could scream. Besides... there isn't going to be any war.Open your eyes and look at me. No  I don't think I will kiss you  although you need kissing badly. That's what's wrong with you. You should be kissed and often and by someone who knows how.No  I'm not hinting. I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees are better equipped than we. They've got factories  shipyards  coalmines... and a fleet to bottle up our harbors and starve us to death. All we've got is cotton  and slaves and... arrogance.
