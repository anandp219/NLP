  I have not been 19 in a while  but I do recall wanting to save the world  somewhat. I recall thinking that I was an automatic negative due to my carbon footprint and that unless I could prove my positive net worth  by accomplishing something meaningful for the world  that I should kill myself. Yes  there is nothing like the passion of not having a passion. Youthful angst is normal. I remember saying to someone that i believed my mother loved me for all the wrong reasons. Today  the idea of love having a reason is ludicrous.
