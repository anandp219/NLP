If you misunderstand cause and effect  you will misunderstand which is which and criticize the path even though it is accomplishing your desired goal.So  are you willing to totally change your thinking? Most people are not. So  ask yourself honestly  "am I willing to take the risk of losing who I think I am in order to find out who I really am?" Only in so doing  will you be able to transform your thinking. Once done  you might look upon the world with love and bemusement  and neither attached to the outcome nor judgmental of what appears next.
