That is what you should be communicating to your son. I am glad he is now safe. I hope you truly want him home and that he will return  as you both have some healing to do  and being together is a chance for both of you to grow toward one another rather than apart. As for the big mistake  I hope you learned never to judge a loved one harshly  again  and espevially  that a loving parent never rejects their child regardless of the initial shock. You have plenty of good advice  including resources from which you can learn more about gay teens  gay adults  family support groups  and ways you can personally strengthen your relationship wit your son.
