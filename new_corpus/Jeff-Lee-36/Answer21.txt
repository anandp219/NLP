Not all therapists are apparently taught this way  but I find his explanations very wise and experienced. It helps me to think through these types of questions from this perspective  not only when looking at others  but when considering my own mind  my own ego  my own needs for personal growth  and that we are all capable of shifting our current spot on any continuum.Therefore  if he is right  and the opposite of empathy is psychopathy or sociopathy  it might make sense to say that not everyone is normal (empathetic) or unable to exhibit empathy or relate to others beyond sympathy (psychopath or sociopath)  then  some people will exist somewhere on a continuum of a specific symptomology  without being outside the norms for normal and healthy.
