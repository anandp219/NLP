If you simply have mental blocks against meditation  because you think you have tried it and it made you uncomfortabe  try it again  it is supposed to make you uncomfortable at first. If you really refuse to try it just because  no rational reason  just because  I am not sure your question is serious. But  if you claim you want this change without doing that  I recommend doing public service for others  and forgiving your enemies; both will reach the same end result  your ego loses its hold as the primary force in your life  and you will feel inspired to live your life for the betterment of society and for the love of others for the simple selfish reason that such behavior now gives you joy!
