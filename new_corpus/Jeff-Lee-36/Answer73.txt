  The major religions all stem from one religion  so it is not surprising that they all have the same stance on certain subjects. The nature of the Bible is that it is a collection of writings of a few dozen people over a period of nearly two thousand years  starting around 4000 years ago  these writings were a mix of Babylonian mythology  history of the Jews  metaphorical fairy tales  and an occasional story of morality or supposed miracles. It is these last two that are the attraction of religious philosophers.
