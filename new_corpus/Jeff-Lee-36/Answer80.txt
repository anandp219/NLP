There were another dozen things wrong with my thinking back then. And of all my peers. And even half of my peers  today. They want to be right  they want to be soevial  they want to judge  and none of those things matter. The only thing that matters is discovering who you are. It is the only thing that removes the angst and the suffering inherent in every life that has not discovered it. It is the only way to find your special function. Oddly  it must sound circular to those that don't get it  because it sounds like I am saying that you find your purpose by living your purpose.
