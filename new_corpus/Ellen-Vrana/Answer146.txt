An essay accepts it might not be the defining argument/viewpoint  but it presents the best reasoned argument as it occurs to the author. It shows the hand of the author  as necessary support or to indicate possible biases.Figure out what you want your Essay to be (and not be) and it will be much easier to write it consistently and coherently.In the mean time  how do you improve your essay-writing skills?Take time to read either the examples I mentioned  especially Pinker and Kundera to know how the genre has progressed and changed and just how much latitude there can be.
