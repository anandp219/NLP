  To be honest  the fact that it's expensive prevents me from stealing it. I "steal" inexpensive things all the time. Those little wooden stirrers from Starbucks  I use them to prop up plants I grow from seed. Is 5 stealing? What about 30?I once stole a nice computer bag out of a donate pile and used it for a year. That's stealing from Salvation Army  they could have sold it.I stole a bunch of perfume samples from someone's house - they were shiny and smelly and I loved them and used them.When I was really young  I used to go with Mom to the garden store and pick up all the fake flowers that had fallen into the aisle.
