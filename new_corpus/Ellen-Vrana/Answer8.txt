No  that's an insult to toast. Dull as as a toaster that doesn't have toast.You won't connect with everyone. No one does.Above all  this is CRITICAL and the most important thing you can doBE INTERESTED IN THE PERSON YOU'RE TALKING TO.Actually care. That is the secret.Small talk is a way to get to know interesting people. Not to show you're interesting. People don't judge you based on your resume; they judge you based on how they connect to you. Care about them  you'll connect to them.
