It's ok to like something specific written by a male rather than a female.It's ok to have interests and hobbies that are dominated by male POVs (although  like me with movies  you might want to check on this).It is NOT ok to not read females or not like their writing JUST BECAUSE they are female. If you find yourself having this problem  then you have an issue and we can talk about that in another question.
