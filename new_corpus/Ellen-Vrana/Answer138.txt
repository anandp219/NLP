"Functional prose" it's been called.Montaigne wrote Essais in 1580 as a combination of political viewpoints  personal anecdotes and self-discovery. Surprisingly the volumes were mainly attractive to females  at least those were fortunate enough to be able to read. Or perhaps not surprising since the writings were intimate and personal in nature.From Montaigne to present  the essay has taken many forms and frequently used more as a genre to describe a well-conceived  argued  reasoned  non-fiction.
