Or at least  they don't mind that consequence. I can accept that. Quora's a business. It will do what it has to do as a business. If not keeping me happy is part of that  so be it. Ultimately  is this credit change good or bad? Depends on how you use Quora. It might be good  bad or irrelevant. I have no insight into Quora's changes or motivations. The answer is speculation  not fact.
