argues that Jane Eyre fails because the main character acts incongruously of what we'd expect in so many ways that in fact  it almost isn't Jane's fault when she makes the choices she makes  it's her authors'. (I'm more direct about this than Cristina is  I blame Charlotte Bronte entirely :). )Another example is Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn. I dislike this book. Sure it's easy to read and the plot was catchy  but the characters were horrible. I found myself baffled by their choices  unable to find their real motivations and hating them for being so erratic.
