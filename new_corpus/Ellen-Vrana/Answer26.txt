The way you feel about your work  that is yours and yours alone. My writing comes from a depth that I must travel to alone. I've never felt so alone. Career writers see writing as hard work  but worth it. Occasionally it has rewards  but you don't expect them. You don't anticipate them.

And then perhaps a wine before we tear it all up and try again.
