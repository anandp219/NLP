  True love is a destination at the end of an infinite journey that our lifetimes are too short to complete. Perhaps when you check off all the things below (and more) then you've arrived at the TRUE LOVE station:I love you  not because you make me feel how I deserve to feel.I love you  not because I'm scared of being alone.I love you  not because you're better than the last person.I love you  not because my friends or parents like you.I love you  not because you can do things for me.I love you not because you give me access or opportunity.I love you  not because it is easy.I love you  not because it is convenient.I love you  not because you keep me from being bored.I love you  not because you promote my self-esteem.I love you  not because you love me back.I love you  not because you reinforce my worldview and values.I love you  not because I need to love something.I love you  not because I'm replacing the love I didn't feel from my parents.It takes a special person to be able to say all of these things and mean them.
