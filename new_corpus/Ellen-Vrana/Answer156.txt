and ice that clinks. (Or is it chinks? My eyes glaze over . . . )In the city there are cars honking  lights blinking and there are many things that are incessant; noise  screams  cries  honking.

The moon is always bathing things  the fog is always thick or dense  sometimes both. Thunderstorms rage while thunder cracks.
