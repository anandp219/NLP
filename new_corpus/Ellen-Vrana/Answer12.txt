and the top return is a link to Quora. Because Quora has the best answers on the internet. This is where their growth is. To get to the BEST answer returned in a Google search  they have to get the BEST answer according to their algorithm.Your promotions were getting in the way. You promote bad content. You distort the system. I don't  because I'm a Top Writer  and I have proven good taste - except  I don't. Crap. No  my promotions weren't good either  and I actually made more of a mess because I have so many credits and promoted so often.So now they're removing the untrustworthy human component which might not lead to the best answer on the internet  and replacing it with well  nothing.
