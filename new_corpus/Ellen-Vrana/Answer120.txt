consistent with his character. It wasn't a deus ex machina or random hand of the writer to make the plot work. The story suggested his ultimate salvation earlier and then made good on it ultimately. It was a surprise yes but plausible  nonetheless.Is this the gesture of a total monster? Up to you.Another great example is Lord of the Flies  an viscous  dystopian novel that depicts the descent into barbarism of a group of young boys abandoned on a deserted island. In the absence of basic needs like food and shelter  the children's efforts at an ordered society fall apart and they turn murderous.In this case  we can judge the characters.
