Follow up with: What's it like this time of year? How long have you lived there? Do you like living there? Has it changed much in the past 20 years? (Most places have and this is always interesting).The purpose of a follow-up is to let the person know you are interested in them and to prompt them with an easy conversation topic so you can engage. 3. Use physical communication to show interest and emotion.Imagine a robot saying "I find you interesting." Creeepy. Words alone don't work.To convey a genuine sense of interest  you have to emote.That's interesting.
