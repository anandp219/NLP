I ALWAYS post the best photos of myself having the BEST time  and doing the MOST amazing things. Isn't that what Facebook is for?People's lives are much more nuanced than you think  and their problems much larger. See their happiness differently. So those are your options.From my experience a few sound good  but don't work. Ditching your happy friends  is that really what you want? Good luck with that  Scrooge.Just BEING more exceptional  yes - sure  that helps. But  haven't you tried this? Haven't we all?
