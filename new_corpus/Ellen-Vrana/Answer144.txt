Kundera is an immensely thoughtful and self-aware person  a master of self-expression.My second example for this abstractness is Colin Wilson's 1956 classic The Outsider. A long essay about alienation  creativity and the modern mind. It explores the concept of one who - for a variety of reasons - views society from without. I responded to the content as a writer  but the Essay structure is also good and informative.Personally  I try to fight against thinking of Essay as "a literary genre of anything non-fiction."
