At 45  that is when the crisis hits. Emotional shingles. All over body-pain that is overwhelming and you realize you're stuck. You implode. You have an affair or two  a face-lift  new car  maybe an ulcer  lots of whiskey and you start sabotaging your life because you just want out. Or you keep your head down and keep going because the people who depend on you are more important than your happiness.Either way  you're not happy.You don't know at 28 what your 31  35  40  45 self wants. Plan for long-term and make investments by  all means.
