I have to keep him fed  tame  and hidden. It takes tremendous energy. And it is so lonely sometimes I can't think straight.But when I do that  keep him down  people love me. Except  that doesn't last. Because I tell myself it's only because they don't know. If they really saw this monster - they'd fear me. Judge me. Diminish me. Leave me.Most people are ok hearing you have a mental illness. They even ask about it. How are you doing? How is that mental illness? No one is ok seeing it. No one wants to see the monster.
