  It's not what you ask of your guests  it's how you do it.As a non-vegetarian  there are ways you might tell me this which would be fine and I'd say  no problem. And there are ways that would piss me off.You have a right to set the rules in your home and ask your guests to abide by them. And they have a right to reject those rules through the act of STAYING SOMEWHERE ELSE.But you also have a job as host to make your guests feel welcome. So when you tell them no meat in the house  try not to do it in a way that suggests they are morally inferior for eating meat.We don't eat meat because it's murder.
