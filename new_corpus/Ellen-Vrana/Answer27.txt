  You are asking if this POV-based structure (jumping between 1st person Points of View (POV)) is overdone  expected  or boring?The answer is no  not necessarily.That being said  it won't be original or inventive (The Memento boat of innovative structure just for the sake of structure has sailed  don't swim after it)  writing a book with a different perspective each chapter ISN'T a book idea. It's a structure/narration idea that you'd employ AFTER you've developed your book/thematic idea. It is also complicated to execute deftly.
