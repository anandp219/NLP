I communicated in French but it wasn't working until one of the guys called a friend who spoke Spanish. So I spoke Spanish to him on the phone  he relayed it to the mechanic in Arabic and the mechanic spoke back to me in French. I relayed it to my useless German-speaking husband in English.That was cool. Turns out we destroyed our timing belt during some unexpected off-roading from Fez to Marrakesh. And they couldn't fix it.
