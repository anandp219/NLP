She noticed that Harry had a quite disturbing tendency to run his fingers through his hair when he was nervous. I couldn't breath but for the noise of Harry running his goddam fingers through his motherfucking hair.Or the more direct approach  put it in dialog"If you don't stop running your fingers through you hair I'm going to hit you with a frying pan!" She screamed ; her red gums flashing. So  in sum. Don't repeat. If you have to repeat  do it simply and subtly only as much as you need and if it adds to what is most important in the scene.
