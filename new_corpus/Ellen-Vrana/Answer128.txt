Think about it  you deny you're cheating  you get mad at him  you emphatically tell him you're not cheating and that you love him. He feels like he's being noticed.He probably feels excluded from your life because you are working so much. He might feel like you've forgotten him or that you will  soon. These are normal feelings that couples go through and it doesn't mean he's insecure or crazy or that you are to blame.It just means you need to talk about it and address what is really going on.Don't talk to him about his paranoia  talk to him about what he's feeling.
