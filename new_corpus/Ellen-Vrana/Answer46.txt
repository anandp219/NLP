  One man's alone time is another man's social rejection.They aren't picking on introverts  they are reacting to introvert BEHAVIOR. Introverts seek alone time. From an extrovert's point of view it could feel like rejection. Explain your behavior without threatening or maligning theirs. Be specific about what you need and why (i.e. what it means for you and your energy) and even put it in their terms - how do they feel when they are alone  probably how you feel when you're with people. Help them see that.If they can't respect who you are apart from what it means about them  ignore them.
