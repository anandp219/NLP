We get it. 2. Separate your characters' behaviors between characteristics and actions and call attention to them as needed.A CHARACTERISTIC (or common behavior) is something that happens always because it is the character. Example: John smiled so wide he was more gum than tooth.That's visual  we'll remember. You don't have to remind us after your original description. If you feel this is critical to the character (although I don't know why it would be) and we might forget by page 300  have another character comment on it.An ACTION (uncommon behavior) is something that happens once (or several times in a scene but only in a scene) and is thus significant  a departure of our normal visual of this character.
