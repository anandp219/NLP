Or start with structure and use it to get creative.A few specific plot structures:http://www.writerstoauthors.com/...http://english.learnhub.com/less...Depending on whether you are a bottoms up or top down writer  either way might work (I'm a bottom's up - I generate creative flurry first  then fit it into a structure).Narrative voice -  Will this be in first person? From whose point of view? What are limits or bonuses of having either/or?Keep flushing these things out until you have pages of character information and backstory  a plot line on a wall with key turning points and changes  and lots of research that you probably won't ever use.And then  my friend  WRITE.
