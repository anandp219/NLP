The more you have  the harder it will be to keep them consistent and to make the characters rich  deep and developed. The fewer you have  the more you have to convince the reader that you need these two perspectives and not an omniscient POV which is easier to follow.Either way  I wouldn't use more than two 1st person POVs  it will give your reader whiplash. Any more than 2 and I'd switch to 3rd person POVs.Each character must have a strong  unique voice. Character voice is extremely hard for beginner writers  most of us churn out characters that are variations of our own voices/thoughts.
