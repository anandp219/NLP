Are there females writing  sure. But I haven't tried to find them. Maybe I should . . that doesn't make me sexist  just lazy.Words like "abuse  bullying  sexist  victim" have been overused by every last celeb-hopeful trying to get headlines. The power of these words has diminished and that affects the people who really need to use them. Sexist would be if you don't follow  read or like someone JUST BECAUSE a female authored it. Regardless of topic  writing  viewpoint  content - if it were written by a male  you'd like it.
