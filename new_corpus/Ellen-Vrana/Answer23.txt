They'd be wrong. I've met zero full-time writers who romanticize their careers. They love it  but they see it for what it is and do it because it's worth the costs. What are the costs? Why is writing as a career not as ideal as it seems?Creating is a small part of it. The rest of it  is administrative. Editing  typing  publicizing  communicating  studying  etc. People don't see what you do as a career. More like an overwrought hobby. We hear a lot of "What fun  I wish I could do that!' Well  you can.
