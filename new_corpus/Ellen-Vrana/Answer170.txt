Very cool.I also follow the rule that the people who raise the most stink about what is offensive to someone else (on things that really aren't that offensive) but can't tell you why it's offensive do so to hide the fact that they have no idea what they are talking about and have never actually interacted with someone of the supposed offended party in their life. These people suck. Ignore them.
