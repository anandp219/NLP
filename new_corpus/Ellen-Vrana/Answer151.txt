Many  many people have written on introversion. On Quora  in books  etc. Read up and send whatever you find interesting to the people who judge you.Try to separate those who care about you (and are worried because they don't understand and perhaps fear the worst) and those who are just being self-centered and judgmental. Attempt to make the first group understand (I'll talk to them if that would help!) and ignore the second group  as best you can. We all have people who will never understand us.
