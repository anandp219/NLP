  Every oak tree is gnarled. Every gentle wave is lapping upon the shore. Every mountain town is nestled in a valley  every chimney produces curled rings of smoke. Every politician is slick  every banker is soulless. Journalists are moral and hardworking. Teachers are worn out. Every woman is unsatisfied  every man is flippant. Mothers are worn out too  but the fathers are emotionless. Every woman has jet black hair and every day starts with bitter coffee (which might also be scorching) and ends with whiskey (who drinks whiskey?)
