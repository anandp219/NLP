  You should well ask and I know why you did  because in this answer I tell everyone to fail. (Except I didn't mean GO FAIL  I meant  GO SUCCEED without being afraid of failing. )I digress. Good question. I always feared after that post  people who read it were out there  failing  without a clue how to bounce back. It kept me up at night.And yet it took me weeks to answer this A2A because my immediate thoughts were - not joking - But  I've never failed!That's right  I'VE NEVER FAILED. I haven't.
