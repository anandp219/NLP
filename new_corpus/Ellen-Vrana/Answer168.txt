Political correctness  though clunky and annoying - is supposed to make our speech more neutral so we can avoid such misinterpretations when our intentions aren't clear. I'm not saying this is perfect  but it might have been better if your statement was more neutral "I could see someone mistaking you for a Latino" Rather than "You look Mexican." Does that feel right?I am not politically correct  not by a long- shot. To make up for that  I make my intentions clear  and leave room for doubt and discussion.
