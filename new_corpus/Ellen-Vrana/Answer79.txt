To me  it is me being considerate and loving but you can imagine how well that goes down with my friends. Not great.If they are really close to them  ask them how they'd want to be supported. What kind of things they'd need. Maybe talk about it not in the situation but when things are calm and normal.Get insight from this. Figure out how they want to be supported and that will give you clues as to how they are probably doing it for you. Maybe in ways you don't see. Try to recognize it.Consider your own habits and approaches.
