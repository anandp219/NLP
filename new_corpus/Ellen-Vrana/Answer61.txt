I.E. they will also hold you to a standard based on what THEY think you should know and be like and if you fail to meet their criteria  you will fall from their grace just as much as you would anyone's.Signal: I'm a doctorInterpretation: He's a doctor  he must be smart  hard-working  and care about helping others.Test: Doctor is at restaurant  someone is choking  Doctor doesn't know how to administer the Heimlich Maneuver or just decides he doesn't want to  everyone in restaurant and soon entire town hate said Doctor.In this case  the Doctor FAILED to meet expectations  and now no one gives two shits he's a doctor.Your brother can become a Doctor  but that alone won't get him lasting respect.
