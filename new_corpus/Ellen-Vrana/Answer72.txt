That's not why I mention it. My husband (a guy who I send to the garden for herbs and he returns EVERY SINGLE TIME with cuttings from each herbaceous plant EXCEPT herbs - I should cook geranium stems to teach him a lesson) also loved the book. Because it is superbly well-written.3. If you don't care  we won't care. Good writing doesn't just start well and end well  or have a good story  or humor or insight - it has an author's voice. An author's confidence and enthusiasm. Get excited about what you are writing about - whatever it is - and we'll get excited.Ok (now you say) but Ellen  what if nothing interests me?
