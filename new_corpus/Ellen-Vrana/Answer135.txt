*You can't never fully avoid "Wow  you've never seen XYZ??" So fucking annoying. I told an ex I hadn't seen Dune. 'Dune? You've never seen Dune?! How could you not see Dune?' Yeah well  Dune isn't a thing and now neither are we. Annoying. UNLESS the movie in question is the original Star Wars Trilogy and then you should be mocked  nay - thrown into a garbage masher on the detention level  if you haven't seen it. SW is the most available  most recognizable and most commonly watched movie of all time.
