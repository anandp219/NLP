I remove useless speech patterns  replace vocab  and improve the flow so my meaning is clearer. I call it de-cluttering.For example;It comes out of my head looking like this.Except it's not exactly how I would talk. After I write anything  I edit it many times. Among other things  I remove and replace useless words and phrases that are usually from my speech patterns and aren't necessary to what you're reading.After 4-5 rounds of edits  it becomes this;Except it's not exactly how I talk. After I write  I edit.
