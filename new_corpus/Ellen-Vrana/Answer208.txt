Once they see it  that's all they see. You can't put it back  you can't get them to see the normal you. It'll never be the same. Even the ones who say  no  I know  it's ok. I'll love you. You know they won't.So  what do you do? You ask about getting thicker skin. Which is  in a sense  building a stronger cage for the monster. That might work  and should work around random people - you have no need for them to affect you. You are paranoid that this person actually thinks you are crazy - he or she has no idea.
