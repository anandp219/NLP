Example: John felt sad. Susie gave him a confused look. Jane  shivered when she saw John's face. We only know what John thinks  but we have actions that suggest what Susie and Jane think.Considerations for using this narrative perspective- The more removed we are from a characters mind  the easier it is to add texture to the stories; things like scenery  atmosphere  mood  motifs etc. Long scenery descriptions in first person are weird  because most individuals don't survey scenery to the extent a 3rd person narrator would.- Allows for richer characters due to multiple points of view  reactions  thoughts and motivations.- Similarly  can add tension because reader can more clearly see the emotions of fear and anger - as well as situation irony that lead to tension.
