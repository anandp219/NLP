For one  it will affect the Quora employees  I can't imagine Marc Bodnick putting up with endless A2As  can you?- No  the biggest loss is to the community. It's a tear in the social fabric. A fabric that's stitched when I upvote you and you promote me and then we mutually exchange a PM or remember each other's avatars and follow each other. And multiply this by 100k a day so that we all feel connected here to something bigger. This bigger thing connects us to Quora far more than wanting to know the best answers on the internet.
