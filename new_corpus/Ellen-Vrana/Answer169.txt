Example: I visited a good friend of mine Vishwanath Ram in Texas. Vishy is Indian  he has tan skin  thick dark hair and he lives in a community where there are a lot of Mexican immigrants and citizens.I asked him if he was ever mistaken as Chicano (what local Mexican's call themselves) by locals and I didn't mean to offend him  I was just curious. This might be offensive to someone  but it wasn't to Vishy. (And if it was I hope he says in the comments).You asking this here  without prejudice  shows just the kind of openness I'm talking about.
