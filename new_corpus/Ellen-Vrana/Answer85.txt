People often complain about Catcher because of this  mistaking Holden's immature narration as a causality of bad writing.- It's difficult for new authors not to put their own voice into the characters. The character needs to have their own consistent vernacular and personality.- Rare  but what if your character dies? Story stops. Unless you pick it up with someone else or 3rd person but that is a big shift in the book.Examples of books that use 1st person narration well- The Catcher in the Rye (1951) is perhaps the best example.
