Some people don't. They and I both have the "you must win" voice. They simply don't have the brakes on it that I do. (Some folks naturally have control  but they browse the web drunk. Alcohol famously blunts our breaks. )I've never purposefully antagonized anyone on Quora. That is  I've never gone into an interaction with that goal. I've certainly said thing I knew would likely upset people  e.g. expressed views on religion  parenting  etc.  but never with the goal of upsetting anyone. So I haven't experienced anyone stalking me in retaliation for me constantly badmouthing him.But I have experienced it when I've refused to let another person win.
