  Because sight is more complex than we tend to think. Seeing an apple isn't something you just do with your eyes. Your eyes capture certain data  but by the time you become conscious of the apple  its image is enhanced or tarnished by all sorts of other data. If a perfect-looking apple smells bad  it will probably look less-than perfect to you. If I tell you it's actually a fake apple  and that it's made out of wax stuffed with fecal matter  it will look worse still. If you have a standard human brain  you won't just think  "It looks delicious  but it's actually disgusting."
