It's much harder if you've grown up with inches  feet  and pounds. The only truly difficult thing about Javascript  in my opinion  is its relative lack of community standards and standard libraries. There are often ten ways of doing the same thing  and if you ask ten JavaScript developers to tell you the best way  you'll get ten different answers**. This is true for many languages  but there tends to be more agreement--in  say  the Java and Python communities--about best tools and practices. This is all relative.
