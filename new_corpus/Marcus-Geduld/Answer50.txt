I know how to talk to my partner about problems. I know how to listen. I am willing to compromise. I am willing to seek outside help if necessary. If we had a big problem we couldn't solve  I wouldn't even spend a second "considering" couples therapy. I'd be on the Internet  looking for good therapists. There are hypothetical deal-breakers. If my wife started beating me and refused to stop  I'd leave her. If she continually lied to me  I'd probably leave her  too. But  in general  ending the marriage simply isn't on the table.
