  The ethics are the same regardless of sex. I am not allowed to lie to my wife. And according to my ethics  lying by omission counts as lying. (I can't excuse my behavior by saying  "She didn't ask.") There are no "she drove me to it" exceptions. I'm only allowed to use "drove me to it" when I'm trapped  and marriage is not a trap--at least not where I live. I am free to divorce my wife any time I want. (I also freely chose to get married in the first place.) It really doesn't matter what she does: yell at me all the time  refuse to have sex with me  cheat on me with 15 different men.
