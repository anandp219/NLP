)If I killed all my meat myself  mistakes like this would be extremely rare. They're already pretty rare  but they'd be rarer. Still  I'd probably stick to the same rules. If I was trying to kill a chicken and accidentally killed a cow  I would go ahead and eat it. What would be the point of letting it rot? (Though  again  the best option would be to give it to a hungry person.)
