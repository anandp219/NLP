If she didn't  there'd be no point to the marriage as far as I'm concerned. My mom wouldn't do this  but if she ever made a mean-spirited comment about my wife--or tried to come between us--I would instantly and definitely put a stop to her. "I love you  mom  but you need to stop saying stuff like that or we won't be seeing each other any more." And this would be a three-strikes-and-you're-out situation. My wife knows this. She knows she comes first with me. I know I come first with her. And no one's opinion of our marriage matters.
