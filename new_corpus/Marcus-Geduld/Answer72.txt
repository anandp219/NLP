Two Python programmers may well have profound disagreements  but it tends to happen much more often in the Javascript community. This is because JavaScript hasn't been taken seriously for much as-long-as most other popular languages. It's been around for years  but only a few as a language that interested professionals. So the situation is a little like English in Shakespeare's day  before spelling and grammar rules had been standardized. (Shakespeare spelled his own name in several ways! )Practiced JavaScript developers tend to love this flexibility.
