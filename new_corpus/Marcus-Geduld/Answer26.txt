It's impossible to be more specific  because people age at very different rates  and even two people aging at the same rate often look wildly different from each other  due to genetic differences  dietary differences  and so on. My friends (male and female) are mostly in their 40s  50s  and 60s  and it's amazing how varied they look. Some of the 60-year-olds look younger than some of the 40 year olds. I have friends from high school who still look pretty much like they did back then  35 years ago.
