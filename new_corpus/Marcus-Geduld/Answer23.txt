These are all life forms we've hugely altered through centuries of selective breeding. (Is a beaver's dam unnatural? After all  the beaver built it. It's an artifact. Or is it natural because something built by an animal is natural? If so  then a helicopter is natural  because it too was built by an animal--in this case a primate. )There are some "natural" things--things untouched by human hands--that you can experience if you want. You can  for instance  wait until lightning catches a forest on fire and then go running naked through the flames.
