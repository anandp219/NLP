  I always read the book first.Most people who have watched the movie version of their favourite book will claim that they liked the book better. This is because  inside their heads  they have already created the perfect version of the movie for themselves. And no matter how good / stunning / visually appealing the final product is  it can never live up to the perfect rendering inside their heads; the readers have internalized and visualized every word of the book to create a version tailor-made just for them.Also  films as a medium are inherently more restricting than books; they end up being a subset of the books in terms of plot and character development  richness of imagery  scope of visualization etc.
