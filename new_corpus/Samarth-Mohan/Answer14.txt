This is again a kindness he didn't forget.Post the rebellion  he joined the Kingsguard under King Robert. But he always had moral reservations about serving him. Most of his reservation for Robert stemmed from knowing that Robert had smiled when Tywin Lannister had presented him with the bodies of Rhaegar's children. Selmy thought that he'd never have served Robert and nothing on earth would have stopped him from killing Robert if he'd himself seen him smile. So Selmy was a reluctant participant in the Baratheon kingship  his real fealty always remaining with the Targaryens  slipping off to join his (metaphorical) forces with Danaerys at the first possible chance.So given his history with the Targaryens and his general sense of unwavering loyalty  Barristan Selmy feels guilty over not defending the Mad King; especially since it resulted in the death of his two kids as well.
