This significant pivot in the last decade is one key element in the resurgence of BJP. The pivot firmly rests on bringing minority caste in each state to power and weaken the grip of the majority castes. Thus  RSS put weight behind Modi in 2001 to weaken Patel control in Gujarat and later put weight behind Nitish Kumar [again from a minority caste] to weaken the Yadav base in Bihar. In UP they sacrificed some of their Brahmin votes to Mayawati to focus on the Dalits. In Rajasthan  they brought a non-Jat [Vasundra Raje] and in Maharashtra they brought a non-Maratha [Fadnavis] after a long time.
