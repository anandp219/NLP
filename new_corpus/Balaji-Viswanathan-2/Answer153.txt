  Around the world people do crazy things to appear attractive. The whole world of cosmetics and cosmetic surgeries would be out of business if people stopped being insecure of their beauty. Think of tanning salons  sunbathing  fairness creams  tattoos  skin piercing... people in every part of the world do dangerous things in their pursuit of beauty. And this didn't start in modern era  but is as old as human civilization. Tribes around the world have painted their faces in all sorts of fancy colors for ceremonial reasons as well as for aesthetic reasons.We probably carry innate animal tendencies to spend effort on looking for our mate and make ourselves attractive in the process.
