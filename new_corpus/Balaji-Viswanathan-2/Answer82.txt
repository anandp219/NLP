We will ban the entire diamond industry [double bonus  it is centered in Modi's state] and anyone wearing diamonds will be labeled as Modi bhakt. Finally  all Indian dance forms  music forms  drama arts should be banned near all government offices  because they all have their roots in religion. We should also take our lion emblem out  the national motto [Satyameva Jayate] and even the national flag because they all have religious symbols underneath.Secularism means a saint like Sankaracharya would not be passing laws in the Parliament  you will not be barred from becoming the head of the country merely because you are from religion X and the court would not punish you merely for not following a principle from Gita.
