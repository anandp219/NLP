I have not seen any celebrity  including Narayana Murthy who made a comment in NDTV to bring their set of recommendations on how to solve the problem. A protest needs a direction and an organization. There needs to be a list of demands. In case of "intolerance"  the demands could range from changing specific laws to asking for greater police/a special division to managing religious riots. What are the list of things the government must do to make India a tolerant nation? I don't see any credible list of demands.
