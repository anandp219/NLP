Conservatives typically come from the dominant groups for whom the present is convenient. Liberals often from the challenger groups for whom change is necessary. Thus  minorities and immigrants are often liberals while someone from a majority community is more likely to be a conservative. This is why an India who might be a liberal in the US might be conservative in India. Again  there are economic conservatives and there are social conservatives. Economic conservatives tend to come from economically dominant groups and social conservatives often come from socially dominant groups.
