If you could win such a war by book  it is good. But  if you cannot you should rather be willing to break the rules of engagement rather risk destroying the entire society. Yudhisthira did everything possible to follow every rule. He made sure he pleased everyone. He acted as a good king  a good brother and a courteous relative. Like every human he had his vices & temptations. By trying to please his cousins and avoid confrontations  he made everyone around him suffer.He lost the kingdom that was his right and was almost killed by his wicked cousins who tried to trap him in a house made of lacquer (Lakshagraha).
