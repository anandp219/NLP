  The Indo-Gangetic Plain that makes most of north India is the largest alluvial plain on entire earth. It spans some 630 million acres from the Indus to the Brahmaputra. It is watered by three great  independent  perennial river systems - Indus  Ganga and Brahmaputra. Within this Indo-Gangetic plain there is no major mountain range  forest  lake or other natural barriers to prevent a consolidation of power.When someone asks why north India has so much people or why so many empires grew there  the simple answer is that the spread of water and silt over such a large region is not seen anywhere on earth.
