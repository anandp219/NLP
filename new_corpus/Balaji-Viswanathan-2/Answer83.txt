But  it doesn't mean every element of Indian culture be removed from the public. Secularism primarily had its roots in Europe  where the Church historically had an outsized role. Indian religions don't have such a central church nor a powerful Pope and thus our Constitution was not written with the problems & paranoia of Europe in mind. Indian version of secularism is about tolerance and acceptance of all faiths like we always did through history  not a fanatic removal of cultural/historic symbols from public life.
