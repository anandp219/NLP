  Some do. In my school  we had mock stock trading  covering even some advanced topics like debentures/preferred shares as early as 9th standard. It depends on how motivated  skilled and passionate the math/social science teachers are. Why don't many others do it?There is not enough recognition on the importance of investing/finance among the teachers. Some see the topics related to finance as too materialistic. Academia has historically been left leaning and topics like finance are not seen worth of their time.
