It is fancy for an ascetic to preach morality  but for a commander in the battlefield to them all literally can be criminal. What if India's Chief of Army Staff drops all his weapons in the middle of the war just because some religious idea struck him? Would you not see that as a criminal negligence? He can be all religious in his own time  but in the battlefield his duty is to make sure India survives. Same for Arjuna.Dharma is about the preservation of righteousness in the society. A Dharma Yuddha is a war to protect that righteousness.
