  Imagine this scenario. An enemy nation is just about to launch a nuclear attack on India. A bomb is about to hit Mumbai and kill 10 million people. You are the Indian Prime Minister and the head of your spy agency brings you a plan to kill the opposite general who is about to press the button. If he is dead  the war would come to a halt. The plan is foolproof and you could kill the person & stop the bomb. But  the method is devious. Which is ethical here - letting your spy chief kill that general or letting the nuclear weapon destroy your largest city & all its people?
