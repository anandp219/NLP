They were so good at guiding that by the end of the first two weeks I was helping out with a couple of American citizens on some of the forms and key things related to the university. I could also save a big chunk of money at the end of the tax year knowing what deductions to claim. Some of my friends also got internships and assistanceships through the association. Although I notice that such camaraderie has gone down in the last decade due to a huge influx of Indian immigrants  it still exists.
