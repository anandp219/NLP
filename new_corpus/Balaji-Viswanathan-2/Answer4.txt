  Let's start with the assumption. Kashmiris Muslims hate India. Many do hate  but not all. What about the minority of Kashmiri Muslims that love India? What about their fate if the state is taken over by Pakistan? What about the fate of Kashmir's non-Muslims? The state of Jammu & Kashmir especially has large regions of Hindu and Buddhist populations whose fate is dreadful if India gives up the state. Protecting the millions of Kashmiris from chaos is what India wants. Because  we don't want another 1947 and another failed stated in the border.Why would India never give up Kashmir?The state of Hindus and Buddhists in Pakistan are far worse than the state of Muslims in India.
