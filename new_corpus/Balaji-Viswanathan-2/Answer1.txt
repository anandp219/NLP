  It is an outdated theory that refuses to die. The idea is that there was a huge lost continent south of Tamil Nadu. While many civilizations believe in such submerged islands [Atlantis]  the sheer size & imagination of Lemuria is massive. If it were a country it would probably be the second largest. When I was a school kid I too fantasized about that after being misinformed by some of my school teachers. The idea was invented in the 1860s when an English zoologist noted that there were these monkeys called Lemur that were found in Madagascar  India and some parts of South East Asia.
