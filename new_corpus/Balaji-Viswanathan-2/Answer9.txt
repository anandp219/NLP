And the war was not just in Bengal  but all over South Asia. India even had to cover up Taj Mahal as Pakistan jets tried to hit Agra. It was the only time India lost a warship as INS Khukri (F149) was sunk with 176 sailors. India has done such sacrifices during that war and taking India's name out of that war is sheer insensitive for any Bangladeshi. In short  there was a Bangladeshi civil war for the most part of 1971 and then a direct Indo-Pakistan war at the end of it. Both are important and related  but different.
