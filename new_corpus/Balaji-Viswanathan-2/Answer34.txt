However  that didn't turn out to become a reality. Mujibur was never allowed to become the Prime Minister as the national assembly meeting [Parliament] to have these elected representatives vote their PM was postponed. By March  4 months after the elections  the Awami league grew impatient and launched a non-cooperation movement. In response  Pakistan's President Yahya Khan imposed a martial law and a brutal repression of the Bengalis [especially the Bengali Hindus and Bengali intelligentsia] termed the Operation Searchlight.On 25th March  Mujib was arrested and taken to West Pakistan.
