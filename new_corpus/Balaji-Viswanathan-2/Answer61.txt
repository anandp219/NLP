Thus  many Indians ask the help of their parents to help with the kids. Locals too have huge trouble managing kids without nannies  but they have a wider support network [parents  siblings  friends  cousins] locally while Indians in US often have none. In summary  it is not about daily chores there is a problem. It is in raising kids where expat Indians often face a pain. Kids are lovely  but also take up a lot of energy to manage.
