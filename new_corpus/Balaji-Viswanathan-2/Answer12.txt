Cities are in general wealthier than the countryside. If Mumbai and Shanghai were counted as independent countries  they have a higher GDP than Singapore and Hong Kong compressed in a comparable geographic area. List of cities by GDP. Does that mean Mumbai and Shanghai are better than Singapore and Hong Kong? By being counted in larger nations with much higher rural population their GDPs are sometimes less appreciated.Thus  it is not about being a small country or a large country. It is about being a city sitting in an important trade route vs. a rural region stuck somewhere.
