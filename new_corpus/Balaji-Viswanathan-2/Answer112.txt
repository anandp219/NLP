After years of spending as a commoner he came back with power of Panchalas. His cousins cheated him with an infertile part of the kingdom with no city. Yudhisthira built a city and made the region into a prosperous one. He then went to please his cousins and lost everything. After in exile for 13 years  he came back to get his due right  but was not given. He went as low as getting 5 villages  but even that was not given. Yudhisthira - the epitome of perfection and goodness was losing because he was too inflexible to break the rules.
