The next experience come from the location. Cities are often fast changing and city economies are built around profiting on change. The presence of a new tech is more like to change the city faster than a village. Thus  city residents are more likely to be liberal [if everything else is equal]. On the other hand  rural residents are more likely to be conservative as change comes less. Not all changes are positive though. City residents are also more likely to get into silly fads too for the same reason.The third experience comes from identity.
