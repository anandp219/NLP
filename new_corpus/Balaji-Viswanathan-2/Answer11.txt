  Let's separate Qatar & Brunei from Luxembourg  Singapore  Hong Kong  Liechtenstein etc. Qatar has the world's third largest deposits of natural gas and has less than 300 000 citizens. If you divide that large a resource among that small a population you get crazy high income. Apart from the energy  it doesn't have any important industry worth mentioning. Brunei is somewhat close to that description.Regarding Singapore  Hong Kong  Luxembourg etc they are trading cities sitting next to massive countries.
