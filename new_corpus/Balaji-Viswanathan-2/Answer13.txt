Singapore is a small rich city-state in an important trade route while Nauru is a small poor rural nation that has no such benefit. In the same way  USA is an large rich urbanized nation with massive amount of trade while India is a large poor rural nation with far less trade. While we should surely learn a lot from Singapore and Hong Kong  we should also make sure we are comparing apples vs apples - Singapore vs commercial cities in a country than the entire country itself.
