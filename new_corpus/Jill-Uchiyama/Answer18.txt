Sleeping is not the same as meditating even though you can lose all trace of time in both.If you are sleeping  you may just want to try a shorter meditation and see if you can stay alert and awake for the whole time. Also  try to set a soft bell or alarm at the end of your meditation so you do not fall asleep and go over the hour. There are some great apps (such as Insight Timer)that can provide singing bowls and they make great alarms at the end of the session.
