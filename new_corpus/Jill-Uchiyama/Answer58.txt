He moved objects without touching them  bent spoons by just twirling them  and levitated cigarettes and other objects. He was good. Really good at this.I was at several of his shows and he would literally scare people some people to death. His shows defied all reason and logical thinking. They were filled to the brim of acts that would make the hair on your arm stand up. And some of his so-called tricks were so elaborate  no one could figure out how he did it without having some kind of special powers.I witnessed people actually get angry during his show and run out the door.
