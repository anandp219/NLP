This friend  your friend  lives inside of you- at some point along the way  and it's hard to define when- you really merged into one luscious person. Your good friend is not someone you have to explain much to- they already internalize your life's story. They get it. It's like they become a song in your head- one that you know the lyrics to- one that you pull out and play again and again. There is trust. There is celebration when good things come their way. They are on FB liking all of the important posts and pushing you to break up with that jerk that's treating you wrong- all the while understanding your feelings and needs.The good friend is like nothing else in life.
