Your saliva puts you on the map. For a small amount of money (these days)  you can get tested and 23andMe will illuminate your DNA history in a way that nothing else can. I had no knowledge of my ancestry and now know more than I could ever have imagined. The test allows you to peer back- 40 000 years into your distant past- where your haplogroup which is a distinct set of people who share the same DNA as you do  originated. You will find out what your haplogroups are  where your origins come from  and you will probably  like many of us  be surprised by the findings.I highly recommend this.
