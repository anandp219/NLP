  First  let's establish this point: Japan ranks among the top ten countries with the highest suicide rate. It is the leading cause of death for men between 22-44. On average  70 suicides happen every day in Japan  most of them are men. Suicide is definitely a prominent theme in Japan  it is a go-to solution when all else seems to fail. It includes the value of self-sacrifice  which is a highly Japanese value in a society that emphasizes group harmony and cooperation over individuality.The main reasons in recent years for suicide have to do with younger men not being able to find work  lay-offs or firings  and general economic issues.
