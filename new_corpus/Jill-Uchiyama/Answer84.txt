Writing is my thing. Other things  not so much. But what I cannot say is that this makes me someone that stands out as special  privileged  or better than others. Everyone likes to feel special  and there are all kinds of ways to do that. I can use my Top Writer badge to bolster my self esteem on days that I really need it. When I feel insecure  I can remember a compliment I've gotten and feel a bit better. I'm sure there is something you can use as well. But that way of relating to oneself always falls short.
