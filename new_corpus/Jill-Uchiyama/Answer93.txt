  The fact that you're this confused  insecure  and uncertain and that this guy has got you into such a tail-spin about who you even are  suggests that you probably have some important inner and personal work to do. Leave him out of it. As you say  he's got his issues and is probably far from being ready for a mutually loving relationship. But he came along for a reason- and you jumped on this bandwagon and even considered marriage with someone who became abusive to you and pointed you directly to your own insecurities.
