For an extravagantly interesting experience  go have a beer at Kitaichi Hall located in the glass building. This captures the mood and feeling of Otaru so well- dreamy and romantic.Otaru offers the best of what other great cities offer in Japan  with the flair of Hokkaido style  weather  and cuisine. In one of the coldest areas of Japan  it is perfect as a snowy backdrop to the otherwise humid Honshu island  or a beautiful way to cool off during a visit in the summer. A must see!
