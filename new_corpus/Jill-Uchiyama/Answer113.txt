During the years I worked in London  the pound doubled my dollar. In Tokyo  the dollar nearly doubled my yen.In terms of diversity  it is hard to say which is more diverse. Tokyo has a replica of the Eiffel Tower. London has... well.. Big Ben. For the best food in Tokyo  go Japanese. For the best food in London  go Japanese (or Indian).In London  rioting on the streets helped remove Magaret Thatcher. In Tokyo  rioting is not necessary due to professional suicide.In both London and Tokyo people regularly get pissed drunk.
