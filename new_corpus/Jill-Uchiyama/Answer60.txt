  I was walking around at my lunch hour in Boston feeling kind of depressed  feeling like I needed some uplift- someone who could set me straight  give me something to think about  raise my spirits. I took out my cell and began imagining that maybe  I could talk to anyone in the world at that moment. I asked myself the question  "if you could talk to anyone in the world right now  in the history of the world  who would it be?" The answer was Maya Angelou.I pressed the phone to my ear as I walked up and down the streets of Chinatown.
