And so  loving oneself or even hating oneself is irrelevant- because it has nothing to do with a self possessed  conscious form of behaving morally  truthfully  faithfully  or bestowing goodness upon your beloved.On the other hand  truly staying loving  committed  and acting in the best possible way on behalf of your beloved  requires great love for oneself. When we love ourselves  when we respect ourselves  and when we care about how to conduct ourselves as fully loving people  we must know firsthand what that means  and above all else  value it.
