This is quite curious in a country which is considered the 3rd wealthiest in the world. While businessmen have routinely thrown themselves under trains  or gone off to the forest to die  they have also been found dead in twos or threes- hanging in hotel rooms. Figuring that they are worth more dead than alive  salarymen cut the cord of their own lives and simultaneously throw a rope out to their families who will prosper from insurance money once they are gone.It is the responsible thing to do.The culture of self-sacrifice runs deep.
