Just for the clips of Amy's performances alone  this film is worth every penny.The least interesting part of the film is her obsession with Blake  who at first leaves her for his ex-girlfriend  and then later comes back to marry her. He introduces her to heroin and crack and all things poisonous and their co-dependent relationship feeds a kind of brokenness in her as their wounds meet. Many of her songs are about Blake  including one of her biggest hits "Back to Black." The lyrics shock like ECT.
