  It goes back to tribes. And luckily now that we have DNA websites which allow us to find out what haplogroups we belong to  we can now know what our original tribes were. This is where things get really interesting for us: finding out where we originated.You see  I do not think this is just a Caucasian American thing  but a human thing. Americans may be more prone to wanting to find out because our country is so young  and because our lineages are much vaster than we ever thought. Knowing what nationalities you belong to is a right.
