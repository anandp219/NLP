Her personal story is one of a shy girl with a gift for singing and writing poetry. She is pained from her parents' rocky marriage  when at age 9  her personality changes tremendously like the gradual piercings and tattoos that cover much of her body. As the eyeshadow curves and the hair piles higher and higher  her celebritydom emerges like the most unusual lyrics in her songs. It all happens fast. And when she delivers the poetry  it is through a body and soul which sends each melismatic syllable into you  like a shot right into your bloodstream.
