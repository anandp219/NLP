And as you look at this lovely thing  this piece of nature  let your mind be still for once today  on this day where nothing seems to be going the right way. Just still it as you meditate upon this piece of nature  this work of art that is your friend  or that sun- whatever. And then tell yourself these words  "It stops here because I say so." And to seal the deal  look some more- until you are ready to start your new day. No matter how bad things seem  it doesn't get to be bad unless we allow it to.
