  It was a book I was compelled to underline  thoughtfully  and yet I wept over its pages for 5 straight years. I read it every March. It was more than a book to me but a witnessing of both the depths of the worst human behavior imaginable delivered by the gentlest  most poetic voice I had ever read. The book that changed my life was Night by Elie Wiesel.As a young woman  I first learned of Elie Wiesel when he delivered a keynote speech at a family therapist conference I was going to. The speech was on "morality in psychotherapy."
