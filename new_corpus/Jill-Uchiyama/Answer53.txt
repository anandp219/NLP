Do you get why so many people are dying over this?The only good thing that comes from this story is that bandwagon of millions of people who feel this pain  who shudder at the site of Cecil's beautiful form when they see his videos  who have felt sick about this atrocity. Apparently  this story cuts close to the bone for many people. It's a lion. A beautiful animal who had a story. Most humans have respect and awe for such an animal.Human atrocities are also real and up front in the media. Caring about Cecil's death does not negate caring about other serious topics of the day.
