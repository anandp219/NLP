In almost all cases  an arranged marriage is seen as a ticket for the boy's parents to retire comfortably without worrying about cleanliness  food and grand-children  just because the bride is expected to single-handedly look after all of family's needs. What would you compare these with? Don't think too much  there is nothing. I believe the least you can do is to provide her financial security in the strange-land.In an institution of arranged marriage  where both the parties have very limited time to make decisions  compatibility is primarily judged on quantitative factors like salaries  education and degrees and to some extent on accepted questions on hobbies and family background and not-so-accepted questions like "Are you willing to leave your job and stay at home".
