  One of the most beautiful shloka of Ramayana goes like this:raamam dasharatham viddhi maam viddhi janaka aatmajaam |ayodhyaam aTaviim viddhi gaccha taata yathaa sukham || 2-40-9In this Sumitra  mother of Lakshman  tells him:Know and understand that Ram is like your father Dashratha  in Sita (Janaki) you would find me  the forest is your home Ayodhya  so hey my dearest son Lakshman  a great farewell to thee.Sumitra selflessly convinces Lakshman that he should leave her to join his Rama in his 14 years of exile.
