Washington was left with paralyzing brain injury which resulted him not being able to walk or talk. The people again started whining  "We told so"  "Stupid dream" and so on. They even recommended to stop the project since only the Roebligs knew how to build it.But Washington knew that a dream is not that one sees while sleeping  it is the one that doesn't let one sleep. He still had a burning desire to complete the project. All he could move was his finger  and he made best use of it - he developed a code of communication with his wife.
