You feel really happy while learning guitar in pursuit of your hobby  but when you see someone else performing on stage  you immediately get dissatisfied. The following quote beautifully summarizes how to pursue real happiness.Dont rely on someone else for your happiness and self-worth. Only you can be responsible for that. If you cant love and respect yourself  no one else will be able to make that happen. Accept who you are  completely; the good and the bad  and make changes as YOU see fit  not because you think someone else wants you to be different.
