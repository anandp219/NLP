Following her dharma to restore balance  Goddess Parvati created Ganesh through her powers whose objective was to bring wealth and prosperity in the world (that's why we associate riddhi-siddhi and shubh-labh with his name). After some time  when Parvati came to know that Shiva is returning  she decided to take a special Suchita bath and dress up to meet him. She instructed Ganesha that no-one should be allowed to enter the chamber.Now Shiva came and went straight to meet his beloved wife after such a long time  only to be stopped by Ganesha.
