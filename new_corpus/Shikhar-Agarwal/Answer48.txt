  I don't think so. Even if they are  it's only skin deep.Using Facebook and Twitter  taking photos from DSLRs  clicking selfies from iPhones  boozing and clubbing on weekends  gym-ing and so on are what I refer to as "skin deep modernism" or what is famously called "Aping the West". And this is what the youth is doing. They are blindly adopting only those things which they can see - in movies  news  etc - and term this as being modern. These things are a part of a lifestyle that has been derived from modern advancement  they are an an indication of modernity  not modernity itself.
