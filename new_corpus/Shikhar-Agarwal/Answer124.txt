Having a doubt is like having a car - just having it would not take you to the destination; you have to fill-in the fuel  take it to services  and actually drive it. Realization of truth is a journey  a journey which involves various failures  injuries  sometimes you would need to sleep on the ground  with empty stomach  you have to ignore what people think of you and so on. For this  you need energy  dedication and hard-work.Buddha was terribly influenced seeing all the people suffering around him.
