They were actually working hard in related fields  thinking about the issues 24x7 and perhaps had attempted 1000 other things and failed before they "had a lucky accident" or "got the answer in the dream".So if you want to get lucky  work hard  keep a positive attitude  learn from failures and iterate over them quickly. If you just sit and wait for luck  you would be alone forever. The fact is that luck is waiting for you round the corner  and its upto you how fast you run towards it.
