Your anger hurts others and leaves a sour impression that lasts forever.Each time you get angry  "hammer a nail". Simplest thing you can do is to carry a pocket diary and put a line each time you get angry. Then at night  count the number of lines for that day. If you make this a habit  each time you would get angry  you would be reminded to note it down. Indirectly  you would also realize that you getting angry. And because you are conscious and aware at that time  you would find it easier to control your actions and subdue anger.I hope the day comes soon when you don't have any line in your diary.
