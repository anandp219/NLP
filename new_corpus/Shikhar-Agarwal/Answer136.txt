  Consider a bird. When it is a baby  it resides in the nest and cannot fly. Its parents bring food for it. So it generally develops a psychological dependence that must be overcome. Parent birds begin to teach them flying by remaining a short distance away during feeding - so the baby bird has to step away from the nest  and "fly" towards the food. In the initial stages  it falls many times  but eventually spreads its wings to conquer the mighty sky. (Flying on the wings of vulnerability)Each child that is born is like a baby bird  which has the potential to fly high and explore the hidden treasures of the world.
