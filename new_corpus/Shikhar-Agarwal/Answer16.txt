  They start pursuing "sources" of happiness rather than happiness itself A very common example is money. You think money would give you happiness. It surely can  but the problem arises when you start to pursue money itself rather than happiness. You ignore your friends and loved ones  lose your health and in the end miss all the opportunities where it could have given you happiness. Similarly  you get obsessed by smart phones  social media  etc. The "sources" of are just the means  not happiness itself.
