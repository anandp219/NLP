The tactics  the actions  the karma was done so as to suit the scenarios. Ram was a warrior in the battle  Krishna was a guru and strategist. Ravana  Drona  Bhishma  Karna  etc had to be killed by different ways  and hence same tactics were not possible to apply. While Ram is known as maryada-purshottam  the epitome of dharma  Krishna is sometimes seen as adopting seemingly unfair means [1]. So they "changed colors" according to the situations  but the driving principles were the same.So in your life  keep your principles strong.
