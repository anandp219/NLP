  The simplest strategy to follow would be the following: Anytime you are doing something involving other people  ask yourself - "If others do the same for me  would I like it?" If the answer is no  you are not following dharma.Any action you are performing in general  ask yourself - "If I was earning 10 times less  had a smaller car  was living in half the size of my current house  in short was less fortunate and had a lower so-called social status  would I like that thing to be done?" If no  you are again against your dharma.I wish I could give you a more concrete answer.
