  They don't get offended by the words "Green Diwali" but by the hypocrisy of those who urge them.These people leave their car engines on while they enjoy the AC when parked  burn garbage comprising plastics on streets  release toxic industrial gases into the atmosphere without proper treatment and provide 1000s of reasons not to bike or take public transportation while going to work everyday. They constantly honk unnecessarily while driving even when it is a red light or they are near a school or a hospital  and don't provide earmuffs to their employees while they are working everyday near noisy machines.
