Becoming modern requires an evolution - in thoughts  education and implementation. It requires deliberate and conscious efforts to get to the root cause of change. Modernity will come when youth would start questioning "Why" and "How" to what they see  and not just adopt these and stop. The evolution process has started  but there is still time before I can say that the youth today is becoming "modern".
