I forgot the books!Professor: Couldn't you have said the easy term straightaway? !- Bollywood movie 3 IdiotsThe above dialog beautifully captures the essence of my answer. If you today Hinduism topic to be called Sanatan Dharma  or start calling Krishna and Rama as bhrahman  majority of the people won't be able to even read it  forget about the understanding. If you talk about Hindu/Indian mythology in East or West  people directly associate these with Ramayana  Mahabharata etc. And so is vice versa.
