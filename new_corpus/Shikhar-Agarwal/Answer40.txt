  I put "Idol worship is not permitted in Hinduism" in Bing Translate  and after a chain of multiple languages  English->Bulgarian->..->Chinese->..->Danish  the final result was  "In the Hindu ban on worship"! !So consider this hypothetical case: An old learned sage tells his young student  "Idol worship is permitted in Hinduism". A devotee comes to the student's house and asks him about his views on idol worship to which the student replies  "Idol worship is permitted  but not necessary." Like in Chinese-Whisper game  the devotee who was half-listening  thinks that what he heard was "Idol worship is not permitted" and writes this in a book.
