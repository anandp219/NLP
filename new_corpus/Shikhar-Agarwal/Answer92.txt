  Of course! It was much more.When Lakshman comes to meet his mother Sumitra before leaving for the forest  she tells him the following:raamam dasharatham viddhi maam viddhi janaka aatmajaam |ayodhyaam aTaviim viddhi gaccha taata yathaa sukham || 2-40-9"My dear Lakshman  know that Ram is like your father Dashratha  in Sita (Janaki) you would find me and the forest is like your home Ayodhya. May your stay be wonderful  farewell to you! "So in the forest  the relationship between Sita and Lakshman was that of a mother and son  which is much  much more than any in-law relationships.
