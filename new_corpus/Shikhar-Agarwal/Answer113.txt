  There once lived a boy who had a bad temper. He would get angry at every little thing. One day  his father gave him a bag of nails and told him  "Every time you get angry  hammer a nail into that front wall. "And so the activity started. On the first day  the boy hammered 50 nails. The next day  he hammered 40. Each time he used to go there  he repented being angry - it was quite a challenge to hammer a nail into that damn brick wall! Slowly  he discovered that controlling anger was easier than hammering  and the number of nails hammered started going down.Eventually  a day came when he didn't get angry  and he felt the joy of it.
