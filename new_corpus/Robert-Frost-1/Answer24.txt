  Dead Poets Society (1989) - Robin was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for this film that spoke to my generation. I dont know how objective my opinion of the film is  because it affected me so much while I was still a kid. I saw it the year before going away to university and I so imagined that the university experience would be full of instructors like the character Williams plays. It was heartbreaking to find that wasnt the case.Boys  you must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer you wait to begin  the less likely you are to find it at all.
