  I can't imagine any other actor portraying Steve Rogers and Captain America with such verisimilitude.From the his first scene  we can see the determination  goodness  and spirit in the scrawny kid from Brooklyn. When Dr. Erskine says to Steve  "The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So  good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man  who has known power all his life  will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength  and knows compassion.
