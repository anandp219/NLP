  The story doesn't explicitly say. Dickens wrote the story in 1842-1843 and it was published for the 1843 Christmas season. The only mention of time in the story is when Scrooge asks the Ghost of Christmas Present "Have you had many brothers  Spirit? and the Ghost responds More than eighteen hundred." Since we know there is a new Ghost of Christmas Present each year  we know the story takes place more than 1800 years after the birth of Christ.The easiest assumption is to assume the story takes place on Christmas Eve 1843.
