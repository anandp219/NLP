  There was one American onboard ISS on that day  NASA astronaut Frank Culbertson. Frank had been tasked with collecting medical data on the crew. When he called down to the ground to report that data over a privatized loop  the flight surgeon explained to him what had happened. The event had a personal connection to Frank. A friend and Naval Academy classmate was the airline pilot of the plane that hit the Pentagon.Soon after completing that conversation  the ISS passed over New York and Frank went to the window and captured photographs and video of the burning towers.
