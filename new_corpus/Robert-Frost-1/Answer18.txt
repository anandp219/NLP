That means they will probably feel compelled to be involved in the show in an editorial way. That didn't work out to well last time. I would much rather a company like Netflix was producing the series. Netflix appears to be much more comfortable allowing creative people to tell their stories the way they want to tell them.I'm very curious to know what the concept will be. It won't be Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock. Will it be the Enterprise? Will it be a starship on a five year mission? Will it be set in interstellar space or will it be set on a planet or starbase?The series I would like to see would go back to Gene Roddenberry's initial inspiration.
