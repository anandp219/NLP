Having to make space for hundreds of consultants that are rarely in the office seems like an expense that can be spared.Creativity. The first company that I worked for that had hot-desking was a management consultancy. I was working as a Graphics Specialist and had an allocated seat  but the consultants didnt. The official line was that hot-desking was proved to increase creativity. Youre forced out of your routine by sitting near other people. Im not sure if this really works out in reality though.Exposure to different people  widening the employee network.
