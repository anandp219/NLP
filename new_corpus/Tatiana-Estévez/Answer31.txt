I think this also will depend on how you view this as well  are you proud to show off your body and have art created from it - many people would be  or do you see this as something embarrassing and slightly shameful to pose nude for money? Social media has made this world a lot smaller and harder to hide from than it used to be. If you're going to do something you're not proud of  make sure there is no one around getting evidence.
