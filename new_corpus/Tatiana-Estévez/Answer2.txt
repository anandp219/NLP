All content and users can be reported on Quora  using the in-product reporting function. However I appreciate that sometimes reporting in situations like this doesn't feel like enough  particularly when the comment in isolation of any context doesn't appear to violate BNBR (it does! )  or sometimes you may just want to give some explanation  that when you can contact me. Feel free to email me at moderation@quora.com for any issues of other users 'hitting on' users  or anything related.EDIT: I found out who it was  yes they were banned.
