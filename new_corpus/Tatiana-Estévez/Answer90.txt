I say tea  but everyones order will be different  sugar  sweetener  semi-skimmed milk  skimmed milk  soya milk  maybe a few sneaky coffees for those continentals or American influenced people  definitely a few herbal teas and not to mention all the cheeky please fill up my water bottles'. Tea rounds often seem to catch people by surprise: 'Oooh tea  should I? Ooh I dont know  Ive had 12 already today  ooh go on then  if you insist  you devil ... hahaha  Ill get the biscuits out'. These people are liars  theyve been desperate for a tea for half an hour but they didn't have the time to do a tea round for 10 people.
