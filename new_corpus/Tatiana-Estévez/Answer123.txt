Having said that not every promotion cycle had new products. Generally a new product line would be added a couple of times of year  but this wasnt a fixed number. New colours were introduced more often. No fixed amount and I never counted but most promotion cycles had a few new colours. These promotion cycles were based on the promotion cycles of Boots a significant customer for all the budget to mid-priced cosmetics companies and we all followed this cycle  with a similar pattern of promotion.
