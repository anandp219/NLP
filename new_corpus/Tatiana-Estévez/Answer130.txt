Yeah I know you didnt ask for that  but he really really wants to give you that product. My job would be to just convince him to also mention what theyve actually specified  in sub-section 15.Not knowing the specifics of what the client wants. So your client wants a holiday  but where to  for how long  sunny or snowy  how many other people are going? Oh youre not going to say  you want us to guess. Smart  because we cant really give you a price without this information but youve stipulated that costings must be provided and the deadline for questions has now passed and the bloody consultant who was supposed to ask you this information for some reason didnt and now were petrified of over-pricing ourselves.
