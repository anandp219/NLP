All it is  is a less glamorous beauty  which makes it seem more of an achievable kind of beauty.When it comes to really changing how women value themselves  I don't believe these ads make a blind bit of difference. This is not how you gain true confidence about your looks  you can't get this from a bottle of body lotion or being forced to carry a label for your looks. You get it when you stop caring about whether or not youre beautiful and get it when you actually just like how you look  flaws and all.
