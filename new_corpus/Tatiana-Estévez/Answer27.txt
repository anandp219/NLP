I can only assume I would have gotten the promotion if I managed to increase our chargeable work whilst maintaining an antagonistic relationship with my internal clients. Despite all this I did eventually do fairly well and I even got to work a year abroad. Unfortunately at this time I also had to move flat in England and I had some issues with my expense receipts for my phone bills. I explained this issue to the Project Director and was told that this wasnt a problem  I could submit my expenses in the new year.
