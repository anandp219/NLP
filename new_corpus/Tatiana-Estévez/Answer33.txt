So the real statement being made here is if you are already quite good looking you should own it and embrace it. What about women that are less conventionally beautiful  200lbs overweight with a heart of gold or a woman with chronic acne who looks after the elderly  why arent they being shown embracing their beauty  why not show them being dragged through the beautiful door by their mums and friends  giggle  arent I cute because Im so humble and self-deprecating and chose the average door despite looking like a model.
