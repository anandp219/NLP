If you actually like this person very much you should write something pretty insulting in the card to express familiarity. For example if a woman is going on maternity leave  you should feign surprise and make a pointed remark about her putting on weight. What woman wouldnt be moved to tears at that heart-warming comment? Before passing that envelope to the next person  give it a little jiggle. Does it make a noise? Then get your wallet out and put some money in. Please no complaints about how you always have to donate to these things.
