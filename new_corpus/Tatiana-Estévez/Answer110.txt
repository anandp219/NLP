Having said that  more and more perfumery now uses synthetic fragrances as they are becoming fantastically sophisticated and can produce some amazing aromas. Even cheaper perfumes that aren't fake  will still usually either be a single note or top note. If they do have medium or base notes  they won't be as pleasant or as sophisticated as more expensive fragrances. As I said  none of these are definite indicator of cheapness  Chanel No.5 is a single note fragrance  but is not cheap and it is also possible to make a sophisticated non-sweet smelling cheap fragrance (although if I'm honest I personally find Chanel No.5 a trifle cheap smelling if not actually inexpensive).
