I remember one day I had several deadlines due for that day  and someone came to me to push for one more piece of work. I reviewed their work compared to the work of the others and as it was not client facing for that day  so I decided it that it would have to wait. They went straight to my boss  who insisted it got done. I got it done  and 5 minutes after getting it done  I fainted and had to be sent home in cab. Luckily someone advocated on my behalf and we finally got a replacement for the part-time worker we had lost the previous year.Although I increased our chargeable work by a significant amount and changing us from a cost centre to a profit centre  there was no credit given to me  and all of this was dismissed as me being a social butterfly who had the consultants eating from the palms of my hands.
