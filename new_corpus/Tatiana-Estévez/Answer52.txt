To really set yourself out on the right path  the first step is that you need a degree. I'm not saying it is impossible to do without a degree  but you're 16 and there is no reason to skip this step at this stage of your life. Although at 16 you're not quite ready  so make sure you do well in your A-Levels. As you live in London the clear choice is the University of Arts London (UAL). UAL has two colleges that have undergraduate fashion design courses  Central Saint Martins (famous alumni: Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney) and the London College of Fashion (famous alumni:Jimmy Choo).
