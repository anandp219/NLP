The Difference to the Vendor/SupplierTo the company making the proposal there should be less difference. If you're asked to bid for a specific thing  then yes you should always bid for that specific thing. However if you have a better solution  then that shouldn't stop you from trying to weave that into your proposal just because they haven't asked for alternatives. If you have an opportunity to discuss with the client upfront though  do this. If this is coming from a big company  the chances are you're also working via a procurement team and procurement teams frequently have a generic process that covers everything from finding the best company to supply their toilet paper to the people they're going to choose as their RemCo executive compensation advisors.
