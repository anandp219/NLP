Just smile noncommittally when this is going on and dont be pulled in.Sick leaveSick leave in the UK is generous and most companies will pay you as normal and up to quite a significant amount of time. Some people really abuse this  therefore any sickness is viewed with suspicion. Here are some of the more important rules:Being sick on a Monday is an absolute no-no as people will assume youre still hungover from the weekend. The exception here is if youre actually still hungover from the weekend  then you might as well just take the time off.Being sick on a Friday is an absolute no-no as people will assume youre hungover from the Thursday drinks and/or you just want a long weekend.
