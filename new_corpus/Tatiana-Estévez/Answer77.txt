Many women don't like to change their bag on a daily basis  so try and play it safe with a neutral bag. I think this can work  but black isn't a great choice for this unless you only wear black shoes. A better choice for a neutral colour is brown or beige. As with any fashion rule  you should feel free to break it  but only when you know it well enough. Just breaking it because you through on whatever that morning  is not going to make you look stylish.
