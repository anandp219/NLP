I asked my line manager what she thought was happening and how I could improve how I communicated. Her response Did all the other men in the meeting happen to be men?. Well yes indeed they were and I was then told to get used to it. Strange as it may seem the examples for this last company are just more numerous because I actually liked this company the best and stayed there the longest. There were definitely good aspects to working for them  but this is the worst of it.
