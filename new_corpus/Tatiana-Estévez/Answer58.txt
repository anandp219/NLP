  I'm really sorry if you have had this experience on Quora. This is completely unacceptable and in no way tolerated  it violates Quora's Be Nice Be Respectful policy on several levels. Unfortunately although we have zero tolerance for this behaviour it is incredibly difficult to actually prevent it  however when it does occur we will action this as a priority once we know about it. You can report any content like this as 'Disrespectful/Harassing Content: Adversarial towards a person/group. '  however because of the severity of this issue and the impact it can have for women  if you have the time please do message me or email me at moderation@quora.com so that I can immediately ban them or if they're anonymous I can revoke their ability to continue to add content anonymously.
