The thing is recruiters and HR people need to have as much quantifiable criteria as possible. For them being able to tick the list of software skills needed on their candidate list is a great thing to go back to a head of department with. Yet in reality software is changing all the time  the true skill needed is someone who can pick new software quickly  there have been several occasions when Ive been asked if knew software x when going for graphics/DTP roles.
