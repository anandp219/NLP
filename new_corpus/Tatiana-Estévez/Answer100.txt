These will be the very same people who last week were coughing and imposing their mucus on you. Once 2 or 3 people have said this  you can go to your line manager and explain that as much as you want to finish those spreadsheets  youre annoying a lot of people by your very presence and maybe you should just stay home for a few days.Please believe me when I say that these are just the highlights of our etiquette system. The thing that makes us special is not the amount of rules  I'm sure this is the same in most countries  but you'll pretty much never know or be told if you get these rules wrong.
