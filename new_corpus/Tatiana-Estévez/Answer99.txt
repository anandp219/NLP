The exception here is if youre hungover from the Thursday drinks and/or just fancy a long weekend. Then it clearly makes sense for you to take the time off.Being actually sick with coughing and mucus should be something you should get to stay home with  but no  first you must come into the office so that you can be sure that everyone knows youre coughing and there is mucus involved. A couple of days of this should ensure you have people complaining that you should go home and not spread your germs.
