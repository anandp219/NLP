I was working for one company when we merged with another. I was really shocked by their extremely long-winded way of representing data they produced for infographics  it was a combination of copying and pasting screen shots and retyping data. Although they created beautiful outputs  the error rate was appalling. My boss said not to worry about them and to not mention my ideas  just do it their way. I was genuinely shocked that she was encouraging this extremely inefficient and costly method because she just didn't want to have an awkward conversation.
