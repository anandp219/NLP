(re: "I get offers from guys I once dated and after they married asking that we have an affair"- I'm assuming it's statistically implausible for all of them to be engaged in mutual open marriages)No offense- it sounds like you're following some kind of superficial script. This dating script seems to never deviate from: meet guy->have meals and conversations in expensive places->have sex after a specified number of dates->guy leaves- in your words. The truth seems to be that these men do not respect you  do not respect their wives  and do not respect themselves- otherwise they would not only call you up for sex when they feel like it.
