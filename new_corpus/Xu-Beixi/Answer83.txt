The other question is  why do you give your brain space to said men of poor moral character? I hope to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you shut them down immediately  never to speak to them ever again.The other half of the equation is: are these men you're meeting even worth marrying? Why do you wish to marry? Do you want to be in the position of all those aforementioned wives whose husbands are propositioning other women? Or is marriage the goal for you- and the man in question is merely a placeholder?
