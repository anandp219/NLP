  Studies have answered your question. Women do have fantasies of violence  including rape fantasies  and often suspect other women do (up to 30%)  but they do not ever wish to really be treated violently. Love By Numbers and Decoding Love has more on that. Pubmed has a recent study here (albeit only of female undergraduates in a particular university):Results indicated that 62% of women have had a rape fantasy  which is somewhat higher than previous estimates. For women who have had rape fantasies  the median frequency of these fantasies was about 4 times per year  with 14% of participants reporting that they had rape fantasies at least once a week.
