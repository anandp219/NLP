  It sounds like you're two ships passing in the night  almost living separate lives at this point.I don't think it's selfish or controlling to kindly ask your partner to spend time with you. Neither does it make sense to declare oneself as such ("I'm not controlling")- this is not up to you to decide. Also  one thing that stood is: "my fiancee said that she doesn't want me to be caged"- it honestly comes off as an euphemism  since you're precisely asking her to make plans. It sounds more like "I don't want me to be caged"- which is why I hope you clarify with her directly.
