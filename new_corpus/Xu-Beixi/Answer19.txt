Be sure to take the time to really listen to what your spouse is saying. Give each other uninterrupted time to share your view on things.Be direct but gentle. Neither of you has anything to gain by holding back your true feelings. Remember: unresolved issues lie at the heart of emotional detachment. So lay all your cards out on the table by sharing your hurts clearly. Dont allow things to get out of hand. Be committed to talk through things sensibly. Take breaks to cool it if necessary but agree to continue.
