A few others to come to mind would be Mel Gibson  Ariana Grande  Katherine Heigl  Megan Fox (not so much jerkiness  but calling Michael Bay Hitler). Yet others get off scot-free: Woody Allen  Alfred Hitchcock  Christian Bale (not a continuous jerk  but he had a famous outburst on the set of Terminator)  J Lo  Julia Roberts (if anyone remembers her A Low  Vera shirt)  Claire Danes  Demi Lovato (punching out her dancer)  Naomi Campbell  Terry Richardson  Alec Baldwin  Sean Penn  Halle Berry  Russell Crowe  Russell Brand  the Real Housewives of Wherever  reality stars in general  and many  many more.
