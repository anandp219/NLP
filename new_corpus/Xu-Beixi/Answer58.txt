The time to do right by yourself and others is always now. If I were you  I'd make it clear. At its worst  the relationship takes on a new dimension that's slightly awkward. At best  you eventually work your way towards each other and start a new life. After all  you both appear to be mobile to some degree  and there is no telling if those moves reverse in the future. It seems to me there is little to lose  but the world to gain should you tell him how you truly feel.Thanks for the A2A  and I wish you all the very best.
