Make your spouse and sorting things out your new priority.Deal with your own stuff. If I am feeling abandoned by my spouse  I need to ask myself a tough question: What have I done to drive my spouse away? Now it may not be only your responsibility. Nevertheless  you have to find out what you are responsible for and take ownership for your actions. Really listen to your spouse. Of course  there are things that your mate needs to deal with  and they may be withdrawing from you for selfish reasons  but that cant stop you from taking the steps that you know you need to take.
