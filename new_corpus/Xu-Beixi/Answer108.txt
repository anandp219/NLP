  No.The rule is clear: those able-bodied should offer a seat to those who are less so. In all the major Asian cities I've been to (and this happens in many other places  I imagine)  train seats closest to the doors are marked out as 'priority seats'  with clear indication that this was meant for pregnant women  the elderly  those with small children  the handicapped  and those otherwise in ill health.This works both ways  I've had a seat given up to me by a gentleman when I felt faint one morning on the way to work  and have conversely given them up.
