  As a newly-arrived immigrant without a higher education and with limited skill in the language of your new home  your job prospects are pretty limited. You can choose manual labor. In a lot of cases there's a business sector that is dominated by people from your country and is set up to hire newly-arrived immigrants (think Cambodian donut shops or Vietnamese hairdressers in the USA). But the one skill you probably have is feeding yourself and your family  so opening a restaurant to make a living from that skill makes a lot of sense.
