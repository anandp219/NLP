  Dalian is my favorite city in China  though more because it has a laid-back vibe and a relatively clean environment than because it's chock full of attractions. Nonetheless  here are some things I've enjoyed in my time there:Tiger Beach () has a small aquarium with penguins and other animals  an amusement park  and an old Chinese Navy ship you can board and walk around.Russian Street east of the train station is a remnant of the city's past  when it was called Dairen and was part of Russia. You can see the old Russian-style buildings and browse shops full of Russian goods  from food to random knickknacks.The Shell Museum near Xinghai Park has an impressive collection of seashells with information (in Chinese) on the animals that used to wear them.
