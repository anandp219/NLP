If you're a Chinese person who is concerned about English-speaking foreigners butchering your name  in a lot of cases you're free to romanize it in whatever way you like and you can just put the Yale romanization on your business card. (Of course  French- or Spanish-speaking foreigners will proceed to read it using their own languages' pronunciation rules and you'll be back to square one. )But it's the prerogative of China to decide on the official romanization system for its national language  and they chose pinyin.
