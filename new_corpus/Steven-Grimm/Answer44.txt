  "Best" is pretty general and I don't think any one place deserves that label without qualification. But here are my picks in a few categories:Best natural scenery: Jiuzhaigou. This place is just as stunning as it looks in all the pictures. In autumn the red and yellow leaves on the trees are a delightful contrast to the deep blues and greens of the minerals in the water. I intend to go back in wintertime at some point to see what it's like in the ice and snow.Best food: Chengdu. The food is pretty good in a lot of places in China.
