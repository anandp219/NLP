Before you look at that inner loop  ask yourself if all the work the code is doing is even required by the user. For example  maybe you only need to search 10% of the items with an estimate of how many additional search results there are. Boom  massive speedup. This kind of falls under the principle  "The fastest code is the code that never needs to run at all. "After that  see if the approach you're taking is the best one. For example  maybe you're using an O(n) algorithm where an O(n log n) one would also work.
