)So your goal as a beginning programmer is not to carefully choose the one and only one language you will be stuck using for the rest of your career. Rather  it's to establish the fundamentals you'll use to pick up whatever language is appropriate for the task at hand.What you should concern yourself with as a beginner is the concepts and the mindset that you'll need no matter what language you're using  and pretty much any major language will get you there. So you should shoot for whichever language you find most pleasant and find yourself picking up most readily.
