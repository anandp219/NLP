The best individual restaurants in the country are probably in Beijing and Shanghai. But in Chengdu  unlike those cities  there seems to be very little bad food; everything I had from every mom-and-pop eatery and street vendor and fancy restaurant while I was there was delicious.Best tourism: Beijing. Hard to top the depth and breadth of Chinese history on display in and around this city; the Forbidden City alone takes more than a full day if you really want to see everything. The tourist infrastructure is well-developed and the city has plenty to offer people with all kinds of different interests.
