But it's not too hard to imagine sexually-reproducing aliens that have the same kinds of variance in individual taste that humans do  which would mean a greater-than-zero chance of mutual attraction with a human.Mutual attraction gets more likely the more physically similar the aliens are to humans  and gets a huge boost if there's some means by which actual reproduction is possible (it's no wonder there are so many half-humans running around in the "Star Trek" universe!) but I don't think even extreme physical differences would cause the probability to drop to zero.
