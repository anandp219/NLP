Broadly  it's still similar to English: a rise in tone at the end turns a sentence into a question. But the syllables at the end of the sentence still need to have their own tones. So what you end up doing is starting from a baseline of a steadily rising intonation and making tone changes relative to that  such that a word that would normally be pronounced with a flat intonation is instead pronounced with a rising one  a word that would normally be pronounced with a rising tone gets a tone that rises much faster than usual  and a word that would normally be pronounced with a falling tone either becomes flat or falls only slightly.
