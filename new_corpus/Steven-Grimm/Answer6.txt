But such cases  at least in my feed  seem to be a vanishingly tiny minority of the content that's posted anonymously.Empirically  based on some passes I've done through my feed at various times  I find that over half of the content in my Quora feed that I'd consider noise rather than signal is from anonymous questions. And only about 15-20% of the content I consider worthwhile is from anonymous questions. This is a big enough drag on my feed quality that I actually wrote a browser extension to auto-hide anonymous questions from my feed.
