Those games are heavily story-driven and emotionally engaging. The only concern I'd have is that if he thinks games are childish  stories about zombies and werewolves might not do a lot to change his mind. To the Moon might be a better choice in that case.Another option is something abstract like Osmos  with no story and no characters  just simple shapes.In general I'd look to the casual game space rather than the kinds of games hardcore gamers usually play; casual games are designed from the ground up to be highly accessible and generally make far fewer assumptions about one's existing experience or skill.
