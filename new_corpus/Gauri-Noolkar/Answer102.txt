The average pay isn't extraordinary  but with the right opportunities  you can definitely do well financially.This field is largely dominated by NGOs  but many MNCs are also involved through their CSR programmes. You could also work with governments and international organisations like the World Bank and the UN. If you are someone who is sensitive about human welfare and development  this is your chance to do something about it. It is a field which is not much sought after - an average Economics graduate would want to be a banker more than an agricultural economist with an NGO for instance - and a conscious decision to step into this field would mean you choose to positively impact the lives of the masses every single day.
