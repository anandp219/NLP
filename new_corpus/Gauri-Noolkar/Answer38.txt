  By ignoring him.The more you hit back  criticize  condemn and attack the fellow  the more views he will get  and the more popular his shows will be. Everyone loves to see a tamasha  and that's what he delivers with style and a dash of some overt 'patriotism' (his nation wants to know...). He is entertainment and some excitement for our largely dull  cardboard cut-out lives  and that's what he feeds on.Separate news from entertainment while aiming for healthy doses of both. Get an interesting life  so that Arnab's drama doesn't become your staple.And stop watching the show.If enough people do it  he will either change or fade away...
