  Ideally  any country that is approached by refugees should try its level best to take them in. I do not know if Syrian refugees are approaching China (please let me know if and how you have come across any such information). I have doubts though  whether China would be a good place for refugee rehabilitation. The country is already over-populated  its resources are stressed beyond measure - I read somewhere that 80% of its cities are already water stressed  and it is already suffering from unrest  especially in its western Xinjiang province.
