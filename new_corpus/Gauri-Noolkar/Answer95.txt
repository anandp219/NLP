Roads turned into one-ways are often those on which are heavily packed with traffic. Too many traffic signals on one main road are frustrating - you stop at one  you stop at all. U-turns not allowed  meaning you have to go four blocks further just to go one block back from your original position. A street full of shops and restaurant has no parking space  meaning you have to park by the road side  and make the road more congested  or park at some faraway spot and walk down all the way. Driving in one lane consistently isn't easy  because you never know when you will come across a pothole or a dog or a hawker  and you will have to swerve instantly into the lane beside you  disturbing all the vehicles in your vicinity.And added to it  the lack of patience or time  because we have exhausted it all in fixing other things of our daily life.This leads us to finding our own solutions - even if they be illegal or downright wrong or harmful.
