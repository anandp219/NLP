My mother-in-law floundered with margins in MS-Word and macros in MS-Excel  but her research and analysis were flawless.2. You need to have focus. And not the "one lecture and I am done!" focus  but the "I will stay focused as long as it takes" focus. She had that. With the million responsibilities and milestones middle-age brings  she never lost sight of that PhD.3. Yet  you need to be flexible with priorities. No  she did not lock herself in a room all five years  but she shut off everything else (including the kitchen) when she studied and worked on her PhD.
