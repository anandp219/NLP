It can only be relished and lived and relived. And what better occasion than a wedding to do that?So yes  that's it - we got married at a place which gave us a beautiful blend of our five coveted aspects - roots  nature  people  simplicity  and food. We could have hunted and found more similar places  but this one just appealed to us instantly. When it comes to matters of the heart  we felt  the heart is the best judge  after all.I am sure you know a place which preserves your roots in its memory.
