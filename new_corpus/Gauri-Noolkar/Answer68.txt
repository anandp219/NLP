Yet  she persevered and put in 100% in each and every task related to her PhD (down to the last full stop) right till the end. She stayed faithful to her subject  her work  and her deadlines. She really felt for the topic/issue she had chosen and genuinely wanted to address it. It was not a degree  it was her mission. Her conscience was motivated. If this would not be the case  I am fairly certain all the pressures would have gotten the better of her......As I take baby steps towards my PhD  I realise I am no genius either.
