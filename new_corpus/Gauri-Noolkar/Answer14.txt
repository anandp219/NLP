I am aware that it is a symbol of prosperity to 'show' how much you can spend on your saree or the jewellery or the food  but frankly  we don't care much about it. The important part is to get good returns for every penny spent.5. Go back to food - your food.Being the foodies we are  the most important part of the wedding (any wedding) for us is food. It was extremely important to us to have purely Marathi food  cooked by Marathis  served the Marathi way. We were tired of the paneer makhanwalas and biryanis served at Marathi weddings  and even though we love Punjabi food (and Punjabis)  we are just... not Punjabis.We Indians are fortunate to inherit such a stunning culinary culture  and while pizzas and pastas are always welcome  exploring one's local and historical food is an experience indescribable in words.
