  I am very  very fortunate to be surrounded by people whom I can describe as exceptionally intelligent. They enrich my life greatly  and have made me a permanent admirer and seeker of intelligence. I have also been fortunate enough to see their lives closely  as they have opened up to me  directly or indirectly  and given me important glimpses of their lives.The best part about being intelligent is that it enriches lives  their own as well as those who are close to them. Of course  if it is harnessed in the most optimum and wise manner  which these people have.
