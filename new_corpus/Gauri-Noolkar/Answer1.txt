  I do not know how cold it gets in Ahmedabad  but yes  Pune has what we call "  "  translated literally as a "rosy winter"  which does make you reach out for your shawls and sweaters for a few weeks in the year.Winters in Pune have always been lovely  partly because they are extremely pleasant and partly because the city looks lovely just after the monsoon has rolled out its greenery before its departure. The mornings are misty  and in some parts  you can actually see your breath if you go for an early morning stroll or a jog.
