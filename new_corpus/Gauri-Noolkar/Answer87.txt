  Not exactly ancient history  but one decent movie about a period in India before the British is Jodhaa Akbar by Ashutosh Gowarikar.It is an out-and-out commercial movie  but manages to retain decency and sense  without any of the loudness and flamboyance most of the commercial blockbuster hits rely on. I do not know how historically accurate the story is  but it is acceptable  and quite engaging.The sets and actors brim and overflow with beauty  and the music is simply superb. Ashutosh Gowarikar manages to tone down Hrithik Roshan's hyper acting to the level that his face now permanently represents a young Akbar to everyone who has watched this film - just as Prithviraj Kapoor personifies an old Akbar for everyone who has watched Mughal-e-Azam.
