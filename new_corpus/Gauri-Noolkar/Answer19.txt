Then there are those who firmly believe in the economic lens - that the burden of refugees on their economy will do them no good  and it should not be theirs to bear. The religious angle is sceptical of the change migrants will bring  and anti-Islamists will stress on the possible spread of Islamic fundamentalism.All of these make sense when views them through just that one angle  but bring all aspects into picture and its a mess - and no one answer. European countries have their own problems which are not conducive to acceptance of refugees  yet they cannot just shut their doors on the face of fellow human beings.
