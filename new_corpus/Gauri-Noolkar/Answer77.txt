Indians who travel abroad or come in contact with non-Indians come across as a curious lot  keen to explore or at least be informed about other parts of the world  while the lesser privileged back home make the point clear by bestowing unabashed stares on anyone or anything looking 'unIndian'  whether in reel or real life. Be it plain curiosity or a hidden agenda  Indians never cease wondering about how things are across the planet. Many non-Indians I know  especially Americans  marvel at the curiosity and the enthusiasm through which Indians look at the world.
