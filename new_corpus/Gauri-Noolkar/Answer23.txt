  The problem with "ghar wapsi" is that it is a misfit in the current social mood  orientation and outlook of India. The 'modern' section of the Indian society is increasingly disillusioned with a distorted concept of secularism  often confusing it with bashing/lack of respect for Hinduism with an irrationally soft corner for religions which actually force/induce conversions. This section  though a minority  is also the one which is the most educated  and wielding power over most resources within the country  ensuring that their voices prevail over all.
