  I missed the two meetups that happened here in Pune  so technically  I am not qualified to answer this question. However  I was on the Whatsapp group of Pune Quorans for a while  so I could try answering anyway.Losing taste for Quora after meeting a bunch of Quorans is like turning atheist after meeting some ardent devotees of God. While it is a natural reaction  I don't find it thoughtful enough. Sure  Quorans can be annoying and snobbish and incessantly intellectual  but so can anyone and everyone off Quora.
