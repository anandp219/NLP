Hell  the combined cost of all our wedding costumes would barely buy a saree in a mainstream Indian wedding (yes  I am actually happy that my wedding saree is not at all expensive). We spent instead on the comfort of our friends and family  on food  and on helping the local economy - and we did not spend much.The wedding was no grand affair  but it was comfortable and fun  and a big reason for that was the venue. It was so inexpensive! Wedding facilities in city charge us wayyyy higher than necessary  and most facilities are grossly overpriced.
