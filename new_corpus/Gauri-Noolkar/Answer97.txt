  "at least on Independence Day"? I wonder what that is supposed to mean. Do you mean to imply that we should put up a mask to "save face" on a day that is a landmark in our history?Our advertisements do not showcase dark-skinned Indians because  face it  that's not what we want to see. We - yes  all of us - are so programmed to expect performers and models  especially those on TV  to be 'good looking'  that anyone who does not fit that criteria is instantly viewed with a raised eyebrow.Yes  there are caveats.It is true that Indians  largely  the young generation  has begun to slowly overcome the "white is beautiful" mindset.
