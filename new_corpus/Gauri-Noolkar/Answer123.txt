  Most of my generation first heard of Canada due to Celine Dion  the singer of "My Heart Will Go On". We thought she was American  but hey  she turned out to be from - what? Kanedda. In India  Canada (or to be precise  Kanedda) is that lesser-known  less controversial  colder cousin of the USA (or to be precise  Amayreeka) heavily preferred by Indian (read Punjabi) population to migrate to. And oh  the word Kanedda is to be always  always said with a follow up of Punjabi sounding drum beats in the mind...sort of the dhink chik taak chik  dhink chik taak chik kind.Canada for Indians is the good  quiet cousin of USA which seldom appears in the news.
