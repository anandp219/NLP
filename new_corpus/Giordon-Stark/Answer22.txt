This meant  in large part  the data format was decided ahead of time and "frozen" in place  so even if changes were going to be made  it would only happen after commissioning and Phase 0 upgrades[2]. This kind of output data from the detector is not readable in ROOT  so people spent a large amount of time translating the data into something that was ROOT-readable.which is now superseded with the new Analysis model that allows for re-derived  re-skimmed  re-slimmed  re-thinned  re-reduced datasets in nearly real-time -- even as the datasets are on the order of petabytes and terabytes!And there is an AOD2AOD in the bottom left of the figure which means that datasets we've reconstructed from the top-level tier can be re-run with the update calibrations  systematics  and improved reconstruction techniques on a periodic basis during the operator of the LHC detector.So what kind of data is actually involved/stored in the first place?which is a significant amount.
