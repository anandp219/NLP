You can apply this by defining your two point charges separated by a distance [math]d[/math] for a physical dipole (a pure dipole is one where [math]d\to 0[/math]) but we can approximate a physical dipole correctly as long as we measure the electric field at a point [math]r \gg d[/math]. All that is left is to define our boundary conditions and we can pretty much guarantee that a solution that solves this equation and satisfies the boundary condition must be the solution.
