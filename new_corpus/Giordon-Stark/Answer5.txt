It's easier to understand broken english in text than broken english in speech.Email = NewsfeedEver since I used email  I treated it like text messages  like tasks  like to do lists  like a calendar  like reminders  pretty much controlling everything I do. I'm a pretty busy guy. I like to think I'm smart. It's very hard for me to remember anything and everything I do and/or need to do. To this extent  I used Outlook from the beginning  then switched to Thunderbird because of concise tagging  quick searching  and email grouping into bundles of items.
