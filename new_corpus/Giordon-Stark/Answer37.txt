It has no idea what the actual data is because everything is retrieved via pointers. Because of this  we can slowly unfold and expand the data at various locations that we care about... and we know where to unpack the data because we know where everything is! We just don't know what it is. So let's see what the value is for some events  such as the ZCUT12 branch we've found.12345678root [13] mytree->GetEntry(0)(Int_t)720490root [15] mytree->GetBranch("jet_AntiKt10TruthTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR30_ZCUT12")(class TBranch*)0x26eb520root [18] mytree->GetBranch("jet_AntiKt10TruthTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR30_ZCUT12")->GetEntry(0)(Int_t)10root [19] mytree->GetBranch("jet_AntiKt10LCTopo_pt")->GetEntry(0)(int_t) 12and so on.
