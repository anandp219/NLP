Then  there's an interface on top of the StoreGate which is smaller and understands where to find the data because it pre-computes pointers to objects stored in the StoreGate to retrieve them  rather than storing the actual value itself.Because of the added complexity  you will need specific C++ classes developed for this specific access if you want to take advantage of the newly-implemented object-oriented approach to accessing data in a much faster way.
