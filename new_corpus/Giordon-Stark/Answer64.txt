  Here are a few (as a Physicist  I'm somewhat biased)We can go faster than light. We can't go faster than the speed of light. One is a constant that Einstein gave us in Special Relativity and Maxwell with his equations.The Sun  our star  is actually white with peak output around the green wavelengths. Our atmosphere scatters light at lower wavelengths (eg: blue) which is why the sky is blue and the Sun appears yellow/orange.Don't believe atoms  they make up everything. (Technically  this is a thing Feynman said  somewhat paraphrased).The strong force is magical.
