  Warning: severe usage of acronyms.This is a tricky question. There is so much history and experience (> 20 years  countless million hours of man power) behind data storage. First  when it comes to grid computing at CERN and LHC  all resources are collected into a unifying location[1].Next  there are a lot of experiments at CERN:ATLAS (I work with this)ALICECMSLHCband each experiment does something different. Because of the large amount of information and not trying to explain them all  I'll only talk about ATLAS (A Large Toroidal LHC Apparatus).In Run 1  from 2008-2013 - ATLAS had a computing model that was at the top level Tier  frozen.
