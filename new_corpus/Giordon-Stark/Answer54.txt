When it changes direction and goes back towards [math]\phi = 0[/math] from [math]\phi^-[/math]  the magnetic force is in the [math]-\hat{z}[/math] direction so the dipole is being pulled down. Therefore  it will oscillate up and down through the [math]xy[/math]-plane while it spins in the [math]xy[/math]-plane quite symmetrically. When it spins counter-clockwise  it goes up. When it spins clockwise  it goes down.If the magnetic field is in the [math]\hat{y}[/math] direction  as the force via torque on the charges due to electric field decrease  the force on the magnetic field decreases in the [math]-\hat{z}[/math] direction (right-hand rule).
