Optical-fibre links working at 10 gigabits per second connect CERN to each of the 13 major Tier 1 centres around the world. This dedicated high-bandwidth network is called the LHC Optical Private Network (LHCOPN).Why is the data size so big?When the LHC is operational for Run 2  from early 2015 through to 2018  it will be processing events at a rate of 40 MHz (Megahertz). In other words  40 million events per second. This is a staggering 25 nanoseconds between collisions at an unprecedented energy level.
