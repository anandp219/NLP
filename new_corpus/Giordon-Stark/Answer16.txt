Who wrote the section on the TWiki about that?5) general restyling of OverlapRemover. Implemented a template function in HelperFunctions to fill the output ConstDV (can be reused w/ slight changes by any EL algo)Does the template just basically deal with making subsets for a given flag? What's the point of "tool_name" here? If you don't mind  I might try cleaning up the template a bit (eg: I'm not sure we need all the declarations below  since the compiler should fill it in for us based on what the code uses and we could potentially combine it into one type)In the OR tool  the logic of the Overlaps flag is reverted.
