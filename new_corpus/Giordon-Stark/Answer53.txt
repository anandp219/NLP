Let's look at maxima and minimum. The torque is a maximum at 90 degrees  and zero at 0 degrees.If the magnetic field is aligned with the electric field (both in the [math]\hat{x}[/math] direction)  as the force via torque on the charges due to electric field decreases  the force on the magnetic field increases in the [math]+\hat{z}[/math] direction (right-hand rule) on both charges. As the dipole swings past through [math]\phi = 0[/math]  the force on the magnetic field is a maximum and then starts decreasing  but still points in the [math]+\hat{z}[/math] direction.
