HTML and regex go together like love  marriage  and ritual infanticide. The <center> cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty. If you parse HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous ways which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name cannot be expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane  he comes. HTML-plus-regexp will liquify the nerves of the sentient whilst you observe  your psyche withering in the onslaught of horror.
