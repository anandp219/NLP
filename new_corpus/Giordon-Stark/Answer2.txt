  CERN has released an Open Data initiative with some data sets: CERN Open Data PortalNote that due to the incredibly large size  CSV format is highly inefficient. They use ROOT formats  which you would need to learn how to use. There are plenty of tools for this.In particular  the large amount of data necessitates a smarter organization. Now  the ROOT files have what is called a StoreGate where the raw data is stored in a structure of arrays sorted by type. This means that all raw data treated as ints are stored in one array while raw data treated as floats are stored in another.
