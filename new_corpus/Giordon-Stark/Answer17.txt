Basically an object flagged as "overlaps" should not be pushed back to the output ConstDataVector  whereas an object flagged as "passSel" should. Since the aim of the template function is to be usable by any selector  I opted for having an exceptionfor the OR case  at least until Steven does not revert the logic of the "Overlaps" flag.6) added enum in HelperClasses to classify "containerType". This replaces "ints" for m_type. See OverlapRemover for a working example.Everything compiles in Base 2.0.25.However  I get a crash at runtime b/c some passSel flags are still ints and not chars.
