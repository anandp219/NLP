To put this in perspective  [math]\int_0^1 \sin(2\pi x) \text{d}x = 0[/math]does not imply that [math]\sin(2\pi x)[/math] is zero everywhere on the interval.However  as Brian correctly pointed out  you need to really apply some sort of symmetry to make that surface integral evaluate nicely for you to figure out  at least  the magnitude of the electric field.Instead  you deal with Poisson's equation [math]\nabla^2 \phi = \rho[/math] which gives you the flexibility of not requiring symmetry to easily solve it (although it does help).
