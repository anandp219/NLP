Here are the major changes:1) fixed ConstDataVector  const xAODContainer issues in all Muon* and Electron* modules2) changed all passSel flags from int to char in all Muon* and Electron* modulesAwesome  thanks.3) in JetCalibrator  added possibility to extract flag "simulationFlavour" to use correct calibration for MC (NB: need to define flag for each sample in your job steering macro)Can you elaborate on this? Shouldn't this already exist in the MetaData tree? You do something similar to extra other information in BasicEventSelection (which might need to be renamed).This apparently is the only way to do the job outside of Athena  unfortunately.
