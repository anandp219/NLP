  Rather than trying to determine if you are getting the same dollar-for-dollar benefits as your coworkers  try thinking about this question from an employer's point of view. You will almost always lose when you play the tit-for-tat game. Someone is going to take more sick days than you  someone is going to use more dental or health insurance benefits  someone is going to consume more of those sugar packets offered near the coffee machine  or eat more shrimp at the employee retreat. If you shift your view and consider how you might lure in and keep employees if it were your company  your perspective might change a bit.
