I know that it probably seems like new friendships are challenging only for us "chosen few" who were truly blessed with an introverted nature -- reserved and shy or serious at times -- but that really isn't the case. It's fairly universally tough and intimidating to put yourself out there - feeling exposed and vulnerable. The "putting yourself out there" part is similar in many ways to dating. There is nothing wrong with you  lovely girl  making new friends just isn't a cake walk.The good news  and there is good news  is that there are a lot of ways to branch out and meet new friends and new people!
