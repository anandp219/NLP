And don't forget that the terrain is very hilly in places. Don't be surprised if you feel a little car sick winding around the steep roads. Cycling is probably not the ideal main mode of transport choice for the casual tourist  but definitely a fun thing to do for entertainment if you have the time one afternoon.If everyone in your group would like to have a drink or four you might consider a tour. If your group is considering joining a larger tour keep in mind that not all wineries warmly welcome tour buses and their groups.
