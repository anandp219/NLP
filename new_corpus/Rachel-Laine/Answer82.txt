  Dating is notoriously unfun for a reason. A person who isn't dating might look at themselves in the mirror and think  "I could probably stand to see the inside of a gym more often  but I'm not doing too badly overall." A person who is actively seeking love might glance into the mirror and never climb out because they are too busy picking out so-called flaws. That invisible wrinkle on their brow  pores that are too large  a hair or three that need to be waxed  not enough fat here or too much fat there  not enough muscle here or too much muscle there  not enough hair up top or too much hair down there -- the list is as endless as a hall of mirrors.
