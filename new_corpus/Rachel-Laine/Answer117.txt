If I had been born with beautiful teeth (okay  or even just decent teeth) I wouldn't have gotten to miss school for all of those orthodontist appointments which was a ritual that I secretly loved. My mother would take me out for a strawberry milkshake after my appointments at a little cafe  which was a rare treat and more time out of school. I have never met anyone who dislikes having straight teeth or complains that they wish they didn't have straight teeth. Even in spite of the spontaneously snapping rubber bands  awkward kisses  slobbery  lost retainers  and bad pictures  straight teeth always win.
