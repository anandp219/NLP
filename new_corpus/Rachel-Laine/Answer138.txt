I felt lonely. Existentially lonely. I didn't feel wise or mature or like I understood anything. I felt like everyone was playing a game of musical chairs and I was the one who was always left without a chair. The one who didn't belong. As I have traveled through life I have been accused of being an old soul several more times (by people other than a mother desperate to soothe her daughter's tears). I still have trouble - more than 25 years later - reconciling the feeling of existential loneliness with this positive construct of being an "old soul".
