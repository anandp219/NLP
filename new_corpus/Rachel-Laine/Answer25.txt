Look  honey  all these charity event invitations! !Nope  not the gala kind where you get to wear your LBD and heels kind. When you are married to a Silicon Valley programmer  events like your second cousin's wedding in the Midwest can become uncomfortable charity events. It all begins when your grandma or whomever starts bragging to the table that J is like the best computer person  like  ever. I mean like rockets and spaceships and stuff (sorry  J  I think what you do is very interesting  but it's not rockets and spaceships).
