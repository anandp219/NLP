  Colleges and universities have a vested interest in enrolling students who are able to thrive and succeed in the school's academic environment. It does a disservice to both the student and the institution to knowingly accept a student who will struggle and likely fail and  moreover  not go on to represent the institution well as an alumni. It's a lose - lose. If psychological testing proves to be an effective adjunct tool for assessing which prospective students will thrive and which will fail then this is a positive thing.
