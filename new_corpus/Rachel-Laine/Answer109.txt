This is when my mind wanders to those fantastic places where creativity is alive and boundless. Those places that make my husband tremble in fear when I come home and say  "guess what I'm gonna do  honey  isn't this a GREAT IDEA?!!" While I will (probably) never set out to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro  I do pay careful attention to how I'm spending my energy when I want to create. I'm an introvert  but I unfortunately spend a lot of time in denial about my introverted nature. Much like a woman of 50 who dresses like she's 20.
