Rather than trying to convince such a heterogeneous audience that driving is patently unnecessary  have you tried asking other probing questions so that you might better understand the motivations? Like why people might choose to live in the suburbs and spend a long time commuting rather than living in the city where they work? Or why people might choose not to carpool? Why a family might need two cars? What has stopped public transportation from being better/more efficient? Can you take a stroller on a public bus?
