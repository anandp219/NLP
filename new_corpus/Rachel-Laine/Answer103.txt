While I did have a car  I chose not to drive into work on a daily basis as it was much easier and more economical to take public transportation. I could have gotten by without a car entirely  but I am glad that I chose to have a car as it allowed me to easily take weekend trips to Napa or to the coast. A car also made little errands like getting groceries easier and more convenient. It was indeed a luxury to have a car and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I think it's a bit problematic to make a sweeping statement like "driving is unnecessary" when your audience includes very remote places with no public transportation at all and large urban centers with arguably advanced public transportation networks and more and more alternative choices like Uber and Lyft.
