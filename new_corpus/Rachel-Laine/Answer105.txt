  I have always been jealous of creative types. Jealous in the wonder and awe way and jealous in the way that stings a little. Creative people are just so damn cool. They somehow pull off with great je ne sais quoi this unnatural combination of being totally carefree but also very hardworking  and incredibly passionate yet very down-to-earth and centered. A very cool bunch. I am not one of these people. I am sort of the opposite of one of these people. I recently received a wedding invite that instructed me to RSVP with a Haiku.
