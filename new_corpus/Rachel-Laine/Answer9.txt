  Ah  gossip. We love to hate it...or is it just love? A 2011 NY Times article  "The Gossip Machine  Churning Out Cash " estimates that the celeb gossip industry tops out at more than 3 billion revenue each year. Pretty shocking  right? Or is it not surprising at all? People are voyeurs. People are bored  jealous  insecure  seeking approval. People are all kinds of things. So why am I talking about celebrity gossip when you are asking about your personal life? To illustrate how insidious and deeply entrenched gossip has become in our society.
