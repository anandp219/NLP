Keep in mind that it's very rare that two people will have the same exact idea of what is "good" and what is "bad". This means that you might think her lasagna tastes like it came from an elementary school cafeteria  but it might be her childhood favorite. Likewise  she might think that gravy you like tastes like paste  but she makes it because you like it. This is one of those great relationship compromises.
