  It's fun to hop in the DeLorean once in a while and cruise around in time. Two hundred years is quite a drive even for the DeLorean. I imagine that someone traveling back 200 years in time wouldn't be in a sleek DeLorean  for starters  and would observe the following as woefully unbearable or note these things:The way that we diagnose and treat mental health conditions and disorders like depression and bipolar disorder.The death penalty.Women's beauty routines. Hot wax where? Foils on her head?
