That pretty dress  those heels  her hair styled just so? This all takes time  money  and effort. When I was younger my friends and I would help each other get ready for dates. We weren't saying to one another  "This is the date that you said yes to for the food  right? Are you going to order the lobster?" We were asking about her feelings for the guy. What he was like. How the date had been set up. How she had been feeling since her date with Mr. Chews With Open Mouth. Even though you are only saying "yes" to sharing a few hours together  the emotional investment and potential messiness are worth a whole lot more than her 12 dollar tilapia entree.
