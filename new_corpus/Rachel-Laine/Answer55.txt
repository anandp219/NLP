In the give and take of a relationship  occasionally an apology will be just about the other person's needs and that's okay. Apologies help people to save face and that's important. When we love and respect people  helping them to save face and saving face ourselves is part of the relationship tango. This is part of the idea behind an "act of contrition". Being contrite isn't necessarily *always* about being woefully and excessively ashamed of what you have said or done  but about understanding and caring for your partner's needs and the needs of the relationship.
