  No  you are most certainly not a "bad girl" (I shudder just typing that phrase) or anything of the sort. I grew up in a Christian home  too. Your 20's are a really great time when you get to start making choices and learning about what is right for you  and it doesn't mean that you are any less Christian if you choose to have sex. This probably seems stunningly obvious  but as you are deciding what is right for you  sexually  make sure that you stay true to what feels right both emotionally and physically.
