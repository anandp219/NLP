Your dad probably wants this for you - he wants the whole BIG world for you.Start by doing your homework. Interview makeup artists. Talk to them about how they got started  where they went to school  how long it took them to get their ideal job. Talk to them about how much beginning makeup artists make. Talk to them about how hard it is to get a job in your area. Talk to more than one. Talk to as many as you possibly can. If you find out  through your interviews  that a beginning makeup artist makes 15k a year  do the math.
