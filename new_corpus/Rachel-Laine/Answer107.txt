The dishes piling up in the sink. The dinner or lunches that have to be made. The bills that have to be paid. The pets or children that have to be cared for. The mile long to-do list that hasn't been touched. Out of sight  out of mind is pure bliss sometimes. This bedroom/love life theory applies for me when I want to create something. Except that I don't need to check into a hotel somewhere tropical and no sexy lingerie is required. I just need to get out of my regular environment and away from those small  everyday stresses.
