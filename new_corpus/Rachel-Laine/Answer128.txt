Bhavesh is *most definitely* a quality person. Maybe even her exact definition of a quality person.Bhavesh is a rare mix of very hard working and whip smart and playful and funny. He is incredibly witty and while he is most certainly a studious adult  his childlike sense of wonder hasn't become a casualty of his adultness. Bhavesh knows how to weave a compelling story together  so go and read some of his answers  for goodness sake - now!! He really knows his stuff  too! Everything from science and medicine to philanthropy to music to fitness to childhood pleasures.
