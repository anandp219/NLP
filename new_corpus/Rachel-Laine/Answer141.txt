  Absolutely. I definitely qualify as an introvert and I worked in both in-house and agency public relations. As with most jobs  there were parts of my job that I loved and parts of my job that I was less enthusiastic about. I loved writing press releases and drafting pitches and doing research. I was less enthusiastic about making calls to editors or talking to television producers or attending cocktail parties. While I got the job done well  these calls and meetings and parties drained much more of my energy than they did for many of my extroverted coworkers who fed off of these activities like leprechauns on clover.
