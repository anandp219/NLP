  It is great to have a real passion for something. Whether it is a passion for a career or a hobby or a weekend job  many people never find a true passion or something that they just love to do. Something that makes them feel incredible. So consider yourself lucky. I suspect that you and your dad share more common ground here than you might think. Your end goal is to be financially independent and rockin' your own career  yes? You might be surprised to discover that this is your father's hope for you as well.
