You might find that you have a better experience at wineries if you hire a private driver for your group and keep it small. If you are not warmly welcomed you might not be able to taste as many wines and the tasting room attendant might not spend as much time giving your group special attention or even occasionally a discount. Sometimes it's worth it to pay a little bit more for a better experience.The wine train is nice  but not as a mode of transportation. It's the equivalent of taking a dinner cruise on a boat.
