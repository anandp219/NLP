Giving yourself time to get to know the group and group dynamics a bit before you angle to be included gives you time to get to know who you want to know better. Once you meet and get to know a few people whom you would like to know better  think about asking them to coffee before class. Invite them to grab a coffee before your class or something else casual that doesn't interfere or intrude upon their post-class dinner plans. You don't want to inadvertently ask them to choose between their group plans  doing something with you  or inviting you along to the group event.
