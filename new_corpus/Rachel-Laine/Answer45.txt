  Relationships with parents are difficult. Especially when we feel that we have contrasting ideologies  perspectives  or goals. And especially when we are living under the same roof. Most parents will always want to put in their two cents and exert their influence  but it gets easier to deal with this as you gain independence over time. Maybe sometimes in your life you will welcome a little parental "love" and sometimes you will nod along and grin at brunch but later ignore their advice. But  back to your question  what should you do now?
