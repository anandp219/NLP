  Wouldn't it be a different world if today's big behemoth companies that sip on a fuel of bureaucracy and TPS reports were populated only by the academically brightest minds? People are hired for a wide variety of reasons. It's possible that you are right and that your peer wasn't as strong as some other candidates in one area  but he might have been the best match in other areas and they decided that he would improve with experience and on-the-job training. When you are coming out of an academic environment that focuses on a very narrow subject  it's very easy to get caught up in the idea that mastery in this subject is the only thing that employers are looking for.
