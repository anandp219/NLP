  The need for more than a simple polite apology usually arises after an emotionally charged event. While most of us go on autopilot and remember without conscious thought that it's appropriate to apologize after you bump into someone accidentally or spill something  it's really difficult to access that same mental cheat sheet and gain perspective in the hours or days immediately following a highly charged emotional tussle. It is important to be acutely aware that when you are in the thick of it your judgment is clouded by your pride and fear and the sting of things that were said and not said.
