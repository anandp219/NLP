  I wouldn't worry overly much about this or make any changes to the list that you have already submitted and shared with your coworkers. I would move on and consider making a change next time. When I receive requests for general feedback and suggestions I keep a few things in mind: The first thing that I keep in mind is that everything is someone's job. So if I'm suggesting a change to something  it's possible that the someone who is in charge of that something will take offense. Everyone is different  but some people are quite sensitive to calls for change to things that they "own".
