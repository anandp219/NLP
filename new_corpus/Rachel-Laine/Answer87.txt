While there isn't only one right or correct approach  there are some things that you might want to keep in mind as you decide how you want to ingratiate yourself.Beware coming on too strong. Not only will this turn your potential new friends off  but it's not fair to you  either. It's ridiculously easy to get swept up in the glamour and magic of the charismatic popular people who have somewhere to go and somewhere to be  but give yourself time to decide if these are people whom you actually like and have things in common with or not.
