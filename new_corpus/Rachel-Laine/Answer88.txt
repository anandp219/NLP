It's possible that these are people that you don't want to eat dinner with or spend a lot of quality time with and would prefer to maintain a more casual  but friendly  relationship. Give yourself a chance to decide before you jump on the bandwagon. Get to know who you want to know. Let's say  for giggles  that there are 30 students in your class. Even if you like all 30 of them (which is rather unlikely - they probably don't even all like each other)  chances are that you don't want to be best friends or even close friends with all 30 of them.
