Bless the people who do this  but this is not a great job for reserved introverts to sign up for. If you arrive at a party at the time designated on the invitation you are  perhaps unwittingly  signing up for the welcoming committee. When you ring the doorbell at the stroke of 7pm  you are saying to your host that you are "that guy". "That guy" bellows a warm welcome to newcomers and integrates them smoothly into the conversation. He insists that they get a drink. He makes them feel welcome and special.
