I felt indignant. I felt violated. I felt angry. I wanted justice - for everyone to know that those wretched things were not true and part of me wanted everyone to know who was responsible for spreading those terrible untruths. Anger bubbled and festered inside of me and the resentment that I felt stained many months of my life. Ironically  part of the way that I wanted to "fight" the gossip was by spreading even MORE gossip. After all  I didn't really know who started the rumors. A bit of an insanity circle.Flash forward and many years and lots of gossip have passed by between that first gossip emotional wreck/disaster and now.
