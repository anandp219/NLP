I also suspect you are seriously underestimating the number of fossil hominids there are. You also appear to not understand that evolution is not linear  it is bushy. Here is an example of a possible cladogram of humans most recent ancestors: Not exactly linear. And that is not a complete catalog of fossil species and many of these have multiple fossil instances.With that said  many clear trends can be found when looking at our ancestry. For example this image:29+ Evidences for MacroevolutionThis image doesn't represent a linear evolution  but it does show the development of derived human like features from something more basal.But here's something else to think about- where are the fossils that show what a pig evolved from  or a bear  what about a dolphin- an air breathing mammal that lives in the water  how did this evolve over millions of years  one gene mutation at a time  and from what?
