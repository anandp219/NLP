If you're looking for a language to sink your teeth into and start learning  then I've heard Python is good. I'm just not sure how far it will take you professionally. JavaScript is pretty easy to learn  but it is also easy to pick up bad habits.If you're looking to take advantage of current opportunities  then we're back to JavaScript which is really hot right now. So  the end result? It really depends on your goals. If you just want to learn  maybe stick with Python. If you want to do cool stuff  or work on the web  or take advantage of current market trends  then JavaScript may be the way to go.Just don't do PHP.
