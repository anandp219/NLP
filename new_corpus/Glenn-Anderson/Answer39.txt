However  based on the DNA evidence  it looks like this interaction was not necessarily common  or failed to produce viable offspring. This could be due to difficulty in successful fertilization because of genomic divergence  or because the two cultures rarely interacted.As far as being the same species  as others have noted  species are a human construct  and nature doesn't really care about our convenience. Species borders can be fuzzy  and gene flow between populations can still happen sporadically leading to occasional hybridization before divergence makes this impossible.For an example of fuzzy species borders  we can look to Ring Species.
