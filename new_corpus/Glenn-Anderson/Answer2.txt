And fortunately while I was loading some trash one day  I found some books that gave all sorts of good information about the Atari 8 bit computers  which is a computer system I was already familiar with. So that gave me the boost I needed to head back to school.But the question is about bad jobs. In my mind  these are jobs where you are ineffectual  and you cannot grow. I grew a lot in that first job  both physically  and motivationally. As software engineer amongst the many excellent jobs I've been fortunate to have  I've had a handful of jobs that felt stagnating.
