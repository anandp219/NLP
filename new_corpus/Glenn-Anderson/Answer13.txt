A shark (a cartilagenous fish)  a dolphin (a mammal)  and an Ichthyosaur (a marine reptile).The details of these are significantly different  but superficially they have arrived at very similar body plans.I think that there are naturally certain niches that will arise  and that there are certain body plans that will be efficient in these niches  and are likely to be hit on  even in a world where life has developed very differently from our own.
