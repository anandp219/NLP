  Morphologically  H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis are very distinct:This is because neanderthals and modern humans split off from a common ancestor about 500 000 years ago. That gives time for a lot of divergence.Culturally  neanderthals and humans were likely very different. For instance  their hunting styles. Based on common injuries found in neanderthal fossils  they found that these were consistent with close-quarters fighting. There is no evidence that they used projectile weapons like early H. sapiens did.Also  in terms of tools and ornamentation  H. sapiens had a far more advanced culture.That said  once you cover a neanderthal with muscle and skin  they look close enough to a humans  despite possible cognitive differences  that given human sexual proclivities  sexual interactions would not be unexpected.
