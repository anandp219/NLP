I actually do well in open floor plans where I have direct contact with my peers and we can collaborate on things when necessary. One thing an open floor plan has is energy.This company was older. Lots older. I'm pushing fifty  and I was was of the younger folks there. The energy was utterly flat. I worked in a cube  with barely any contact with other members of the team. They also didn't seem to understand web based technologies  and I was unable to have any influence in this. The design was horrible  and I couldn't change it.So when an old boss called me up a few moths later and told me he was going to try to poach me  I nearly dropped to the ground to thank god  and I'm an atheist.That job was so bad  it doesn't make it on to my resume.So  lets contrast it with my first job.
