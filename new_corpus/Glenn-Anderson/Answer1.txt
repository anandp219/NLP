  My very first job out of High School was working on a garbage truck. It wasn't unionized  so the pay really wasn't very good  $125/w. And halfway through the job  one out of the two trucks the company owned broke down  so  the route became twice as long. I was always dirty  and came home smelling horrible.I loved that job. I got a lot of fresh air  I built up a lot of muscle  and I liked the people I worked with. However  I did discover something about myself: I didn't want to be a garbage man my whole life.
