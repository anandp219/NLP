.. and our place always smelt of roses.Those were the best years of my life.But Americas war grew worse and worse and eventually came to London...not for anyone.I remember how the meaning of words began to change;how unfamiliar words likecollateral and rendition became frightening while things like Norsefire andthe Articles of Allegiance became powerful.I remember how different became dangerous.I still dont understand it why they hate us so much.They took Ruth while she was out buying food.It seems strange that my life should end in such a terrible place I shall die here.Every inch of me shall perish.
