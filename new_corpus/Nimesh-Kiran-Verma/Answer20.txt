  Lal BihariThis guy became ghost when he had no official documents to prove that he is alive and hence was considered dead by the Indian state.Lal Bihari from Uttar Pradesh  India.In 1976  when a teen aged Bihari approached a bank to approve a loan  he was informed that he was actually dead. Death was a strange experience for Bihari. His friend  a "lekhpal"  (low-level buereaucrat) insisted  "Take a look at this  you are dead". Lal Bihari was quite irritated with his friend as he recently had tea with him a few weeks before.
