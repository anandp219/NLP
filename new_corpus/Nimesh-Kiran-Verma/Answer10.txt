  The popular book and movie The Secret has a simple message which it calls the Law of Attraction. The message is that whatever you think about (wealth  or poverty  happiness or misery  love or isolation) the universe will deliver to you. You attract to yourself that which you imagine.This message has a clear appeal. It offers a one-size-fits-all solution to life's large and small problems. All of them.Part of me thinks The Secret holds valuable truth. If I am caught in a traffic jam  I have a choice.
