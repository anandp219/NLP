  Short answerLong answerThere are very few characters in literature who instill pride and inspiration in common folks. Abhimanyu is surely one such character.The Chakravyuha or Padmavyuha was a special formation and knowledge of how to penetrate it was limited to only a handful of Pandava warriors  namely Abhimanyu  Arjuna  Krishna and Pradyumna.However  to the Pandavas' disappointment  Pradyumna  son of Krishna  chose not to participate in the Kurukshetra war. Abhimanyu  son of Arjuna  knew how to penetrate the Padmavyuha but not how to exit it  leading to tragic consequencesThe thirteenth day of Mahabharat war is remembered for the construction of Chakravyuha by Dronacharya.By the inspiration of Duryodhan  Drona chalked out a plan to trap Yudhisthira the main lead of the Pandavas and hence win the war at one sweep.Dronacharya knew that Arjun and Sri Krishna had the skill of penetration and exit through Chakravyuh so both of them were purposefully drawn in to a separate battle with the Samsaptakas.Now the challenge of the Chakravyuh was sent over to the Pandavas' side.As planned Yudhisthir had no other option of himself accepting the challenge as the Krishna and Arjun were busy in a battle far away from head quarters  hence inaccessible.To his aid came young Abhimanyu.He knew  he has only the partial knowledge of Padmavyuh  but to a brave kshatriya like him  fulfilling his Dharma of protecting his King is must.He also had confidence (may be over confidence) and hope of winning the vyuh with the help of his mighty uncles.But Kauravas with the help of Jayadratha were successful in hindering four of the five pandavas from entering the chakravyuha (by making use of a boon granted to him by Lord Shiva) and thus brutally killing Abhimanyu in the end by violating the norms of wars.Abhimanyu though sacrificed his life  was very effective in holding all the Kaurava maharathis (Great Charioteers  colloquially Great Warriors) at bay and thereby preventing the advancement of Kaurava forces towards the Pandavas.Hence avoiding  a certain defeat of his side.Also(as suggested by User)" Abhimanyu was actually the soul of a daitya named Kalyavana.
