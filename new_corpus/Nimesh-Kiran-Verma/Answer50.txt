  Undoubtedly Christopher NolanBecause Nolan has mastered the art of turning mindless entertainment into something that requires you to think. All his films  even the early and underrated "Memento " are like an intricate painting. They are beautifully crafted and involve layers upon layers of meaning  and ultimately the viewer can interpret it any number of different ways. It's impossible to leave the theater without arguing about whether or not what you saw really just happened. His ideas are so fresh and so well put together that it's impossible not to take notice.
