In his recent book  Stumbling on Happiness  Dan Gilbert cleverly and comically argues that we spend much time trying to provide for our future selves the things that we think they will want  only to find our future selves ungrateful and disappointed. On the flip side  we end up happy with things we never thought we wanted. As adolescents  we may have shuddered at the thought of ending up as ordinary  boring adults. When we become ordinary  boring adults  those ordinary  boring things like buying a house and having children are milestones more meaningful than our adolescent selves with their limited vision could have imagined.I'm not sure I want total control over my future.
