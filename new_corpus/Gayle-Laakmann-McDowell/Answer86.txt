Why on earth not?Pregnancy is hard -- really hard. It sucks even when you want to have a kid  and I can't imagine how much worse it'd be if you don't want to. Raising a child (or giving up a child up for adoption) is even harder. These are not reasonable "punishments" for a couple's irresponsibility. I don't want to force a woman to go through pregnancy and then adoption/child-raising just because she was irresponsible.In fact  do you really want the woman who was repeatedly irresponsible and doesn't want a baby to be forced to raise a child?
