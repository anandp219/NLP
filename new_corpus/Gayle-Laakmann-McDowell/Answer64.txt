  "Shameful"? Yikes!Even so: No  it won't be released on the same day. It's not really possible.The way that the book is printed in India is different from the US. In order to make the book affordable in India prices  I have to do bulk print runs. It takes time -- an unpredictable amount of time -- to get that ramped up. The printer also isn't quite as tightly integrated with Amazon and Flipkart (through no fault of theirs). That also causes a delay as books have to actually be shipped to a warehouse.By contrast  in the US  when I say "go"  it's available that day or the next day.I suppose I could just arbitrarily hold up the US release until it's released in India  but that doesn't help anyone.
