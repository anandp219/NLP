I am not inherently Gayle McDowell; I am me and people happen to refer to me as Gayle McDowell.Convention is to use the current pointer  not the then-pointer (probably because the pointer is designed to be useful  and using an out-of-date one isn't so useful). It'd be quite strange to break from convention specifically to use a transgender person's "original" sex.Additionally  for many transgender people  their original name/pronoun reflects a painful time in their life. They might not want to be reminding of this time themselves.
