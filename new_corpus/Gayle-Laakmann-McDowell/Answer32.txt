  No  certainly not.Let's make sure we're very clear on this point (because a lot of people don't really get this). The letter "n" is in O(n) is a variable that has a specific meaning. It's not a magic letter used for runtimes.An example: is inserting a value in a balanced binary search tree O(N) or O(log N)? Both are valid answers; it depends what N means.If N reflects the number of nodes in the tree  then insertion takes O(log N).If N reflects the depth of the tree  then insertion takes O(N).When someone something like "binary search in an array is O(log N)"  they're being slightly imprecise.
