  No.There are many reasons why unplanned pregnancies happen. Lack of access to contraception.Contraception failing.Rape and/or abuse.Being told that you're infertile.Using contraception incorrectly.In addition  there are reasons why someone might want an abortion  even in a planned pregnancy (for example  fetal and maternal issues).These things happen  but let's be honest. The number one reason for an unplanned pregnancy that leads to an abortion is just people being irresponsible by not using contraception and then deciding they don't want kids.Should they be able to access abortions  despite their stupidity?
