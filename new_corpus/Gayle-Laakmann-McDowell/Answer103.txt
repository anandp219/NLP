  If you actually performed poorly and your interviewer said that  he/she would be a jerk. It would be a bad sign  but mostly because you had an interview where you didn't do well and because you had an interviewer who was a jerk.But  honestly  I find it quite unlikely that your interviewer said this if you didn't do well. It's FAR more likely that in fact you only think you did poorly.See: Why Your Interview Performance is Impossible to Judge (More relevant for software engineering roles  but applicable regardless.
