We all know that they mean that N is the size of the array (what else could it mean? )  so we don't get too bothered by it. But technically  they should define the meaning of N.Given this  nested for loops are not necessarily O(N^2). Here are some examples:Example 1: O(A*W) and/or O(N)This code counts the number of a's in an array of words.123456array = array of words (where all words have the same length)count_of_As = 0for each word in array: for each character in word: if character == 'a': count_of_As += 1This is an O(A * W)  where A is the length of the array and W is length of each word.
