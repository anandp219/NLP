Not so.Concatenating K characters together (naively  in most languages) actually takes O(K^2) time. A very simple explanation of this is that you're continuously creating a new string. The first time you create a string of size 1  then size 2  then size 3  then size 4. The total number of characters allocated O(K^2)  which will take O(K^2) time. (I'm excluding times when the compiler might do some optimization  which is possible  or when the language does something fancier. This is a simple  naive example.
