Right now  he basically looks like the opposite.If I'm wrong and the candidate joined Zenefits anyway  then isn't that what he wants?3. He should not have been so offended by the candidate's actions.So the candidate sees name brand as a "plus." Um  so? Who doesn't see that as a plus?If he thinks that most other candidates don't want the same thing  he's incredibly naive. This is especially true when hiring out of college. Of course they're going to think about long-term career options.I really don't see what's so offensive in this candidate's actions.
