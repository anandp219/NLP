For my kids  I prefer names that are unique but easy to say and spell. Why? Because I like that my name is very unique  but the unique spelling is annoying. So that's what I pick names based on. I want a name that's uncommon enough that he'd rarely meet anyone with that name  but still easy to spell and sounds like a normal name.Interestingly  if you listen to what people complain about with these "unique" names  it's often not about uniqueness or spelling or even newness.Uniqueness: Nevaeh was the 65th most common name  and it's was as high as 25 a few years ago.
