Does it work for Google?As far as if it works for Google: well  let's look at it this way. Virtually every "elite" tech company (Google  Facebook  Microsoft  Amazon  Airbnb  Dropbox  Palantir  etc.) has built its team of software engineers through this process. Unless you're going to argue that a randomly selected group of programmers could have built systems like the ones at those companies  the interview process can't be that bad. Somehow  it's selecting reasonably good people  even if it rejects some good people and hires some bad ones (and even if there's a better way of doing it).This is not to say that Google's process is perfect.
