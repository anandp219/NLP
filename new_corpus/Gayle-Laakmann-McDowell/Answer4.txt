  You're hanging out at home and your buddy is in the other room. You ask him to bring you a cup of water.He walks back into the room with one of the following:Nothing at all: this is the null array.An empty cup: this is the empty list case.A cup with water: this is the non-empty list case.Now  case 1 and 2 might feel the same to you (no water for you! )  but logically  they are different. An empty cup is obviously not the same thing as no cup at all. They just aren't. One is a cup. One is not.The fact that he brought you an empty cup might signal something different than nothing at all.
