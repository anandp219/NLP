It certainly can be (particularly if the person pretends to be smoking pot)  but it's very often not.Which camp does Caitlyn Jenner fall into? Will her costume be worn out of respect (or just to make a cool costume) or for the lolz? There are certainly a great number of people who respect her  either for her bravery in coming out or for her athletic accomplishments (or both). There are lots of others who think she's disgusting and a sin against nature  or something like that. And there are even more who don't really think much about her as a person  so much as a joke.I would strongly suspect that those wearing her costume will be doing it because it's funny.
