She's practically force-feeding her kid. That's a big no-no in the parenting books. But her kid will  if left to his own  eat so little that he'll be unhealthily skinny and deprived of sufficient calories to grow healthy.We don't know what is going on in this situation  but I can certainly imagine situations where it'd be better to disclose this child's autism publicly than to not. Perhaps it makes other people more tolerant of the child's situation and less likely to do things that upset the child (honking  yelling  etc).
