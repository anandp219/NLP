Google's process can identify those people. Many people don't classify those situations as a false negatives since those people haven't in fact accomplished much. I think that's a mistake. You care about what they'll do for you  not what they've done in the past.It's also circular logic  since it's saying that hiring based on prior experience justifies rejecting based on a lack of it. If so  then doesn't hiring based on whiteboard problem-solving skills justify rejecting based on lack of those?Hiring based on prior experience comes with its own set of issues (and its own advantages).6.
