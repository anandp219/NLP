Maybe. Or maybe they'll decide to just reinterview you. Or maybe you'll wind up somewhere else in the end. None of these are ideal situations  but at least you will have no longer gotten ahead via dishonesty. If you do confess  I wouldn't use the word "cheating." I would just describe the situation honestly:Although I'm really excited about the opportunities at <company>  I wanted to be honest about my interviews. While the interviewers asked me questions  I looked up answers online. I feel that this might have been a key factor in the offer decisions and I feel pretty uncomfortable about this at an ethical level.
