They're her responsibility  right?That's the message that's being sent when we create a "controversy" from her personal decisions  and that's horrendously unfair to both mothers and fathers. We need to stop denigrating the role of fathers in society and we need to stop assuming that the woman is the "primary" parent.Anyone can be the "primary" parent -- or they can even be equals!But at the end of the day  it's her choice.Ultimately  regardless of what "message" she sends  it's unfair to expect her to make a choice that is not right for her.
