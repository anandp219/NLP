  It depends on how core that built-in library is to the essence of the question. Generally  you shouldn't replace the essence of the interview question with a built-in library. So writing array.sort() when I ask you to sort an array would be defeating the point of the problem (which is to see how elegant your code is).But  if your solution merely relied on the array being sorted but it wasn't really the point of the question  then please do use the built-in library.That said  it's sort of an irrelevant question.
