  China officially has a high literacy rate of 96.4% (CIA The World Factbook 2015).However this rate is misleadingly high  and illiteracy is actually quite common.As long as you pass a fourth-grade exam  you are considered literate  even if later you are no longer able to read or write (Illiteracy Jumps in China  Despite 50-Year Campaign to Eradicate It). You only need to know 950 Chinese characters you are considered literate  but as Victor Mair  Professor of  Chinese Language and Literature at UPenn notes we know from pedagogical standards outside of China that this figure is woefully inadequate for functioning as a literate member of a society that uses Chinese characters for daily communication in a variety of fields  literature  news media  instructional manuals  high school and college textbooks  and so forth.
