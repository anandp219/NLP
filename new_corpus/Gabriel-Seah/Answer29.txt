Instead of Satan/The Devil  it is "patriarchy"- It has an assumption of infallibility and a refusal to question its basic assumption - that of "patriarchy"- There is fierce internecine dissent among its adherents about what seems (to outsiders) to be relatively minor ideological (theological) points  and condemnations of those who have sinned and fallen short (Theres no point in online feminism if its an exclusive  Mean Girls club)- Feminists condemn others as "not real feminists" or otherwise contest other people's adoption of the feminist label - this is like claims that specific Muslims aren't "true Muslims" or the chiding of "Sunday Christians"- There is an eschatological promise: of a Utopia when Patriarchy is finally dismantled and the feminist paradise arrives- There is a perpetual fallacy of pointing to what feminism is in theory rather that what it is in practice.
