Indeed  feminist philosophy emphasises the ethics of care over traditional conceptions of morality (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy).Ethics (the study of morality) is a major part of philosophy so given that women are more relational in their morality than men  it would stand to reason that they would be less able to relate to philosophy and so be less interested in it.Beyond that  Simon Baron-Cohen (The Essential Difference front page) has found that the female brain is predominantly hard-wired for empathy  and that the male brain is predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systemsPhilosophy like physics (another field where women are underrepresented) is a systemic discipline which works on universal principles  which could explain why women are less interested in it.
