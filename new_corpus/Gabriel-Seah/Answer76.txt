  The short answer is that you can't really do that.News outlets are free to publish what they want and  at least in a free country  there's no easy way to force them to be entirely truthful (instead of peddling half-truths).If what they have published is technically true  as in the Gawker story  one would not be able to hit them for defamation (or libel  where the name depends on the jurisdiction). And in the Gawker story it's not entirely clear what sort of damages the family would be able to prove anyway.Probably the best way to mitigate the trend of misleading news articles (which feeds into the clickbait phenomenon which is ultimately driven by ad revenue [Taboola: The internet firm at the forefront of 'click-bait' - BBC News]) is to employ critical news literacy.
