  It makes me think of Martin Luther King  Junior:I have a dream that I will one day live in a public space where what I say will not be judged by the color of my skin  my gender  my sexual orientation  my sexual identity  my class  my physical ability  my education  my gender identity or my religious affiliation  but by the content of my words.I have a dream today.Or something like that.I feel sad that social equity movements have been hijacked and perverted  such that a person is judged based on his race  sex or other characteristics (the opposite of what you would imagine their aims to be).I feel indignant that someone is dismissing what I am saying not by addressing what I am saying  but who I am.I feel annoyed that such an intellectually lazy and fallacious argument is being used - a combination of ad hominem and poisoning the well.I feel exasperated because I know that nothing I say can ever get through to the person - he has already made up his mind about me by my membership in various demographic groups and fit me in a stereotype..
