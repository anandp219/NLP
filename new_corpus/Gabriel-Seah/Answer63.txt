  Yes they do.It's a winter dish so you find it more in the North of Vietnam  during the cold season.I have visited Hanoi twice - once in May (Summer) and once in December/January (Winter)  and I only saw (and tried) it in winter. I only saw it once  but that probably has to do with the fact that places are unlikely to advertise it on their English menus (fortunately I saw it on one).As for whether it's healthy  presumably it's no more or less healthy than any other meat  assuming the dog was reared hygienically.
