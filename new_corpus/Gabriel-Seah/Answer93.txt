(Piers:Id love to hunt with Walter Palmer so I can stuff and mount him)Nevermind that Palmer is not fat. Nor is he a businessman. And there doesn't seem to be any evidence that he is greedy  selfish or murderous (by definition you can't "murder" an animal).He is a hunter  so he must be a corporate fatcat!Similarly  the ban on fox hunting in England is at least as much about class as protecting foxes from cruelty (Fox hunts thrive in Britain  but class-tinged controversy won't go away).Generalised online misanthropyBy now if you're not living under a rock you must have heard about at least one Internet witch hunt.The glee expressed by many people as they fantasise about torturing Walter Palmer is really disturbing.
