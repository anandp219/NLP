However private prostitution continued. Prostitution was never legally sanctioned until the Republic of China was established in 1911.In 1920 Shanghai  theShanghai Municipal Council calculated that more than 70 000 prostitutes were in the foreign concessions... If these gures are approximately correct  then in the French Concession in 1920  where there were 39 210 female adults on the population registers  one in every three women was a whore (Sun Guoqun 1988:-4). Altogether  it was estimated at the time that Shanghai's ratio of one prostitute to every 157 inhabitants was the highest among major world cities; Tokyo's ratio being 1:277; Chicagos  1:457; Pariss  1:481; Berlins  1:582; and Londons  1:906 (Yang Jjiezeng and He Wannan 1988:1).
