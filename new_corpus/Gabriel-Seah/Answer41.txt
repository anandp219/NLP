  I've been to many countries in Europe (the UK  France  Spain  Italy  the Benelux  Germany  Italy  Austria  Poland  the Baltics  Greece)  and in virtually all restaurants in most countries tap water is provided - on request.The only recent exception I can think of is a one-star Michelin restaurant I went to in Barcelona  but I wasn't expecting them to provide tap water anyway.Of course  most places would rather you pay money for at least still or sparkling water  if not an even more expensive drink  but some restaurants do provide it without you even asking.It must be said that in many countries the locals usually don't drink the tap water  which makes the restaurants even less likely to give it without being asked.
