  Yes.A Norwegian study found that couples who share the housework are more likely to divorce than those with an unequal division of the chores (Couples who share the housework are more likely to divorce  study finds - Telegraph).The researchers suggest that this is partly because where there clear gender roles  there is less dispute between a couple. Feminists  then  with their insistence on eliminating gender roles  would have more contention in their relationships about gender roles and whether the split of responsibilities is gendered.Furthermore  the more modern a couple  the less sacred they view marriage.
