  Women are indeed less interested in philosophy than men.There is a well-documented gender gap in Philosophy faculty and graduate programs  and this is also evident in undergraduate enrollment (Page on socphilpsych.org)  with fewer and fewer women as depth of involvement increases - from introductory Philosophy courses to representation of the faculty. The largest drop is between introductory Philosophy courses and Philosophy majors. Notably  out of all the humanities  women are most under-represented in Philosophy.When interviewed (Georgia State tries new approach to attract more female students to philosophy @insidehighered)  female Philosophy students reported that Women generally found the course less enjoyable  and the material less interesting and relevant to their lives  than their male counterpartsThey also had more personal reasons like being unable to identify with coursemates and instructors  but this is irrelevant where this question is concerned.It could be that women don't like philosophy because philosophy is largely based on principles  whereas women are more relational in their reasoning.Carol Gilligan criticises Kohlberg's stages of moral development (Page on barnard.edu) which puts principled moral reasoning as the apex of moral development  since women are more relational in morality.
