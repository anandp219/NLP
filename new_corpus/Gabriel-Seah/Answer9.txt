When a woman is licentious  she is to be seized and held inside a room  and not allowed to leave. When a man is licentious  his genitals are to be cut off(Source 5)(I find this bit puzzling given how open China historically was about prostitution - perhaps someone else can shed light on it)At one point premarital sex was officially grounds for expulsion at all Chinese universities (Chinese universities may alter tough sex rules) and at one sex between men and women was labelled prostitution (Guangdong college says all student sex is 'illegal prostitution'  threatens expulsion).An instructive comparison can be made with another  nearby East Asian country - Japan.
