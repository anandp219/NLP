Not all of these factors are explicitly linked to prostitution being open or acceptable  but I would argue that ubiquity tends to normalise an activity.Sexual Attitudes of Chinese WomenChinese women (like East Asian women in general [Source 6]) are sexually conservative  so Chinese men "resort to prostitution for their sexual demand"; where women are more free with their sexual favours  men are less likely to pay for them. For example  a 1992 survey found that 33% of men in the US who turned 20 in the 1950s had paid for sex  but thanks to the sexual revolution and women's lib  in the 1990s the rate dropped to as low as 5% (The University of Chicago Magazine: October 2002).Sexual RepressionChina is also a sexually repressed society.
