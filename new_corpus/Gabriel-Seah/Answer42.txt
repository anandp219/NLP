  The Importance of GradesGrades are really important in Singapore.You need good grades to get into the school that you want  to get a scholarship to study abroad and to get into the university and course of study of your choice.On top of it  many employers look at your grades and course of study when hiring (even for jobs unrelated to the field of study - Engineering for example is a desired degree even for non-engineering jobs). "Good honours" is a common line in job ads (while tuition at the university level is rare  tuition at lower levels gives you a boost which helps you get into the course of your choice  and arguably bolsters your foundations so you can do well later).
