I think I tried to explain the reason OP's 'choice' may be considered objectionable by people. This is what OP asked in the first place. If he wanted people to agree with him no matter what  he should not have posted the question on a public forum.Furthermore  some commenters have accused me of giving a 'societal' perspective to an 'individual' question. Well  I wrote at the outset that  as an individual  OP has the right to choose what he wants  but that it is important for him to distinguish his choice from his entitlements and to also understand why others find his choice problematic.]
