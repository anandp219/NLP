Saying 'girls are for beauty' doesn't become alright just because you also say 'boys are for intelligence'. A couple of answers here seem to suggest that it's okay for someone to peddle patriarchal stereotypes if everyone is equally insulted. Sorry  but it doesn't work that way. Saying that boys shouldn't / can't cook is as bad as saying that girls shouldn't / can't  say  drive. Both perpetuate hetero-normative gender stereotypes. Palash Sen's comments feed into the very same patriarchal stereotypes  and are hence being considered to be in bad taste.
