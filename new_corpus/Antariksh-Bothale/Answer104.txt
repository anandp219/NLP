  I mean  I can understand if we want more people to know about Sanskrit  but I don't get the obsession with wanting to revive it  or trying to shove it down people's throats. The sad part is that when it comes to nationalistic sentiments  we are faced with a perilous dichotomy:At one end  we have a breed of Indians who feel ashamed of showing any association with their cultural background. These are the kind for whom Yoga was uncool until the west appropriated it and made it fashionable. On the other end  you have those who credit everything from Cold Fusion to In-Vitro Fertilization to ancient Indian culture and spread half-truths and outright lies.
