  This is not really a dilemma if you handle it well. You can definitely teach your kid English without having to choose between making her 'lose her roots' or 'grow up to ridicule'.For the first 7-8 years of my life  I was raised by my mother's parents. My grandfather knew English but no one else in the house did. Moreover  I grew up in Madhya Pradesh (a core Hindi state) in a Marathi household. My grandfather is a thoroughly self-made man  and can be counted on to understand the impact of tiny (dis)advantages early in life.
