How many of you who are right-handed have noticed that the desks in many classrooms are much more difficult to use if you are left-handed? If you hadnt noticed this so far  that does NOT mean that you hate left-handed people. It doesnt mean that you dont want to help them. It just means that you have hitherto been completely unexposed to the problems of being left-handed because you have been lucky enough to have the world designed for the default setting that you belonged to. And that is perfectly fine.
