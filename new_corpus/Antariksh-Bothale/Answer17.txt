  Consultancy firms usually like to see excellence in whatever you want to do (usually called spikes in the resume  and I will use that term here without loss of generality) and in my experience with the IIT process  usually aren't too picky about any one kind of excellence. The ideal profile of course has more than one spike  but I have seen loads of people getting shortlisted for interviews with excellence in just 1 domain (or a bunch of very closely related domains). Some of the 'standard' examples (but by no means exhaustive) of strong profiles in particular domains are:AcademicTop of the class with a very good CPI (say DR 5 or better  and 9+).
