Ultimately  unreasonable or excessive expectations are not going to be met with compliance. They are going to be met with defiance and deception. The question is  do you want them to live lives so secret that you don't even know them as persons any more  or do you want to actually be connected with who they really are? If you want to be a part of their lives  you'd have to relax a bit on trying to judge and control them.Note that this does not even need to be directed to your kid. If you make disapproving remarks about your neighbor's son getting a girlfriend  be assured your son is going to hide his from you.
