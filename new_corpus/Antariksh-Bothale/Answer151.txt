At its more general level  the GRE is for checking your general aptitude for graduate studies.For instance  while many people whine about the Analytical Ability (Verbal) section of the GRE  I think it is actually pretty useful. The expectation is that a person with Graduate level education (no matter what the field) has a fairly high amount of analytical and reasoning skills  along with the ability to correctly analyze texts  draw logical inferences  and express their thoughts in a cogent and cohesive manner.
