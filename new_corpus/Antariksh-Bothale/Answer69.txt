  The US gets a lot of flak for not using the metric system in everyday life. Why they don't change is easy to understand (it's a huge pain in the ass  with hardly any return). But it's not like the metric system is a perfect  universally applicable system.Powers of 10 are great for scientific calculations  but they are mostly terrible for visualization or approximation in everyday life. A centimeter is often too small and a meter often too big  and no one uses decimeter  so it doesn't matter that it exists.
