Even in places like India  where most people in the service industry (such as in fast-food places and so on) speak in English  and where English is relatively more common in every day life  we love listening to foreigners speak Hindi (or whatever the relevant local language is)  even if it is just a terribly mispronounced "NuhMUHsTay". In some cases  though  especially in countries whose local language is spoken no where else  and where English literacy levels are very high  people are sometimes reluctant to talk to outsiders in the local language.
