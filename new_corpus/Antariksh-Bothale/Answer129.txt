If youve taken a low-ranking branch despite getting a high rank  youd be called stupid. If youve opted for Dual Degree when your rank allowed you to choose BTech  youd be called stupid. If you let it be known that you intend to do research in Meta  youd be called stupid. You will soon realize that  as a freshie  its very easy to be called stupid..Its also equally devoid of content. By giving in to department stereotypes  you not only straitjacket yourself  you fall prey to years of prejudice. Choosing Meta is not stupidbut whiling the first two semesters away because you were told Meta is a lukkha branch is.
