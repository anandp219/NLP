  But what I do believe is that being a virgin myself and having decided not to lose it before marriage ( yeah! that may sound alien  but that is true!)   I deserve to ask for a virgin girl. Well  deserve is a fairly loaded kind of word  and I don't think you necessarily deserve anything in such a case  so it'd be best to not approach the issue with a sense of entitlement. Your decision to not have sex before marriage is just thatyour decision. Others may not care. That's theirs.At an individual level  it is of course perfectly alright for you to want a wife who shares your ideals of pre-marital celibacy  just like it is alright for you to have a preference for blue eyes or long hair or dimples or short height or whatever succeeds in generating the right chemical cocktail in your body.
