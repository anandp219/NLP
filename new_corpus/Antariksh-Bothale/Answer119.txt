  Most social niceties are a 'waste of time'. But we extend them out of basic courtesy. The question then isn't about whether it is a waste of time  but whether the context needs you to ask that question.It is always about context. If you are in an office in America  and your colleague is German  you don't need to ask them if they know English. If you have been invited for dinner to a German family with whom you have not previously interacted  it might be nice to confirm that they are comfortable talking in English.
