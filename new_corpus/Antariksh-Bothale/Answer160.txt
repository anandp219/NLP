To my credit  I was never much of a TV-watcher anyway.Financial MattersWe were comfortable but we were not filthy rich  so they shielded me from any day to day financial woes if any  but made sure I still had the 'global picture'. I think that being subjected on a daily basis to the family's financial issues is pointlessly stressful for kids (who can't do anything to solve them anyway)  while completely shielding them from these matters makes them extremely sheltered and they end up with no perspective of where the family stands.By example more than instruction  taught me responsible financial decision making.
