Does he lack respect for women? I don't know nor do I care. So  articles trying to prove that he is not sexist because he treats his coworkers well or because he wrote a song about mothers are not really relevant to the issue. The world probably won't become a better place even if we somehow proved so  because the issue isnt about who he is  but what he did.Specifically over-targeting Palash Sen  baying for his blood  calling for blanket bans on Euphoria  trying to somehow establish that he is sexist and an evil man  and other hyperbolic actions like these serve only to derail the actual issue that the Mood Indigo debacle has highlighted.
