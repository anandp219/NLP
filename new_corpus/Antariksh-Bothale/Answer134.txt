Its a screwed up system where not only is it OK to not study  its actually socially desirable. Instead of going into a hatred spiral where you teach yourself to not give a fuck about academics  try to look at courses and subjects as something potentially interesting. Obviously  neither all courses nor all professors will be fun  but youll be surprised at how much the quality of your experience would improve if you treat academics with slightly more openness.Ask questions. Interact. Maybe read up a bit.
