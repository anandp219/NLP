I didn't grow up witnessing constant shouting matches. When I discuss this with people whose experience has been otherwise  they tell me that parental conflict was a big source of stress during their childhood. I particularly remember the most glowing example of this strategy. In the March-April period of my 12th grade  when all kids sit for various crucial and decisive competitive examinations  I remember that my mother had declared the house to be an absolutely zero-conflict zone  meaning that no one shouted  bickered or had unnecessary arguments in the house for those 4-5 weeks.
