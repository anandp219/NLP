So  it's a simple question of pragmatics outweighing everything else. A lot of people are not specifically enthusiastic about going out of their way to learn a new language. I mean  they would probably try to learn basic vocabulary and some abuses (which everyone loves to pick up)  but they will do only as much is necessary to get by. If they are naturally immersed in the language  they would largely pick it up organically anyway. So I don't think it's so much about hesitation as about not having to.
