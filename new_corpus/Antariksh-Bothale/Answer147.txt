A third of the world speaks Mandarin (or a close variant). Who cares? They are all largely concentrated in one part of the world. The Chinese stand to gain much more by learning English than the other way round. Likewise for Bengali. It's spoken by 210 million people. A very impressive figure  until you realize that most of them are in a very small part of the world (West Bengal and Bangladesh).Now let's move to Indian languages. As a language spoken in several Indian states  and understood to some extent by most of North India  Hindi lends itself more naturally as a lingua franca even in places that don't have it as a native language.
