As Eivind says in Eivind Kjrstad's answer to Is there a gender-neutral term for feminism?  the term would be fine "if the world we live in was roughly balanced between women and men"  which it isn't.There is a FB group called "IITians against rape". It's a bunch of very well-meaning people  but I find the name rather hilarious. Being against rape is like the most trivial lower bound I expect IITians (or any decent human being) to pass; however  as I pointed out in Let's get rid of the misogyny  shall we?  well-meaning people who do not rape can still behave irresponsibly in other ways.
