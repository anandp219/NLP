  My experience has largely been with scholarship/fellowship interviews  consulting interviews and CS coding interviews. At least in an interview setting  the tell me about yourself question is a pretty useful conversational starter and is often used by people to break the ice and make the interviewee comfortable. It is important that you dont get tensed up; instead  use this question to ramp up the interview. Jaime has talked about the kind of content you should have in your 'About Me'. A few more pointers:Avoid rambling: Sometimes  when people haven't thought of what they want to say  they end up talking incoherently for a long time.
