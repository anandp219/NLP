If everyone's gonna spell English their way (and they should be allowed to  if the whole point was to spell it purely phonetically)  is this less chaotic  or more chaotic  than the status quo?Check out the variation in the caught-cot merger in North America (Source: Wikipedia). Mind you  this is just one particular variation. Furthermore  even if you did choose a dialect  what kind of speech should you accurately represent? A word spoken carefully as an individual utterance can sound very different from the same word spoken in a sentence  and even that can change based on stress and other factors.
