For me  that's the gift of a lifetime. I do a happy little dance when I read such messages and I try my best to reply to every one of them. To be honest  sometimes I get so ecstatic that I go to tell my mom and I forget to reply all together; it's not something that I'm proud to admit  but it's the truth.Thank you Quora for letting me share my stories  experiences  and advice with the world. Thanks to my followers who upvote  comment  share  and message me to let me know that I'm doing a good job.
