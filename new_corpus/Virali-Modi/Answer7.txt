For internet  he has to buy minutes for 3G which gets used pretty quickly.I asked him what it felt like to live in Harare versus when he was here in Mumbai for a month. He said that he'd rather live and earn in Mumbai  even if he's earning in rupees  rather than live in Zimbabwe were he's earning in dollars. He said that it's terrible living there; they grow most of their own vegetables in fruits in the backyard  but dairy  meats  and grains are something that they have to buy and it becomes difficult when you have to feed a family of four.I know it's not much help  but I hope I was able to provide something worthwhile in this answer.
