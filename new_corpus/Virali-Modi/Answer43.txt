Even if there isn't much to talk about  it's nice to have a cup of coffee/tea with each other.The best thing  in my opinion  is to have a home cooked meal. I stay with my parents  so having my mom prepare something with her loving hands always cheers me up and brings me joy. Especially if it's something that's my favorite.TL;DR: Laughter  family  love  and food.
