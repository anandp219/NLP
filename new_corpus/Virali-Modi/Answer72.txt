I've stopped drinking since August of this year and I knew I'd end up taking care of anyone that got too tipsy.Now  this party wasn't an ordinary party; most of the people there were on wheelchairs. There were only a couple of people there who could walk  (this bit of information is really important). It was about three in the morning and two of our friends went to get some alcohol. All the girls that were there are light weights  they almost never drink more than two glasses of red wine. Well  the boys came back with the alcohol.
