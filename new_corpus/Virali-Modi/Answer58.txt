Look  I don't believe in fortune telling  palmistry  astrology  and other forms of fortune reading. I believe in hard work that comes from deep within the heart. I'll tell you something though  her words hit me like stone. I felt that she was extremely right. I do think too much about my future  especially about my legs. You won't believe this  but I do ask myself  "What if I don't walk? What will I do? How will I survive?" Shocking  right?Guess what I did today? I went to therapy  and from this morning  I stopped thinking about my future and my legs.
