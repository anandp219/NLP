Gradually  I gained that sensation back and I have a normal diet now.Another thing that most people take for granted is the ability to use the restroom. I have a catheter  a tube that's inserted into my urethra which connects to my bladder. I have to change that tube every fifteen days because I could get a severe infection that could damage my kidneys. You do not understand how painful it is. Along with that  imagine how embarrassing it is. People  if you have a normal functioning bladder  please don't ever take that for granted.In conclusion  please do not take your body parts for granted whatsoever.
