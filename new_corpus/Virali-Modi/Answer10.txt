Your 20's are really important  you have the time to learn about yourself  experiences different things  you can take adventures  and guess what  you don't need friends to do that.Having a girlfriend is great  but the chances of finding someone that doesn't understand you  doesn't care for your feelings  and can easily hurt you are high. I don't know if you've been in a relationship before or not  but if you don't exactly know what you want from a relationship  things can get difficult and messy.
