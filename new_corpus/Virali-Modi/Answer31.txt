  In my case  I was betrayed by both of my exes. It didn't take me a long time to get back into a relationship; rather it took me about three to four months.My first ex cheated on me  on my birthday with his friend whom he treated like a sister. My second ex betrayed me by using me for a green card (which he wasn't successful). I guess the betrayal from both of them was what made it easier. Yes  I was hurt and in denial  but I made myself strong. I decided that I deserved much  much better and moved on.
