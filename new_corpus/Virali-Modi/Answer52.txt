I have a tremendously weak long term memory  but my short term memory is quite good. There are many things that I don't remember from my past  things that happened before I got sick. Even now  I have trouble remembering things  people  names  and incidents.The weird thing about this memory problem is that I'm able to remember traumatic events in my life that caused me grief. I cannot remember good and happy memories. [1] Virali Modi's answer to What does it feel like to survive death? [2] Virali Modi's answer to Do people dream during comas?
