The only person I can expect something from is myself. If you feel alone and if you want someone to understand you  grab a book. There are so many books out there  you never know what hidden treasure you'll find in its pages. This has always helped me.I'm really sorry if I was harsh  but the lessons I've learned from the people I thought were my own  was a bitter experience. I don't think you should have to go through that. I genuinely think it's better to be alone than to be around people that don't care.Good luck  OP.
