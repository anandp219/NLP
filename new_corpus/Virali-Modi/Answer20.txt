The monster is going to eat you  but you're stuck  immobile. You do not realize how difficult it is. I don't think anyone can understand or realize that.After getting discharged from the hospital  I couldn't sit by myself without support. I couldn't feed myself  I couldn't even use the bathroom because my muscles weren't functioning. My mom and dad had to feed me. I didn't even have sensation in my stomach. I didn't know when I was hungry or when I was full. On several instances  I overate. I ate so much more than I regularly eat.
