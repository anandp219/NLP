I was expecting a column about my life and struggles  rather it turned into a three page spread in the magazine.I never expected to be so popular or 'famous'  but it's worked out for me  despite my 'disability'. I now truly believe that there's so much more for me in the future  and nothing is holding me back. (Source: Arogya Sanjeevani)
