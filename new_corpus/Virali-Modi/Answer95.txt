  There are many reasons  but I moved here because I wanted more and better treatment options. I've written an answer about that already  Virali Modi's answer to Why would Virali Modi move to India from the US  for medical treatment?.Other than that  I've decided to stay in India because of prospective career in films as an actress and/or model. I've realized that I have better chances of landing a project here in India than I do in the US. Sure  it's a competitive field anywhere I go  but I feel I have an advantage because I'm from the US  so I can play a role of a foreigner if needed  and I have a good hold on Hindi and Gujarati.Other than that  I like staying in India because I feel more comfortable here.
