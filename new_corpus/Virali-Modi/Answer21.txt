Being a foodie  I can't understand how I didn't know when to eat and when not to eat. On one instance  I ate over thirteen roits (basically wheat tortillas). My mom kept making them and my dad kept feeding me until he realized that I don't normally eat that much. From that point on  my mom made a strict schedule for when I'd eat and when I wouldn't. I was on portion control. I didn't know if I was starving or if I was full  like I mentioned before. I don't think anyone can realize how it feels to not know when you're hungry or when you're not.
