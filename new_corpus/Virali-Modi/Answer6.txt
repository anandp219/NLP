There is no scope for engineers in that city and he's getting paid much less than he really should. Their household consists of three earners  his mother  his sister  and him. His father wants to work  but because of his health problems  no one is willing to hire him  due to liability issues.Recently  there has been shortage of water  in the neighborhood he stays in. They barely get water for two to three hours per day  the same case for electricity. They have power only for two hours per day. Living in such a warm country  I experienced how difficult it was to function during that time.
