  I don't work  but I do go for therapy and the gym which equals about eight hours of my life  including traveling time. This might sound corny but I started to watch Friends again  mainly because it makes me laugh and destresses me. I think laughter is the biggest energy drink there is. It's the best way to reenergize yourself.Another thing that helps is to spend time with family. After getting home  I spend time with my parents and talk to my boyfriend; we're people who like to share  maybe even overshare parts of our day  and usually it turns into a laughing contest.
