As you can imagine  there were no improvements. I was the same as I was in 2008.In 2010  I came across a treatment known as Stem Cell Therapy in Mumbai. I went there  I met the doctor and the therapists  and got an evaluation done. They explained the treatment in such detail and showed me their results and research (I also did my own research)  that I was content and ecstatic with it. I went ahead and booked my stay there for the stem cells. I've been going to Neurogen for approximately five years now  and I haven't looked back.
