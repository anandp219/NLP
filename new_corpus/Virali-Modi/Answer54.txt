This ticks me off. Please  read the rules  look at Deepak Mehta's description for an introduction to Quora  it'll really help. Their ignorance is making my feed a nightmare to look at. There are also people who are silent readers. They read  upvote  comment  edit answers and questions  and do the needful in terms of merging questions. I really appreciate you. There are also people who provide answers  most of them are helpful and I think more people should provide more inputs if they're comfortable.I think Indians on Quora is a great idea  we have a place to express ourselves without being judged (hopefully).
