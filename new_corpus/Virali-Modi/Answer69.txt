I was shot down by many  many people  until I came across The Miss Wheelchair India beauty pageant.I participated and I won second place. From that day on  my life changed. People started recognizing me because of the pageant and my writing on Quora. I was interviewed for many newspapers(thanks to the PR department at my hospital)  and I was even on the news. I've had so many articles published on various websites  mainly because of all the media coverage and because of my popularity on Quora.The biggest news yet: I was interviewed for a popular Hindi magazine that's widely circulated throughout America and India called Arogya Sanjeevani.
