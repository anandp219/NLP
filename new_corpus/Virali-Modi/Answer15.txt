I think it's much more than that. I think life is about self-realization  understanding who you are and what you truly desire.You often hear about the person who quit their job to travel the world  that's commendable. Having that experience of other cultures can help you understand what you truly want and who you truly are. These experiences help us shape dreams  they help us understand how blessed we are  and help us understand how much we take for granted.Forgiving ourselves for not accomplishing what we dreamt of is a new concept for me.
