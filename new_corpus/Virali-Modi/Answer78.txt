A couple of days later  he messaged me on Facebook and we started talking  I had no idea who he was until he told me that I declined him on Shaadi. As you can imagine  I was really embarrassed  but we quickly forgot and instantly clicked.It's going to be two years next month  and he's planning on shifting to Mumbai permanently next year.
