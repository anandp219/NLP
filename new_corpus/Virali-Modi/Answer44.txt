  You won't believe anything anyone says until you believe in yourself. I follow one rule in my life: If I can fix it  I don't have any reason to worry. If I can't fix it  why should I worry? Look  I don't know what your problems are  but you need to adapt this way of thinking. If you truly know that you can't fix whatever it is that you're getting paranoid over  then stop thinking about it. Every bad situation will always have a positive ending. Even if you don't believe in that  it's true. Whatever you're going through  will have a good outcome for you.
