I trusted him and I drank  a lot. I usually don't drink more than I can handle  but my uncle kept insisting  so I did.Well  I blacked out  the last thing I remember is that we were dancing  and then nothing. The next morning  I wake up and see my mom staring at me. She started yelling  saying how I was immature and irresponsible (which I agreed to). I told her the story and she called my uncle  he lied. He said that I was already drunk before I met him  which wasn't the case. As you can imagine  things got pretty heated at home.
