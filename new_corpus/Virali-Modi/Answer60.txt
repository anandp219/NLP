Start thinking of other options for your career  you might not be destined to do what you initially planned on. You should always have a backup plan  even for your backup plan. I think that's incredibly important. You think you're not fit? Why don't you start going to the gym? The gym will help you vent your frustration and it'll help you get fit and you'll lose some weight. Along with that  start devoting your time to things that are important to you  hang out with your friends  and try looking at different options to help you with your future.In short: Stop worrying so much and try living your life without thinking too much about your future.
