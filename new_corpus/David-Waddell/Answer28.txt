Many more thousands have made it into the EU  some above the radar as successful asylum seekers and some below the radar as illegal migrant workers.For reasons that are not fully clear to me  many tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands are now trying to make the journey. We imagine most of the refugees are from Syria or IS-controlled territory in Iraq. Things are truly awful in those places and I find it very easy to be sympathetic to those people trying to get their families away  despite the great risks.
