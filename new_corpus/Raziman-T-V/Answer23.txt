Stop trying to impose religion as culture on secular India. Leave the school kids and science out of your political games. And stop trying to rewrite history blaming everything from Sati to the caste system on Muslims.Offer true secularism as an alternative if you feel that Congress is a false secular party. Showing off yourself as a party of Hindus and going for majoritarianism is not doing yourself any favours. Ditch majoritarian laws like insane punishments for possession of beef which affect non-Hindus disproportionately.Next  you need to shave off some of your appendages.
