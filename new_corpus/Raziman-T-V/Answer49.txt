  The authority that feminism has to fight in India is tradition and religion. Indians - men and women alike - value these so much that any changes are resisted if they question them  even when they are beneficial. Had injustice been inflicted by an external authority  people would have found it easy to protest.The two major religions in India are Hinduism and Islam. The former proclaims that women do not deserve freedom (Na sthree swathanthryam arhati [1])  and the latter tells its followers that men are caretakers of women (Arrijalu qawwamoona ala nnisai [2]).
