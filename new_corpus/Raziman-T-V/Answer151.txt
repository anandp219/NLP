Bazaar was about bride-buying from poor Muslims by expatriates. I am sure that there have been various other movies in other Indian languages about those issues  such as the Malayalam films Paadam Onnu: Oru Vilapam about the problem of early marriages among Muslims in Kerala  Uppu about polygamy  and Alif about women's issues. As Pankaj Tripathi points out  movies criticising problems with Islam have been made even in Pakistan.In short  I believe that Indian movies till now have focused on only criticising certain aspects of religion (as supertsitions and "fake religious" practices)  at the same time glorifying religion and spirituality instead of questioning them.
