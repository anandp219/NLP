  If all the numbers were powers of a certain prime p  how would you solve the problem?Let the numbers be [math]p^{e_1}  p^{e_2} \ldots p^{e_N}[/math]  with [math]e_1 \geq e_2 \geq e_3 \ldots e_N[/math]. The gcd of a subset is just the smallest power of [math]p[/math] in the subset. For making things simple  when there are multiple equal numbers  we will say that the highest index number is what is chosen as the gcd. That is  if [math]e_1=e_2[/math]  we will say that [math]\gcd(p^{e_1} p^{e_2})[/math] is actually [math]p^{e_2}[/math].With this  let us see how many subsets [math]p^{e_i}[/math] is the gcd of.
