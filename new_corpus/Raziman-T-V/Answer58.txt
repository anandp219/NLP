Nearly every Dalit alive today knows how much they owe to this man  and adores him - practically worshipping him. Muslims do not have such a direct relationship with him and do not appreciate him as much  since his contributions to modern India are not covered so much in the textbooks compared to Gandhi or Nehru.Personally  I have immense respect for him - especially with my Muslim identity.My first serious encounter with Ambedkar was when his biography was part of the reading material for one of the quiz competitions in my state.
