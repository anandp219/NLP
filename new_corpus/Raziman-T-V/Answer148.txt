As a result  I have seen even staunch Hindus love these movies and not feel that they say anything bad about Hinduism. There have been better treatments of controversial practices in Hinduism such as Diksha before  and I believe that movies questioning things such as the caste system in Hinduism would be more of a "problem" to Hinduism than these movies. But nobody makes movies about such serious issues.Now coming to your question  Why movies about Hinduism and not Islam?The first reason is that very few movies are made about Muslim society in India in general.
