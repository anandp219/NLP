  If the city blocks are coloured black and white alternately like cells of a chessboard  every street connects a black block with a white block.Let us first state the problem in graph theoretic terms. We will denote the blocks by vertices of the graph and the streets by edges between them. The problem then reduces to this : Given the degree of every vertex in a graph but one  find the degree of that vertex.Now  for a general graph  it turns out that this problem cannot be solved. To see this  consider the two graphs below:Both graphs have vertices A and B with degree two.
