Do not look at a Muslim woman with prejudice merely because she is wearing Islamic clothing. You can say nothing about how free or empowered she is based on what she wears. And please try not to "force-empower" them by banning Islamic dressing  especially in educational institutions and employment. Education and financial independence are the way to individual freedom  and banning Islamic clothing from these places will just result in many Muslim women leaving these avenues voluntarily or involuntarily.
