Keep a stack to store the candidate lowest lines. Initially push the first line to the stack. The initial candidate range at which this line is lowest is [math](-\infty \infty)[/math].While processing an element [math]l[/math]  first check the intersection of the line with the line [math]m[/math] at the top of the stack. If the intersection point is before the candidate range at which [math]m[/math] is the lowest  it means that [math]m[/math] can never be the lowest line for any range (This is what happened to [math]l_3[/math] in the above figure) - so pop m off the stack.
