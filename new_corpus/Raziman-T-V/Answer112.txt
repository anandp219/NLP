Section 377 is the law of the land in India  but the existence of the law does not make persecution of gays just. At least the Muslims who believe that they should have the right to practice and propagate Islam and build mosques in non-Islamic nations should support the same rights for non-Muslims in Islamic nations as well.Finally  I hope that people living in secular nations like India would realise that such oppressive laws in nations like Saudi Arabia are not a model to be followed but avoided at all costs.
