Women joining politics were portrayed as wanting women to dominate men. Those advocating clothing freedom and social freedom were depicted as scantily clad and getting drunk in nightclubs with men. Think about all movie stereotypes about feminists from a couple of decades ago. We just cannot imagine a family and social structure where women do not live their traditional roles.To me  that is the basis of the problem. The society simply cannot accept even the basic  reasonable demands of feminism.
