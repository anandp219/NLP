Admittedly  I watched the movie primarily because Ambedkar was portrayed by Mammootty. That was a very well-made movie and a very moving portrayal of the man and his struggle. I then actively read about him a bit  and was more attracted to him.Even ignoring his humble beginnings  what he did was monumental. Had he not existed  the condition of Dalits and backward communities in India would have been abysmal (not that it is particularly great even today). He is the reason SC/STs have representation in legislature today.
