And I will make sure that I don't force my personal habits which go against your religion on you. I will not steal or disrespect your cow. And when I buy beef from someone who slaughtered a cow they did not consider sacred and cook it  I will make sure that I don't feed it to you. If you demand that all food items containing beef and all materials made using beef carcasses at some point be marked prominently  I will support your demand as well.Isn't that what pluralism and tolerance are all about?
