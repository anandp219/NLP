Even if there is no compulsion  there is the invisible social pressure  not very different from any other peer pressure. An interesting contrast in the Indian context would be the Saree. It is a much more complicated piece of clothing to wear  and is quite restrictive. Yet  many Indian women wear Sarees every time they leave home. Is it purely out of choice? Would they have continued to wear the Saree if that was absolutely not a social expectation from them? I don't think so.Finally we have women who are forced to wear Islamic clothing.
