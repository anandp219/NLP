The tables rightwin(i k) and leftwin(i j) can be filled in O(N) and thus  win(i j k) can be computed for all values in O(N).It seems we can still do betterFor this  we have to finally use the fact that the range wraps around. Suppose we want i to win. Imagine all the players standing in the circle and duelling each other till only two are left : i and some i'. All the musketeers between i and i' (clockwise) have to be defeated by one of them (or someone who defeated them...). Similarly  all musketeers between i' and i (clockwise) have to be defeated too.Thus we modify the definition of our rightwin function slightly:rightwin(i k) = 1 iff i and k can defeat everyone in the range (i k) togetheri can survive the full set of duels if there exists some i' such that rightwin(i i') = rightwin(i' i) = 1 and i can defeat i'.
