  As a group  I don't think that Indian Muslims think too much about Ambedkar.He is just known as one of the major figures related to Indian independence but that's it. I remember my Usthads mentioning Gandhi and Nehru in my Madrassa  but never Ambedkar.This is due to two reasons:Ambedkar's contributions are not given sufficient weight in the school history textbooks or in popular cultureAmbedkar did not directly influence Muslims the way he influenced DalitsAmbedkar was the leader of Dalits  and brought honour and identity to hundreds of millions of them nearly single-handedly.
