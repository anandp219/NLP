  Here is a geometric proof.We will switch the sign of [math]b[/math] and prove that [math]a^2 - a b + b^2 > 0[/math]  which is identical to the original statement. The result is obvious if [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] have opposite signs. So let us consider the case when [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] have the same sign. Without loss of generality  take [math]a b \geq 0[/math].Consider a triangle with two sides of lengths [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math]  with the angle between the sides equal to [math]\gamma=60^\circ[/math].Schematic of the triangle [1].According to the Law of cosines  we have [math]c^2 = a^2 - ab + b^2[/math].
