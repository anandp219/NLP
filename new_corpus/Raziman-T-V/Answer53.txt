Every woman should be able to decide what she does with her sexuality. She should be able to freely date and marry people she chooses. To me  this is a very fundamental and reasonable expectation of freedom. But we have feminists being labeled as promiscuous sluts for this.That has always been the narrative. Reasonable demands by feminists have been represented as extreme. When women started going out for day jobs  they were painted as heartless and selfish people who wouldn't cook for their husbands (poor man  how can you expect him to work in the kitchen and cook for himself) or care for their children.
