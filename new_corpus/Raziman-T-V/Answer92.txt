But Ahmadiyya belief is that after escaping crucifixion  he moved to Kashmir and lived and died there. Thus Jesus was not the Mehdi awaited in Islam  and Ahmad himself was.Needless to say  Ahmadi beliefs are highly controversial in the mainstream Muslim community. The belief that Muhammad is the last prophet is central to mainstream Islam  and the status of Mirza Ghulam Ahmed in Ahmadiyya belief is unacceptable to non-Ahmadi Muslims. Most Muslims consider Ahmadis to be heretics and Kafirs. As a result  they face persecution in many Islamic nations  especially in Pakistan.
