Coming back to the graph theoretic formulation  the sum of degrees of black vertices is equal to the sum of degrees of white vertices. Using this  the degree of the missing vertex can be found easily.For example  in the sample case  assume that the central (missing) vertex is coloured black and has degree X. The sum of degrees of black vertices is 2+3+X+1+0 = 6+X  whereas the sum of degrees of white vertices is 2+1+3+1=7. Equating  we find the sample output X=1.
