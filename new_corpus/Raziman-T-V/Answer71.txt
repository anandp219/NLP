  Restaurants are extremely expensive in Switzerland. Go to an average restaurant and have an average main dish  and it will cost you 20-25 CHF. Some restaurants give you a student discount  but the price even after the discount is going to be pretty high.The first cheap option you have is fast food restaurants. If you don't care too much about your health  there is a McDonalds in every corner of town that you can use (and other chains like Burger King  though less common). There are also a lot of Doner Kebab shops  and the food there is relatively cheap as well.
