  I do not speak for all Muslims  but I find it completely unjustifiable.I believe that everyone should have the right to practice and propagate their religion. Saudi Arabia prohibits public practice and proselytism by followers of other religions  conversion from Islam  and atheism. Such actions by a theocratic state are clear human right violations. I wish that Saudi Muslims and the international community would put pressure on the Saudi government to change such laws.I have seen some Muslims justify this practice by saying that it is the law of the land  but the point is that such a law itself is unjust.
