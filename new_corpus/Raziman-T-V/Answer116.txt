Since we know that the last post office is at village i  we just consider all possibilities for the location of the previous post office and take the one which gives the minimum cost12345678for i=1 to N for j=2 to K best(i j)=best(i-1 j-1) for k=1 to i-2 best(i j)=min(best(i j)  best(k j-1)+cost(k i)) end endendHere  cost(k i) = minimum distance sum for assigning villages in the range k...i to post offices at village k and i. Note that if we evaluate this naively using a loop from k to i here  the overall complexity of the routine would become O(N^4).
