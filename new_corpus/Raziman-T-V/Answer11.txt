Most traditional Muslims would fume at the thought of a Muslim marrying a Hindu - it really offends them. Should interfaith marriages be banned because of this? Should Hindus break off relationships with their Muslim girlfriends/boyfriends? Definitely not. The individuals involved in the activity have nothing to do with the people getting offended. And those getting offended are not being forced to drink alcohol  eat pork or marry outside their religion.My personal request to you would be to open your mind.
