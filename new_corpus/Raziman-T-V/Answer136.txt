You still get to worship the cow and you still get to not eat beef. When you ask for others to live their lives based on your beliefs  it stops being about communal harmony and tolerance and starts being a political power game of imposing rules on others. When political parties with no standing start asking for beef bans in places like Kerala  it is time to realise that it has become cultural oppression  trying to paint the whole of India in one narrow brush. When political groups start using beef and love-jihad and such scare tactics to raise communal issues  consolidate Hindu votes by portraying Muslims as the other and win elections  it is just a political tool.Giving in to such forces and accepting a nationwide beef ban  for example  would go against the very idea of pluralism and tolerance in India.
