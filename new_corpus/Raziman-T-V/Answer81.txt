  I don't think so.There is a lot of anti-Indian content on Quora. When I see those  I report them. Quora admins are quick to act on such content (random example) and block/ban the askers. I have found them very receptive to the problems faced by Indian users and I feel that there is a genuine effort to make Indians feel at home on Quora.But unfortunately  many Indian users on Quora have the same kind of behaviour. There is a lot of content from Indian users that violate various policies  especially "Be Nice  Be Respectful" policy:Examples of behaviors that violate the "Be Nice  Be Respectful" policy include:Personal attacks  including hurtful  insulting  or hostile comments.Making unjustified accusations against other user(s).Engaging in a pattern of behaviour that constitutes harassment of a targeted person or persons  e.g.  by making threats  repeated annoying and unwanted contacts  repeated personal attacks  or posting personal information.Racial  sexual  homophobic  ageist  religious  political  ethnic  or other epithets directed against another contributor.Using someone's affiliations as a means of dismissing or discrediting their views (this does not include pointing out a conflict of interest of relevance to the discussion at hand).Speculating on the real life identity of an anonymous user.Even prominent users are not immune to this.
