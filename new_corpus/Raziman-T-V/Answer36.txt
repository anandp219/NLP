  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming over subsets (using bitmasks).SolutionThe first thing to note is that [math]b_i < 2 a_i - 1[/math]. This is because  had the inequality not been satisfied  we could have replaced [math]b_i[/math] with [math]1[/math]. This would have resulted in the value of [math]|a_i-b_i|[/math] reducing  without affecting any pairwise gcds. Thus all [math]b_i[/math]s lie between [math]1[/math] and [math]58[/math].One way to make all [math]b_i[/math]s pairwise coprime is by ensuring that prime factors of any element do not divide any other.
