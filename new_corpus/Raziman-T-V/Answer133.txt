  The present beef issue in India is not about religious harmony or tolerance at all. It is all about the rise of political Hindutva ideology.Just like in this question  the beef issue in India is reduced to a Hindu-Muslim issue. In addition to Muslims  many other groups of Indians eat beef. These include Indians from regions like the north-east and Kerala  from other religions like Christianity  and even Dalits.In many parts of India  beef-eaters and cow-worshippers have been tolerating each other for centuries.
