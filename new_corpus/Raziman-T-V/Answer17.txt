  Stop blaming Muslims for the electoral losses of BJP.The last time UPA won the elections at the national level was in 2009. Since you have to be 18 to vote in India  everyone who voted in that election had to be born in 1991 or before. Muslims formed 12.61% of the population of India according to the 1991 census. Even when all the deaths between 1991 and 2009 are taken into account  there would have been six to seven non-Muslim voters for every Muslim voter. It is a pretty unequal contest  don't you think?.How do Muslims vote anyway?
