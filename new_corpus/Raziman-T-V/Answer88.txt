Since the square of the third side has to be positive  we have our result.In fact  we can use the same result for other values of the angle [math]\gamma[/math]. Considering all the angles in the range [math]\left[0 \pi\right][/math]  we obtain that [math]a^2 + x a b + b^2[/math] is always positive for [math]-2 \leq x \leq 2[/math].Alternately  you can think of this as being a weighted mean of two positive numbers [math](a-b)^2[/math] and [math](a+b)^2[/math] with positive weights and is thus positive.
