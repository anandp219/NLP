Note that we have removed all other constraints here - for example  this count includes bags with only red Skittles.Now  more than 200 million Skittles candies are produced daily. Even if this counts the number of pieces and not the number of bags  it would still mean that it takes merely a couple of days to make two identical bags in the worst case.In fact  if you buy merely 2700 bags  according to the calculations for the birthday problem  there is a 0.5 probablity that you would have got two identical bags.
