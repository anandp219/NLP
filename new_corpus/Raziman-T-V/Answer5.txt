Had the number of seats been increased  most of them would have got in without reservation itself. Many a time  the reason to keep cutoffs and entrance exams is just to pick a handful of candidates from a large group. If there are only 100 seats for a course or a job  it does not mean that candidate #101 was unfit for the job - they would have got in if there were 101 seats instead. Especially in the context of India where there are way more qualified candidates than there are educational/employment opportunities available  I would argue that the number of prospective good doctors we have is many times the number of seats and it is all right to pick the best SC/ST/OBC candidates even if they are not at the very top of the rank lists.There would be a difference between reserved and payment seats in this last point.
