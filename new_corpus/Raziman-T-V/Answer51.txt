Not that it doesn't have its faults  but it was a manuscript way ahead of Indian society at the time it was written  and I believe even today. The nation of India was born with universal adult franchise and no legal barriers for women from occupying even the highest constitutional posts. When the law is significantly more progressive than the society  feminist fights have to be more social than political - and this is extremely difficult.Coming back to the social aspect  sexual purity of women is ridiculously overvalued in India.
