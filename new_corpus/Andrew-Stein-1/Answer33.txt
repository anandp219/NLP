  There's not much more to add to what Michael Vogel said. Almost any camera can take horrible or fantastic as long as you are familiar with rules of composure  lighting and exposure. Below are two pictures I took with the same iPhone 6+The lighting in my basement is horrible. Unless I mess around with white balance or try to fix it in an editor  they all end up with a sickly yellowish cast.On the other hand  catching Waffles derping in a sunspot upstairs allowed for more neutral color  interesting shadows  etc.
