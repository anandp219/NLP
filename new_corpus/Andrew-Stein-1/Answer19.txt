It unfortunately encapsulates how most interviews work. There have been volumes written about how the first five minutes of an interview are what really matter  describing how interviewers make initial assessments and spend the rest of the interview working to confirm those assessments. If they like you  they look for reasons to like you more. If they dont like your handshake or the awkward introduction  then the interview is essentially over because they spend the rest of the meeting looking for reasons to reject you.
