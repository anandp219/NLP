  I don't see many similarities between the two characters  other than being played by tall  thin  awkward guys. Kenneth was the lowest man on the totem poll  infinitely naive and cheerful  and ignorant of anything that isn't related to TV or pig farming. Jared  on the other hand  has a management position (head of business management) and has a hand in helping make decisions (even if nobody else really respects him). He isn't unaware of his own awkwardness or others feelings about him and his habit of making death threats in German whilst sleeping hints at a much darker side.
