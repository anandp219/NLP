  Peter Gregory is a caricature of tech billionaires. There's obviously some Peter Thiel in there  but they were aiming for more of a mish-mosh. Below is taken from an interview with Mike Judge from the Financial Times. Judge discusses this issue directly.I tell Judge that I watched Silicon Valley before meeting Peter Thiel  the co-founder of PayPal and the first institutional investor in Facebook. Thiel has a distinctive presence  wide-eyed  nervous  with a habit of making outlandish statements whose impact is masked by a halting conversational style.Some of these tics are embodied with uncanny accuracy by the shows fictional billionaire investor Peter Gregory  played by Christopher Evan Welch.
