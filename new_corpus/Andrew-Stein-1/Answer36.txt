We evolved to prefer the safety of cohesion  even at the cost of accuracy or being factually correct. It was a strategy that served us well as hunter-gatherers  but not so much as office drones in the 21st century. Ethics are defined by the groups you are a member of: your family  peer group  friends  schoolmates  etc. Since we also want to make sure our gene pool survives  we have to make sure our kids conform to group norms as well. Thus we teach our children language  ethics  morals  etc to our kids to make sure they have the best chance of keeping with the pack and avoiding exile.
