  The scene does a couple things:It implies they don't have engineers on the same level as Richard. To be fair  based on the fact that he came up with two revolutionary lossless compression schemes on his own  he's probably one of the very best in his field. However large Hooli's resources are  they don't have the talent that can easily deal with the technical challenges.More importantly  the company is plagued by crippling communication and management issues. Each subordinate is afraid to bring bad news to his/her boss  causing a huge disconnect between those at the very top  like Belson  and the employees who are doing the actual work.
