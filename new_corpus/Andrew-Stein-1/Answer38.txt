  First  get familiar with the concept Heuristics in judgment and decision-making. Barry Hampe mentioned logical fallacies  but also try to learn about Cognitive biases. Basically  our brains evolved to make quick decisions and judgements at the cost of accuracy. Biases alter how we both perceive and judge information  often without our awareness this is taking place. Keep in mind that even learning about biases can't prevent you from committing them. However  awareness can help provide strategies on how you can minimize their impact.
