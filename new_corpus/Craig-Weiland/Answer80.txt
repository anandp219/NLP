I could do all the writing I wanted from anywhere I wanted. I could very easily pack up the machine and take it to work  take it home  take it with me when I visited my parents  take it with me on vacation... I loved that machine. "But it was so heavy!" everyone says.Compared to the Powerbook line  yes. It was heavy compared to them. But it also had a magnificent backlit active matrix displaythe best money could buy at the timeand a lot of other things that  to me  made up the difference. And when the Portable was released  there was no Powerbook line.
