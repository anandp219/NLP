Most people who've been working with me a while trust my advice  but sometimes they just want what they want  whether or not I think it will be effective for them. I have to be able to either communicate that it will not work  or if I can't  try to deliver as good of a product as I can that meets their expectations.At times  the job can be downright nerve-racking  and not everyone understands the amount of time that some projects take to produce. When raw copy and information is delivered to me late  incomplete or incorrect (or all of the above)  it impinges on my sleep  my leisure time and my sanity.
