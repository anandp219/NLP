  When it comes to sports cars  if you have to ask "can I afford it? "  the answer is automatically "no. "60K annually is not nearly enough to justify a 65K vehicle  especially with a 1K monthly mortgage. Your driving record and credit history have no bearing on the matter.No  you can't afford it. Having a 40K nest egg is great! But that money should be working for you. Do not waste that incredible interest-bearing cash pile on something that will depreciate like a bomb. If you haven't already put most of that 40K into Roth mutual funds  you should do it immediately.
