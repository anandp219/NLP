  It takes a certain kind of person to be a successful graphic designer  especially one who really enjoys doing it and is willing to make a career out of it. It requires a combination of audacity and humility  of confidence in one's talent and a willingness to cheerfully surrender it to another's taste preferences. And it demands a willingness to create art that many  many people will see  and be unable to claim any credit for it except privately (or  if you're lucky  design awards shows).This isn't the entertainment business  where everyone who worked on the movieeven the caterers who fed themgets their names on the finished product.
