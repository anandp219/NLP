But the upshot of this is  when I deliver the finished product in spite of these unfortunate setbacks  on time and done right  I get to look like a rock star to my bosses  who do appreciate my efforts. So while sometimes the job is more than a little demanding of one's time  the emotional payoff can be high when you're looking at a finished  great looking printed product in your hands that you'd personally made possible because you busted your ass for the past three weeks straight.I enjoy the creative outlet and the constant challenges.
