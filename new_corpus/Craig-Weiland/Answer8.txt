On those rarer occasions  I'll want the volume a bit higher than usual  and that's when I turn to my speakers' volume control  to crank it up a tad. This is pretty unusual since most of the time I route internet radio through a different computer (which is attached to much better speakers)  but the point is sometimes I'll use the little speakers' volume knob to crank it up for a short while.But 99% of the time I use the keyboard roller and mute button to control PC volume.
