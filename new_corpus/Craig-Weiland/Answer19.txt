Smokers smoke because they like the calming effect it has  and the flavor of it. The Oracle smokes because she feels like it. I very much doubt she worries about a cancer risk  just like I doubt the Merovingian worries about contracting an STD when he seduces random women who dine in his restaurant. They're both programs in a simulated reality  not living human beings. Even if there is a risk she might get cancer from smoking  the Oracle already knows she's not going to be around long enough to find out.
