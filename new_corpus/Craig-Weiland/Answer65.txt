  "Keeping a thought." When I want someone to know that I'm thinking well of them and hoping turns out ok for whatever it is they are stuggling with  I tell them "I'm keeping a thought for you (and your family). "This just means that every so often I remind myself that they are dealing with something difficult. Often  I will actually write it down so I don't let myself forget. That way  next time I see them  I can make sure to find out how they're doing and see if there's anything I can do to help them.Often when I find out a friend's family member has died (particularly if it's someone I don't see or talk to very often) I will append this information to their address card in my Contacts program.
