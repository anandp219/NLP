Blackberry is also very much about the security of the information moving through its channels and this has been of primary concern to them from the beginning. I would trust my Blackberry a lot sooner than I'd trust an iPhone or Android device. *Not the first technically  but the first device to combine PDA  email connectivity and telephony using secure encryption  making it the device of choice for enterprise in the early 2000s. I'd venture to say that very few people knew what a "smartphone" was before Blackberry made them commonplace in business.
