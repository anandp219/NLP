  Some excellent answers here. I have one other suggestion  which I wrote in answer to What do you do when you get tired of living?  which I will quote:Plan something.Plan something extravagant  something you've always wanted to do but never really thought you could. It can be something that may take many years to prepare for  to save up money for  to research and train for... but give yourself a goal  a realistic one  and make it a goal you really want to achieve. That will give you something you may be missing in your life: hope.Make it something that does not depend on the whims or permission of any other person.
