This is deliberately left unexplained  but I have a theory about Sati's role in the new matrix.But the most profound change in the new matrix is that it is built on an entirely new theory. In previous matrixes  every human is allowed to choose  at a subconscious level  whether to accept the matrix as reality. This choice inevitably results in a One to manifest  which would follow the path Neo took back to the Architect. However in this new matrix  the choice is offered to humankind overtly whether or not to remain plugged in or freed  and this untested approach may not result in a new One to emerge.
