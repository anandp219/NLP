  In my opinion  she smokes because this is something the writers (the Wachowskis) used to anti-stereotype her character. Before we met the Oracle  the crew of the Neb talk about her with the deepest reverence. An expectation in the audience's mind is created  that this entitywho can seem to tell the futureis powerful  wise and intimindating. Morpheus only takes Neo to see her when he's good and ready  meaning to see the Oracle is not something one does capriciously. So the audience has some expectations of... perhaps something priestlike  or maybe like a shaman  something ancient and wise and even a little scary.No.
