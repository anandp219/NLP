  No. The Architect does not exist inside the matrix. He is one of its creators  so he is not accessible from inside the creation except through the specific path Neo followed (into that specific building  through that specific door  using that specific key at that specific time). When Neo is standing in the white room conversing with the Architect  he is not in the matrix any longer. He is in the Machine mainframe. The only way Smith would have had any access to the Architect would be if he had already infected Neo before Neo went through the doorway.
