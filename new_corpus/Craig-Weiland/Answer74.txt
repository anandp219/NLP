The humans they did capture were experimented on (one supposes  in support of their Terminator endeavor)  but it was never shown that the Machines wanted to keep humans around as slaves*.That being said  the Machines choosing to enslave humanity for use as a power source is not too far removed from the Terminator universe. Machines in Terminator were merciless killers  as were the Machines in the Matrix universe (the Machines in the Wachowskis Matrix films were not at all benevolent). So it could be written that after the Machines won the war  they took the surviving humans they had been experimenting on and devised a way to create the powerplants  and then began experimenting with artificial virtual worlds to keep the humans' minds placated and docile.So while it's possible to integrate the two into a mostly coherent backstory  it could only be done with Terminator sacrificing its most defining elements  mainly the Machines fighting to extinguish the human race  the elements of time-travel  and the Terminator cyborgs themselves.As for John Conner being the first One  this is not possible.
