The One was described by Morpheus as having been born into the matrix:Morpheus: When the matrix was first built  there was a man born inside who had the ability to change whatever he wanted. To remake the matrix as he saw fit. It was he who freed the first of us. Taught us the truth.He would have to have been born within the matrix  as the One has to have the ability to move in and out of that world. John Conner was born a free human  outside of the powerplants and thus does not have the bioneural interface for connecting to the matrix and interacting with the people there.So while there are some consistencies between the two stories  the inclusion of John Conner as the first One is not realistic.
