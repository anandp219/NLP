They have a broad life perspective. Teenagers have a very  very narrow one.But you can't communicate this to most teenagers. Their needs are immediate and they cannot see past them into a possible context that isn't in their long-term interests. They are like the proverbial mouse in the maze. From their point of view  life is a series of simple choices: what turn to make next. Parents are seeing much more of the maze their children are navigating and can more effectively guide them toward positive outcomes  even if it seems contradictory to their children's short-term priorities of the moment.
