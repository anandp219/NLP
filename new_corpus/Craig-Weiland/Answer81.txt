The Portable came years before them. It's not a fair comparison.If you're comparing it to its actual contemporaries  the Portable was fast  expandable (it actually had an expansion slot! )  had a better screen  a better keyboard and a better battery. It was a desktop computer that could travel  not a laptop. Laptops in the late 80s and early 90s were barely capable of supplementing a desktop computer. They compromised display  keyboard  internal storage  I/O and many other features in favor of weight and size.
