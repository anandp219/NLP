  My keyboard volume control is one of two places where I adjust my PC's audio output. It's the first place I go. Seconding what May Leong said about not wanting to tab-out of a full-screen game experience  it's just so much easier to use the hardware controls on the keyboard than it is to interrupt my game to fiddle with Windows' volume in the Start bar. I also like that my keyboard (Corsair K95) has a mute button so if I have to take a phone call or something  I can squelch the sound without any trouble.Sometimes I'm piping music through the PC via a streaming radio station.
