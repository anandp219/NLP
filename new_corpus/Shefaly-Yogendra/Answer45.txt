  The crucial bit here is "in a startup". In that context  it is worth remembering that narrow specialisations do not come about in very early days; they emerge over time. Regardless of whether it is the choice of colours in the UI or the font size or indeed which products in a jewellery collection are actually going into production  a "creative decision" is about how a prospect or consumer interacts with the brand and its values  experiences the product  and decides ultimately whether or not to become a customer.
