A heightened sense of empathy and anticipation.One could argue a caregiver already has great empathy but the nature of empathy and anticipation can vary by context. For instance  a senior patient in hospital may have access to attendants and nurses who help with loo needs and basic monitoring while patient remains in bed. But the same patient at home will not have this support. The caregiver will have to anticipate many things which the patient might have been able to have attended on-demand earlier.
