In the absence of any detail about which degree or course  it is also difficult to assess the relevance and impact of your achievements on your application and your chances. For instance  with all my prior graduate degrees in different disciplines all excluding biology  if I wanted to apply straight away to a Master's in neurology  I would get a thumbs-down  as it is a degree in a subject that needs much prior knowledge. So it is anybody's guess what the final outcome may be. You have a stellar list of accomplishments but do be aware  they will be weighed against some of the world's best applicants  many of whom may have overcome great hardships in their not-so-wealthy (relative to Sweden) countries.
