That is when it starts getting really interesting.Once I was leaving India when a test match series between India and England was on. The passport control guy asked me  "so Madam  now that you are British by passport  whom do you support - India or England?". Cricket loyalty is a big test of one's real  deep loyalties in both countries  you see. I had to tell him the truth  "Sir  perhaps you want to consider that it is now possible for me to be shamed by not one but two teams playing badly and losing what they could have excelled at!"
