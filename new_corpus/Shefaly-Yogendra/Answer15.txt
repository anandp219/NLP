This can cause much disagreement about whose job is what  and whether there is one bread earner and one house keeper and so on. Earlier this year  I was at a dinner with some people  where a couple was also present. The wife is a staunch republican with a deep hatred of Obama not without overt racism while the husband is a democrat and supports Obama's policies. After a drink too many  the wife was loudly discussing their medical problems and bills and cost of insurance  while the husband  visibly embarrassed  was trying to tell her that as an entrepreneur in early days he would be without any insurance without Obamacare.
