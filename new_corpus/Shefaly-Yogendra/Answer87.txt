A friend of mine gave her son his own corner in the garden and once when he was 4  I heard him ask if they could get baked artichoke at dinner from his lot of vegetables! He is now 10 and very keen on things such as oysters and snails which comes from a combination of his family context  his interest and his liking for new tastes. Likewise there is some evidence that some people dislike the smell and taste of coriander and it is genetic. Yet others may find their own preferences re smells etc override their social context eg one of my Bengali friends who hates fish  its smell and its appearance  and nothing can make the near-50yo try it!
