There is much writing  but arguably none better than Viktor Frankl's on keeping optimism alive and seeking meaning in life  and how that contributes to wellness and a life greater than survival. I don't know if the OP was seeking some other kind of answer on choices the elderly make. In my observation and studying decisions  these two recur as the two most damaging things the elderly can voluntarily do to themselves.
