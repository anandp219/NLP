I wake early and read and write in the quiet of the morning. I don't like human beings to be around me or talking to me at that time. I am also a fussbudget and make my own coffee to peculiar strengths depending on my mood du jour  which might make it hard for anyone else to predict or keep track of. I would pay for people to lay off making coffee for me in the mornings  if pushed.
