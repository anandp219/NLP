  What a fascinating question! As an expat  I have often thought about the matter and tried to find people who have experienced statelessness. There are several possibilities. The country of which one is a citizen may withdraw the nationality from the person. The most recent and high profile case is Edward Snowden whose passport was revoked leaving him stateless. The country of which one is a citizen ceases to exist when one is outside it. This happened to many in 1971 when Bangladesh was formed and overnight many citizens of then-East Pakistan found themselves stateless while in other countries.
