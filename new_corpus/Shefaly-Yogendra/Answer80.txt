  I read and recommend the following writers in no particular order. I am interested in a lot of things so if you seek patterns in the following  do so at your own peril. Marie Stein on travel  honest to goodness life wisdom  risk and governance issues Nan Waldman on sympathetic advice on parenting and child psychology Cyndi Perlman Fink specialises in perspective on age and ageing. She is 17 and going strong! Tamara Wiens has taught me all I know on trans issues while for gender issues and social justice  none better to read than Emily Smith  Ara Ogle  Kat Tanaka Okopnik.
