I had written about what goes into making an informed decision about bariatric surgery: Picking the surgeonThe consulting surgeon should want to get to know you as a patient so he or she can advise you on whether surgery is the best option for you (there are lowness cutoffs for BMI at which surgery is not the option); this may lead to a revenue loss for the surgeon  but we are looking for a robust ethical compass and commitment  instead of a 10-min consultation with the cynical view that weight loss may not be permanentThe surgeon should be willing to advise you on the risks and your own commitments post-surgery for optimal weight loss The surgeon should not hesitate to advise you to get counselling or any other help you may need to be fully mentally prepared before surgeryThe surgeon should be willing to share with you his or her record of such surgeries  success rates (% weight loss  over what time  weight kept off)  failure and complication rates a(deaths  failure to lose weight etc) Where possible  client testimonials should be made available too so you can talk to past patientsThe surgeon should have a follow-up plan to check how you are doing after the surgery; such a plan may need regular discussions and meetings to see if you are coping and if you have problems resulting.
