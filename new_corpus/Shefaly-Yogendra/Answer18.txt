  Yes  and it doesn't take very long either. All it takes is falling out of practice or leaving an immersive environment. My previous housekeeper's son got to the U.K. when he was 11. As he started attending school  his English got better and better  while at home  despite Bulgarian TV etc  he stopped doing much more than listen to his mother talking. He has taken just 5 years to lose the language that was all he spoke before he got to the U.K. While German wasn't my "native" language I was fluent in it  to the extent I conducted business meetings  could watch and enjoy films  and read books in German.
