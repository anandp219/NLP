To me those are problematic questions too even if we feel we are removed from their impact. So now with the long background  to your question. There are two parts to the issue you raise -- letting a dispassionate discourse on prejudices stand so as to serve the cause of public safety  and letting Quora be a safe place for those minorities who are often stereotyped or harassed due to prejudices. I would like the former to be the focus of a knowledge community too but my observation as a very early user here (and I have seen variants of approaches trialled  adopted or discarded) is that Quora is choosing to focus on the latter (although it is far from doing a good job on PoC  LGBTQ  native Americans  disabled persons) over the former.
