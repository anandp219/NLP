  A "sacrifice" is nothing but a trade-off where one enjoys the choice one made but for various reasons  continues to regret the opportunity cost or to miss not picking the other option. I have written elsewhere on Quora that I don't feel regret for any of my past decisions because at the time  they were the choices I made. No other people were harmed in the making of those choices either.The only thing I sometimes reconsider is my choice of living in the UK many thousand miles far from my father.
