  Self care. It is easy and common for younger caregivers serving senior citizens to draw upon their greater reserves of energy and early enthusiasm to do things like long night duty  running around  researching things etc. In the absence of eating and sleeping enough  and getting enough stretches and exercise  this burst can fade swiftly. In practical terms  this means the caregiver needs to be self aware  aware of how his/ her interactions with others change with his/ her own energy and restedness  and able to anticipate that care needs are uncertain  unpredictable and fluctuating thus summoning energies one cannot always plan for.
