  I notice two things that have long term impact on the health and activity levels and the longevity of the elderly. Reducing or stopping moving: You move more  you move more. One doesn't have to be "old" to see how true this is. Being active keeps joint mobility going. That  combined with doing activity to keep balance  prevents accidental falls  which are a significant form of injury in the elderly. The fear of falling is a pretty significant fear in the elderly  rightly so. But many think the answer lies in stopping movement altogether.
