But  ultimately  "what if" scenarios are generally not healthy in that they are diversions  time wasters  and excuses not to be living in the present. Along with being nonproductive  the "what if..bad?" thoughts are a sign that that there is some belief in  "I am bad" or "I am not worthy" or "I always make the wrong choice" or "I am not as good as" or "I am never going to win the girl"  none of which are ever true  however  we hold these as unconcious beliefs  unhealed traumas from our pre-memory childhood.
