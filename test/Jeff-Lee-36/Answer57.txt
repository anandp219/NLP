  I am not sure your question  as stated  is as meaningful to others as it is to you  in that it might not necessarily make the case that you believe you want to make  which  I assume  has something to do with proving the existence or non existence of God or the supernatural. All experiences with the earth  with math  with philosophy  with your body  with your self concept  are products of the brain. Regardless of the location of the seat of conciousness  you have only one mechanism for the awareness of your thoughts.
