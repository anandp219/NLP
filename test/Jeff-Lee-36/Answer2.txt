The mere fact that you could feel guilty about it after the fact is proof that you are not aligning your behavior (or concious thoughts) with your true values. You cannot buy a stairway to heaven. If you could  it wouldn't be heaven and you wouldn't really want it. So  what are going to do about it? Can you agree that it is better to give because you love  and that sharing is a happy duty? Then  you start with giving more of yourself. And  whenever you are aware of thinking you are better than someone else  immediately admit that you failed on that day  and try again.
