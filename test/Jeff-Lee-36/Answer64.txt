How we become satisfied can take different paths for each of us because we each have different false beliefs to let go  different fears from which to be released. No one path works for everyone  but a combination of acceptance  meditation  mindfulness  empathy  love  service to others  and trust in your authentic self  are guaranteed way showers along the path.
