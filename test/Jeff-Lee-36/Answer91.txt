Relative morality  religious righteousness (still wrong-ness ) simply gives yourself permission for hate  judgment  desiring punishment or retribution  even executing that action in the legal system. It is all a neurotic attempt to project our own fears and sekf-worth issues onto others. It is all "normal" human behavior. The extreme may be more obvious in its wrongness or mental illness  but it all is less than admirable for a species that believes it is the highest state of development or one imbued with the holiness of its creator.
