  In your introductory course  you would have learned about materials with a linear response (linear homogenous isotropic dielectrics are the only things anyone deals with usually). That is  the polarisation induced is proportional to the electric field. The consequence of this is that the light scattered by such objects has the same frequency as the incident light.But in reality  material response is not linear. Many materials have a nonlinear response and the relationship between polarisation and field is more complicated.
