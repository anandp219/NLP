We happily put women on a pedestal  worshipping them and placing heaven at their feet. We treat them as precious things which should be protected  even at the cost of their freedom. The very basis of feminism that men and women are equal and deserve to be equally free goes against the foundations on which the Indian society is built. Questioning this foundation would make a lot of the structure that is built on it come crashing down.In comparison  the constitution of India treats gender equality as fundamental.
