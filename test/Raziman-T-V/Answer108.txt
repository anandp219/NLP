First  note that if two lines are parallel  only the lower one ever has any chance to be the lowest line at any point. So discard all but the lowest line out of sets of parallel lines.Next  note that in the figure  the lines which attain minimal height have monotonically decreasing slopes from left to right. This should not be surprising : A line with a higher slope can never become lower than a currently lower line by going further to the right. So we will first sort all the lines in decreasing order of slope.We will now scan this sorted list from left to right and build up the list of lowest lines and the coordinate ranges for which they are lowest.
