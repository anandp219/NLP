Toward the end of my stay  Sharon mentioned that she was going to present excerpts from one of her books after dinner. I was excited to hear her readings  but honestly was not predicting what it would be like based on getting to know her.That evening I was floored. Sharon's selections from Branch in His Hand were so intense  so wrought with beauty and sadness that I did not know how to respond to what I was hearing. Underneath the family therapist  the mother  the wife  the friend  was someone with a profound ability to express loss.
