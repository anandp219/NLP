(Clayton) Alfred Schnittke (1934-1998)  The brief  wordless Voices of Nature (1972)  for ten women's voices and vibraphone (deployed in an eleven-part canon)  is closer to the Schnittke we know in its use of Ligetian micropolyphony to produce dense and dissonant clusters. (Anderson) Sndor Balassa (1935- )  Finally  the contrast between rangy expressionist vocal melody and a dense micopolyphony in which isolable melody plays little part obviously suggests Ligeti  though Ligeti himself had not clearly adopted this technique when Balassa composed his Requiem in 1968-69.
