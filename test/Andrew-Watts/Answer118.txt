The composer is intentionally relinquishing some creative decision making  and transferring the role to the computer. In a way  this is a more modern take on generating pre-compositional material than John Cage's chance procedures. The composer is still in control of some parameters  as Lewis is writing the program and knows the possible ways that Voyager could react to input. He is also choosing the orchestral sound libraries  albeit the manner in which they are combined in textures is up to the software.
