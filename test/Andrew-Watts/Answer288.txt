At any given moment  ones attention might rapidly be shifting from the violinists playing col legno  to the pianist hammering on the strings with felt beaters  to the trombonist playing multiphonics with a double reed  to the choir stage-whispering into their microphones.This contextualizing of timbral saturation works well  as exemplified with the Cendo piece  when applied to chamber ensembles or larger groups. However  the Lachenmann  Hendrix  and Romitelli pieces are all focusing on the soloist.
