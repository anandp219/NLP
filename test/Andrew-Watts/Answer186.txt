  When it is time to really focus on my work I retreat from the outside world and make my desk space a sanctuary. I like Ellen's imagery of fences blocking out the zombie hordes  however  I always imagined myself like a medieval monk cloistered away in his cell. No distractions  just the manuscript in front of me and the abbey walls surrounding me.Unfortunately  this mindset does not encourage a daily routine amidst the busyness of modern life. For as much as I would like to sit down and create a little every day  I need substantial time to get into the right head space.
