Despite the composer partitioning of the work into sections  the approach to each is unified in  as Mason expresses  [its] ability to move between systems within 72tet: traditional 12-tone equal temperament  24-tone equal temperament (quarter tones)  and the pitches of the harmonic series up to the 12th partial are all subsets of 72tet. The same integration between sections cannot be said about the three Ives pieces. The first two pieces share more in common with the solo piano literature of the 18th and 19th centuries than the 20th and 21st.
