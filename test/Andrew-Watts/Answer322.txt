Composer Jonathan Harvey took the bells harmonic spectrum and examined it with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) program at IRCAM. The influence of the specific technology used  especially during these early days of computer music analysis  should not be overlooked. In this case Harvey  with the technical assistance of Stanley Haynes  realized the synthetic bell modulations and transformations on IRCAMs version of MusicV (originally created by Max Mathews in 1969).The second sound source  that of the choristers Latin singing  was then also synthesized from a live recording; however  this time using the program CHANT developed by Gerald Bennett and Xavier Rodet.
