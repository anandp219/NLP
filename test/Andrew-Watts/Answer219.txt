Why compose for the individual (micro) when you can more directly achieve arguably the same ensemble sound (macro)?The often exacting rhythms and difficult harmonies practically invite slip-ups within even the most seasoned groups performing Lux Aeterna. The paradoxical part is that these small inaccuracies that accompany live performance make little to no difference in the perceived effect of the sound masses due to the density and chromatic saturation of the texture. Perfect  machine-like intonation would be no better (and perhaps  ironically  much worse) at creating the desired effect.
