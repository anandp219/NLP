  I am by no means a choral conductor  though I have studied quite a bit of choral music and sang in choruses at various points of my academic career. To be honest  I would not know where to begin regarding which score recommendations have the most practical or pedagogical value to a conductor. Instead I will take the approach of a historical survey. Below is my curated list of works I have found noteworthy in outlining the choral tradition through Western classical music. I suspect obtaining the scores to many of these would provide a solid personal reference library for any choral conductor.
