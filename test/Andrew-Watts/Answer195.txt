Often I will catch a cold the week after I finish. My body and mind have been in such a state of prolonged stress that when I am ready to relax and let my guard down my immune system takes a break too. Thinking really hard about something for such a long time does require time afterwards to reset and readjust to "normal" life for me. With that being said  I would not trade it in for anything. Getting to witness wild abstractions come to life time and time again is the greatest feeling in the world.
