In a way  I'm being evasive by using tonal textures. I didn't want to present a context in which one not only had to parse a complicated timbral texture and a complicated rhythmic texture  but also a complicated pitch texture. [ For Idle Chatter] I had lots of voices going all over the place  chattering right and left. To make any sense of it  I found I had to simplify the pitch structure. When I was working on it I started out using fairly complicated pitch structures  and found that the listening experience proved to be utterly exhausting.
