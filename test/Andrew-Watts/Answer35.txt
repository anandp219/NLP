Silky smooth  medium bodied  with a very firm consistency and slightly chewy back. Hop presence is artfully chaotic. Nice prickly stab on the palate up front  semisharp bitterness  grassy  zesty grapefruit  deep smacking of ripe pineapple and pine. Juicy fruitiness  notes of apple and pear too. Dry middle with suggestions of chalky aspirin. Bready malts  soft and sweet  provide a nice backboard for the hops. Oily and ashy hop resins stick to the palate and follow through into a dry  bitter linger.
