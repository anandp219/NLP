The composer describes the microtonal functionality here as [a] cantus firmus  taken by the upper voice in the coda [...] made of a phrase in quarter-tones going to one in half-tones and ending in whole tones  while the harmonic plan remains throughout on a quarter-tone basis. Though it is not stated if the cantus firmus is original or not  many of his compositions draw upon quotations  in particular hymns (i.e. Three Places in New England). Haas' piano writing at the end of Limited Approximations also functions akin to a chorale  albeit perceptually stretched and intervalically compressed to an extreme.
