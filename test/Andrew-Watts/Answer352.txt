The resulting textures produced by the campi sonori are  as one might imagine  densely saturated walls of sound covering the quarter-tone steps within a larger interval. The immediate historic comparison would be to the sound-clouds of Iannis Xenakis (ex. Pithoprakta  1956)  micropolyphony of Gyorgy Ligeti (ex. Apparitions  1958-1959)  and the tone clusters of Krzysztof Penderecki (ex. Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima  1960). Though all of these works are precursors  it is unclear how much their concepts influenced Nono's writing in Canti di vita e d'amore.
