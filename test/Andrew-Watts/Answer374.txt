John Irvine writes of this method in the article Luigi Nonos Canti di vita e damore: New Phases of Development 1960-62:[...] One can also sense Nono looking back on his Venetian heritage by  firstly  taking on the spatiomusical innovations of the Gabrielis (the placement of sounds in a particular space or acoustic) and secondly  that inspired by the highly chromatic music of Gesualdo (microtonal movement within the sounds themselves). It seems as if everything Nono does in his creative life takes Venice  and particularly the Giudecca  his home  as the chief poetic point of departure [...]Instruments are laid out on the score in groups of twelve which obviously facilitates Nono's desire to position all twelve tones  and their twelve intervening microtones  in some form of stratification across the instrumental sections.
