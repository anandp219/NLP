  Marissa Mayer doesn't and shouldn't have to set a good example. But to the extent that she inadvertently does  she actually sets a wonderful example for women by choosing to take only limited leave. She sends a message that not all women are the same  and that babies aren't just the women's responsibility.Different Input  Different OutputSee  the thing with a choice like how much leave to take: it's a personal choice that every mother needs to make for herself. A mother's choice will take into account things like:her careerher financial situationher partner's careerher desire to care for newbornsher ability to hire or get helpher partner's parental leave breastfeeding decisionsher healthher baby's healthother children at homeTo impose one person's decision on another person's  when any or all of these factors are different  is not just unfair; it's illogical.
