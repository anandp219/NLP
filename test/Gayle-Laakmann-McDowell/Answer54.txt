  That's an interesting question.First  I'm not so sure that it's true that most adults are unvaccinated. Vaccination isn't a binary thing. An adult might have some shots but not all. By contrast  a kid whose parents won't vaccinate on principle are likely to have no vaccinations. The adult  therefore  is a bit less of a risk.Second  even if most adults overall are behind on shots  that doesn't mean the adults you know are that behind. The adults I know tend to be well-educated and have good access to healthcare.
