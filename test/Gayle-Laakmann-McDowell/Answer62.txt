Additionally  given your age  there could be other factors at play. Perhaps you say you don't care about your appearance because you think it's hopeless. Or perhaps you think it takes too much effort. Or perhaps you don't want to enter into competition with your sisters. Or perhaps you want to feel superior over others and call them superficial.As I said  there's a lot of value in knowing how to put yourself together well. I would encourage you to find a way that works for you. Perhaps drop the sweatpants for stretchy skinny jeans (which can be much more comfortable  surprisingly  than normal jeans).
