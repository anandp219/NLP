Being different makes kids feel vulnerable. Not just feel vulnerable  but be vulnerable. They're often isolated from their peers and scared of their friends and family finding out their secret. Child abusers are sickly drawn to this sort of vulnerability. If gay people are more likely to have been abused at a younger age  the causal direction is very likely the other way around.
