Let it build (or collapse) authentically.That doesnt mean you cant seek out mentorships. You can  just like you can friendships. Theyre not all that different. Both are fundamentally personal relationships  even if one is forged over drinks and gossip and another over coffee and advice.To establish a mentorship: Make yourself not a stranger. I recognize the names of people who regularly comment on my Quora posts  who re-share my Facebook posts  and who re-tweet my tweets. If I feel like youre not just a total stranger  Im more likely to help you.Write well.
