And that choice is okay.I'm pregnant  self-employed and have several consulting clients right now. They assume that I'm not really going to be working for a while after I have my child. Of course they don't ask -- it's often seen as a no-no topic in the US -- so there's just this lingering assumption until I awkwardly bring it up. And that sucks  frankly.By Marissa Mayer taking limited leave  she helps clear the way for people like me who choose to make a similar choice. She makes my clients question their assumption that of course I'll take months off.
