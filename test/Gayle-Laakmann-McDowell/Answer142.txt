Ill feel a bit indebted to you  Im more likely to help you. In fact  if I even see signs that youre generally a nice and helpful person to other people  Im more likely to help you. I prefer to help nice people.If I know you (even a little)  if I feel like youre trying to help yourself  if I feel youre a nice person  and especially if I feel a little obligated  Im a lot more likely to chat with you  especially if you make it really easy for me. We can see where things go from there. We dont need to establish terms and conditions  so please dont ask me to be your mentor.
