Your vaccinated child also poses a health risk to the not-fully-vaccinated child  more so than your child does to the not-fully-vaccinated adult. Many people dismiss this under the rationale that they chose to not get vaccinated. But remember: the parent chose that  not the child. And even unvaccinated adults don't deserve to die.That said  although the unvaccinated child is more risky than the unvaccinated adult  I suspect there's a good amount of "we blame because we can." A parent who doesn't vaccinate their child (other than for rare medical reasons) is willfully introducing a health risk to their child and other children  without their consent.
