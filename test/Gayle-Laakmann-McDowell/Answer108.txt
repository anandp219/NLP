  He should regret it. He should not have rescinded the offer publicly. In fact  nearly every part of this was wrong: objecting so strongly to the candidate's actions  actually rescinding the offer  and doing so publicly.1. He should not have rescinded the offer publicly.This is a private matter between the company and the candidate. It's not okay to disclose this publicly.2. He should not have actually rescinded the offer  when he could have just politely discouraged the candidate from joining.Instead of actually rescinding the offer  he could have gotten on the phone with the candidate and said something like this:I saw your post and you're still welcome here.
