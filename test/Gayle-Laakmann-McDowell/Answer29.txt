What's so funny (to them)? That she's transgender. That's what people are  in most or all cases  making fun of when they dress as her. Making fun of someone who is transgender for being transgender is offensive and hurtful to many people. And from the looks of it  the people who are selling the costume know this. They picked a man to wear the costume -- and a particularly "macho" man. HILARIOUS  right?That's not to say that a custom of a transgender celebrity couldn't exist respectfully -- or even non-offensively but still not "respectful".
