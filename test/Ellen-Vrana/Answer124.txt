As a result  I hated  I mean HATED the two main characters. Then I reread it. I don't think it is their fault. Nick and Amy - not their fault they were so erratic. Amy was driven to kill because her author needed her to. There was no other way to show her complete downfall and make us not see her as a victim. I maintain that there was not nearly enough compelling information that she would have been so maniacal or masochistic OR that she wouldn't have just killed her parents. Same goes for Nick  he was wholy inconsistent and unbelievable.
