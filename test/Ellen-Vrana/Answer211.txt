Tell me things. Show me the darkest parts of themselves. Everyone opens up to me. It took me a while to realize  THESE are their monsters! Just  more tame than mine. But it really isn't that different. All humans have depths and darkness.Next step  show them yours. I'm not there yet. Maybe we can work on this together? In the meantime  I'll start calling it my Polar Bear  maybe that will remove some stigma. No more monster.
