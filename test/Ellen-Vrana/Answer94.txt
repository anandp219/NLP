OTHER NARRATION OPTIONS2nd person - rarely used  is when a character is talking to about himself. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Se...Omniscient (removed) - Ok  I made this up. But I take it to mean when a narrator is removed from everyone's head  the reader only knows what people think through actions. So there is no narrator (save Shakespeare's Chorus)  and you might as well write a drama/play.This answer was how I think about POV in fiction writing  here are some other views (hehe):- Self-Editing for Fiction Writers  a great book written by editors  not authors.
