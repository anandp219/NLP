Are you really helping them the way they need it? Are you doing what they'd want? Or are you doing what you'd want?And finally  if you have friends taking advantage of you and your generous nature  then reduce your expectations of them. It will be hard and sad  but you have to tell yourself that this person isn't what you thought  and just won't be there for you. And find others who will do better.
