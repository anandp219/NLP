  Not much. The waiter won't starve  you won't be rich.I disagree with answers that say this is about money and impoverished waiters. When individuals choose to be waiters  they accept the relationship between income and service levels.But there is a bigger issue that should compel you to tip. There is a social contract that connects Americans. We abide by it in order to enjoy the privileges our society offers.This social contact includes  among other things;- Not cutting in line (and respecting a line in the first place) - Not letting your dog shit on someone's property - Not shouting in libraries or churches - Not disrespecting or defacing a U.S. flag - Not urinating in public - Not "accidentally" touching women - AND tipping waiters.
