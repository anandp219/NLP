Parts of it I'm using in my cells  parts of it I left behind. It doesn't exist as a burger.Same with failures. They don't stick with me as things because that means I haven't broken them down and used them. Say I lost $1M. If I keep talking about having lost $1M and fixate on that (which on it's own means nothing) rather than all the events that lead up to it and past it.. . I'm stuck. I don't grow.Failure is an inflection point  not a badge.You have to step off the inflection point and move on.
