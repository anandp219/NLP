  I'm really good at small talk.Weather. Travel. Food. Downton Abbey. See? Look how interesting I am. Except  I'm not. Well  I am - but you wouldn't know from small talk. You can't make yourself interesting in small talk. The nature of small talk is to be UNINTERESTING. Generic. Innocuous. It's the method humans have settled on in polite society to create bonds without offending anyone or being vulnerable.I'm good at small talk because I LOATHE it. And thus  I don't let it remain small. If you want to be interesting  learn to do this too.
