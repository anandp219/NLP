How? MAKE SMALL TALK INTO BIG TALK  i.e. MEANINGFUL1. Ask an easy lead question.Where are you from? I love this one because there is so much great conversation that can come from it.Others might be;Is this your first . . . (if you meet at an event).Something topical that you'd both know about given your circumstances (a speech  a person  weather  a meal).Or I sometimes comment on someone's name or outfit - whatever I find interesting.2. Ask a follow-up question. You asked; Where are you from? They tell you.
