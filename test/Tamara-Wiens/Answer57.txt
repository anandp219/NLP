Transition opened my eyes in an incredible way  from simple things like my opinion being less important or even correct  to scary things like never running alone after dark anymore  to complicated things like how the behaviour that men say that they want from women that they date isn't actually what they want.My experience isn't isolated. Other trans women report the same outcomes and trans men report the opposite - where they used to be ignored and seen as bitchy with an awkward sense of humour  they suddenly  without changing anything but gender  had opinions that mattered  were seen as assertive when they were forceful  and had even their weakest jokes at least treated as an attempt to be funny instead of just embarrassing.
