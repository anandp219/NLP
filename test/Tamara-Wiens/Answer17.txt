One of the challenges faced by trans  homosexual and heterosexual people in understanding gender and orientation is that the vast majority (70% or more) of the world population identify as straight cis people. This means that there is a strong correlation between gender assigned at birth  gender identity  gender presentation  and orientation - men are identified male at birth  continue to identify as male  do masculine things and wear masculine clothes and are attracted to women  while women are identified female at birth  continue to identify as female  do feminine things and wear feminine clothes and are attracted to men.The problem is that this view  called the "gender binary"  is very narrow  and very  very incomplete.
