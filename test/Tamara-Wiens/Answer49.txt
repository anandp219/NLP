  The motivation for me doesn't change at all. Credits were cute markers signifying reach and popularity but that never incented or disincented me from answering. The thing about the sharing economy  epitomized by sites like Quora  Wikipedia and Instagram  projects like the Linux core or Apache  or even crowd funding  is that the participants are motivated by things other than profit. These can include a bunch of reasons  such as notoriety  social group acceptance and status  supporting a worthy cause or simply adding to human knowledge in some small way.
