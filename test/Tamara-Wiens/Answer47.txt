  So far it appears to be none. This lack of diversity has been pointed out by Top Writers and other users both publicly as questions on Quora and posts in the Facebook support groups  and in PMs to the relevant people - no substantive answer has ever been forthcoming. The reality is that there are no visible PoCs or LGBT or other minority representation within Quora. There is only one visible full-time staff member who is a woman (Tatiana Estevez - I believe that Alecia Morgan is either part time or contract)  and she is in the 4th level of the hierarchy.
