Credits  which were always pretty useless anyway  could be part of that as status markers.My personal motivation has always been the opportunity to add something to the store of human knowledge by contributing my unique experiences and perspective. I suspect that this is likely the motivation for many people. I am doubtful that credit count could be a motivation that generates quality responsive answers.
