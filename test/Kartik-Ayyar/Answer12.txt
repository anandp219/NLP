The horse mackerel and eel feel into this category.Was the egg as good as it was hyped up to be?Absolutely. It was unlike any other Tamago I've eaten at a sushi restaurant. Unlike most other sushi restaurants  it's more of a cake than a gross looking chunk out of an omelette. This was one of the courses that definitely made Jiro stand out from the Tsujiki sushi restaurants.Would I do it again ?Given that I don't live there  I'd happily include it in a visit to Tokyo given how infrequent I'd expect those to be  If I were a local  I'd probably visit it at most once a year for a special occasion.
