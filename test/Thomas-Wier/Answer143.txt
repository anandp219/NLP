  The short answer is that Georgian and Ossetian belong to totally unrelated language families  use largely unrelated lexicons  and have rather dissimilar grammatical systems.One of the big problems that students of Caucasian languages face is what you might call the Orientalist Fallacy: speakers of Caucasian languages 'over there' have been living next to each other  speaking each other's languages for centuries or millennia  so they must be pretty similar  right? Georgians and Ossetians share many traits in common: marriage customs  culinary traditions  modes of dress  styles of architecture  rules of hospitality (and contrariwise  blood vendettas)  and all sorts of other cultural habits  so it is very easy to assume their languages must go along for the ride.
