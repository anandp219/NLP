After that  the largest source in the sample was Greek  which provided not only religious and cultural terms like  ek'lesia (church) and  eteri (ether) but also very many Georgian personal names like  Erek'le (Heracles)   Tornik'e (Tornikios)  and  Giorgi (George). (Sometimes of course the line between 'international words' and 'Greek/Latin words' is not always obvious  and has more to do with the context of borrowing than anything else.) Another large source of loanwords are Persian  Turkish  Arabic and Armenian words  but in these cases (due to the lack of available materials) it is not always easy to determine if a given word that is obviously not western comes from specifically one of these three languages  since many words of Middle Eastern origin were spread through all of these languages.
