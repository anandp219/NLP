They are rather unusual simply because they are systematic  not because the processes themselves are odd. Even some of the counterintuitive systems  like French and Sinhala disfixation  which subtract parts of the stem to form a plural  are not really so rare either.Maybe a better way to think about exotica in pluralization is not the formation of plurals  but the target of plurals -- which words get pluralized. In this sense  the oddest plural I've ever come across is surely the Kiowa inverse number system.
