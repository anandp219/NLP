Most languages have no gender at all  but even for those that do  having gender in pronouns is just one option. Here e.g. is a WALS map of languages with gender in pronouns:As you can see  most languages in East Asia  North America  South America and some parts of Africa lack gender distinctions in pronouns. This is a case where the fact that European languages are so widely used fools us into thinking that they are the norm  when in fact they are not.
