But after writing  as the process of copying the dispositions of signs on a tablet was introduced  Near Eastern art became linear and thus could tell a story. [When Writing Met Art]All this is missing in the Gbekli Tepe pictographs. There are clearly pictures of vultures  scorpions and other entities  but these do not constitute writing  at any level  because they merely evoke a narrative that involves vultures and scorpions and do not actually tell what role those vultures and scorpions had. No one doubts that the people who built Gbekli Tepe were anatomically and behaviorally modern (see Behavioral modernity) but writing requires more than that.
