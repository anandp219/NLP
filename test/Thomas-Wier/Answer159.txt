English  for example  allows null-conversion (i.e. change of part of speech without overt affixation) surprisingly freely:Even in English  such cases can usually be explained by mere homophony  since these cases are the exception rather than the rule. Other languages are far less clear however. English divides nouns  verbs and adjectives into fairly clear classes  but very many languages treat all adjectives as either nouns or verbs syntactically. For example in Mohawk  all adjectives inflect for person  number  tense and gender just like regular verbs:(1) a. ka-hutsi (Baker 1996) NsS-black 'It is black' b. t-a'-ka-ya't-v'-ne' CIS-FACT-NsS-body-fall-PUNC 'It fell' In this language  using an inflected verb is the only way to indicate that something is black -- there is no independent class of adjectives.
