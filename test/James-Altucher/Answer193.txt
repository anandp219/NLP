I know most of the ideas are bad ideas so I theres no sense keeping them around.If one of the ideas is good then I will probably remember it and build on it for the next day. Sometimes its kind of funny when I come across an old list of ideas to see what I was thinking. Every now and then I think I find a good idea in my old lists but its rare.And then what do I do with that rare good idea? Probably nothing.L) ARE ALL OF YOUR IDEAS BUSINESS IDEAS?No. Almost never. Its hard to come up with over 3000 business ideas a year.
