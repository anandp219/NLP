Some people say you have to read a lot. This is partly true. But if I had to research everything  then why not just hand people a reading list of what you researched. Then you don't have to write a book. You can write a paragraph about why you used each book and knit that altogether into a theory. You do have to experience a lot. But don't be fooled. There's two ways to have drama. One is: you can have it in your life. Which is often painful. I don't want to go to a war just so I can write about it.
