10 habits. 10 meta-habits. I've written about some of these before. Who can resist writing about life-hacks involving $2 bills. But I will be more concise and not always explain the reasoning. Just trust me that they work. If you've seen these before  please skip. I don't want to bore you. If you haven't seen them before  you can figure out why these life-hacks work. Put them in the comments and I'll respond. LIFEHACKS1. Carry $2 bills with you everywhere. Tip with them. Nobody forgets a person who tips with $2 bills.
