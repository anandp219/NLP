At some point I had to make a decision - am I a bad guy or a good guy?I was afraid I was a bad guy. Confirmed later when I couldn't support my family. Or when I started to hide from my friends. Because I was in a prison of shame  more and more bad things happened to me. Now I don't know. Now it doesn't matter. I like to sit down and do nothing. That's my (almost) favorite activity in the world. Sometimes Claudia is sitting there with me also. I don't mind that. I like to be with my kids. 70% of the time it's because I love them.
