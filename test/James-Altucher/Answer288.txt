I want to know. What did you do? - SOCIAL INCOMPETENCEI try to learn how to small talk. But I'm not good at it. This is not a bad or good thing. I want to get better. But sometimes at a party with everyone laughing and having gun I feel alone and isolated. I try to figure my way out of that feeling of isolation. How can I have fun also? ---All of these things brings me back to those moments  both good and bad  when I was a kid. I practice being a kid. A kid laughs 300 times. An adult  on average...five.
