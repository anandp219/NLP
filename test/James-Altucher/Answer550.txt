What if we spoke one half of that? Whenever I write a book I try to go on a silent retreat. Not to get rid of distractions. To get rid of me! When you speak  you spill your energy everywhere. It disperses into the sky. Into nothingness. Here's a good trick to try: When someone is talking to you  if you are already thinking of a response while they are still talking  then you aren't listening. Let them finish. They have something to say to you. ----There's other skills of course: sales  languages  building things...I don't know.
