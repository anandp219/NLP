  Many people make a "to do" list. I used to make that list also. And it felt great. I'd make the "to-do" list and then every time I did something on the list I'd cross it off and felt a sense of accomplishment. Woo-hooo! I called five people by 11am! Accomplishment releases all of these chemicals in the brain that then make you feel better. Very addictive chemicals. Dopamine  Endorphines  blah blah. So I'd put more things on the to-do list. More people to call. More things to write. More places to go or people to meet.
