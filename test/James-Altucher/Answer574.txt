I just hit the down button and never spoke to her again.But I also have had a few successes. Do I wish I had known these sooner? I don't know. I don't have a window into alternate realities. But I hope maybe other people's futures can be helped. HERE IS WHAT FAILURES DO:1) THEY BELIEVE IN THE WORD 'FAILURE'We dont live long enough to fail. Like if a planet is around for 4 billion years and produces no life-forms  I would call that planet a failure.Everything else is an experiment.Thomas Edison never said  I failed 10 000 times before I made a lightbulb.
