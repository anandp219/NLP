"Guess which company had the original patent that ultimately Larry Page derived his own patent (that created google) from?Go ahead. Think a second. Guess. An employee of this company created the patent and tried to get them to use it to catalog information on the web. They refused.

And Larry Page modified the patent  filed his own  and created Google.
