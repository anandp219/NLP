I called the other board members. They hadn't even looked at the financials. I called the CEO. He said  "but we have six months!" This is really really important: if you have six months  IT IS ALREADY SIX MONTHS FROM NOW. What that means is: no matter what you do: you will not be able to raise the money  do the legal  find the customers  do the work  get paid  or whatever you need to do - in six months time. You are the walking dead and you don't know it. Here's what we did. I called an emergency board meeting.
