Every atom in my body existed during the Big Bang 14 billion years ago. They made it this far. They don't need me to make a certain number. They will all be around one trillion years from now. Dear Atoms On My Body  will you even remember me? Answer: Probably not. We don't even have memories. One time I was going broke a few years ago. Again. It would have been maybe my fifth time living out of a garbage bag. I hit my chest and said  "Abundance!" and then within months an investment I made came through and I made money.
