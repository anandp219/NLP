You have food and shelter. But if you have kids and a wife and a mortgage  etc (the other extreme) don't go broke and start a business. When I started my first business  I stayed at my full time job for 18 MONTHS before I left to become CEO of my startup full-time. We had 12 employees by then and almost as many clients. In other words  I knew I could replace my salary and still pay my employees for at least six months even if everything went down hill. Which leads me to....B) IF YOU ONLY HAVE MONEY TO LAST YOU SIX MONTHS THEN YOU ARE ALREADY OUT OF BUSINESSI was on the board of a company once and when I read the monthly financials I realized the burn (the monthly loss in cash) was such that we would run out of money in six months.
