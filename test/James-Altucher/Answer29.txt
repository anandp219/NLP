Oh. My. God  Lynne said. This is really it.Its been a decade and a lot has happened  good and bad (mostly good). Someone on quora yesterday asked the question  whats it feel like to be rich? I figured Id answer based on my pre-2000 experiences. Ill save 2000-2010 for another time.A lot of people started answering the quora question with I was able to buy this  or that  or this and that. Money was never about that for me  then or now. Theres never been anything I wanted to buy (other than the next ipad!)
