Countless studies have shown this.Often its related to our mindset. To the choices we make. Again  when someone asked me why not worry about tomorrow  there is no real answer. Why should I?Francis quote: This is the struggle of every person: be free or be a slave.Even if you are stuck at the bottom of solitary confinement in jail  you can still choose to be free inside your spirit.This is not self-help BS. This is your choice: do you be miserable or do you root yourself in your inner freedom? Why choose to be miserable?And yet  often when I wake up in the morning  all my past memories suck me in as quickly as possible and its an effort not to say ugh.Then I'm a slave again.
