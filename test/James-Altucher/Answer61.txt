Through most of the 90s (the markets went straight up). 1999  the Nasdaq 100 went up almost 100% over the next year (and value stocks continued to go higher ever after the crash).From 2002-2007 the Fed raised rates every change it could get. The market went constantly up.And none of that was from such a low base of 0.25%.So newspapers  PLEASE STOP LYINGC) IS THIS LIKE 2009?In March  2009  the market hit an all-time low.Fortunately  I ended it and saved the world. No kidding.I lived at 40 Broad Street  directly across from the New York Stock Exchange.On March 9 I went out and bought 100s of Hershey's chocolate bars.
