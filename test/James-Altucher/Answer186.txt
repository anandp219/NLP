I dont have to plan my whole way through medical school.Wait!? Did I just say I would be a brain surgeon without a medical degree? No. I simply had a bad idea and the first step I would take if I was going to execute on that idea. And  yes  Im absolutely confident I would be able to do successful brain surgery before someone throws me in jail (hence  the bad idea aspect of it).A real life example: In 2006 I had ten ideas for websites I wanted to build. I knew how to program but didnt want to. So my first step was to find a site like Elance and then put the spec up and find programmers in India who could make the websites for me.
