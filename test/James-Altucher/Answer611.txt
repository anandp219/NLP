I thought that was a horrible idea  and told him so.But two things about audiobooks:He said  When people see you have an audiobook  they see your book as even more credible. It stands out from the average self-published book when you have an ebook  a print version  and an audiobook. Plus  the audio book is more expensive  so even though there are fewer sales  its decent money. By the way  if you self-publish  always do a print book at the very least. Even if 99% of your sales are going to be ebook.I asked the head of an ad agency what marketing tips he had for for my upcoming book.
