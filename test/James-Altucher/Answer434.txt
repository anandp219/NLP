It's neither good or bad. It was my one thing: Vine by James AltucherWhat happens when you only have one thing on your "to-do" list?More emails don't get answered. Most phone calls don't get returned. People think you're a jerk. I don't know. Lots of bad things happen. Things slip through the cracks. And where do they go? I have no idea. Garbage. People get disappointed. That's ok. They're all going to die. They won't say on their death bed  "everything would've been better if James just returned my call."
