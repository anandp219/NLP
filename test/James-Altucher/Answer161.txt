Ok  thats the basic idea. My rule of thumb is to always invest behind people who are smarter than me. Warren Buffett is smarter than me. One anecdote from the meeting. Someone asked Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett what was going to happen to the US dollar. Munger  who barely spoke the entire meeting  said  "you better start burying all your valuables in your back y-And thats when Buffett interrupted him with a stern  Charlie!" I dont know whats going to happen to the US dollar. Or any of these stocks.
