  Me.Here is one quick story of many...I gave my 11 year old daughter important advice the other day: theres no painless way to kill yourself.What about with a gun? she said.I told her about a friend of mine who shot himself in the mouth. He put the gun in his mouth and pointed upwards towards the brain.He missed.He shot off half his face  he went blind in one eye  and he is now in a wheelchair.If you type in "I Want to Die" into google  my website is the first result.My first business I sold for $15 million.
