------If you ask an economist what's driven economic growth  it's been major advances in things that mattered - the mechanization of farming  mass manufacturing  things like that. The problem is  our society is not organized around doing that.Google is now making advances in driverless cars  delivery drones  and other methods of automation. Everyone gets worried that this will cost jobs. But just look at history. Cars didn't ruin the horse industry. Everyone simply adjusted. TV didn't replace books.
