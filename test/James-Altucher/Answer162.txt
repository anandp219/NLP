Or my relationship with my wife. Or my relationships with my kids. One time a doctor told me we all have cancer cells  we just dont see them all the time. Ok  all of this is good to know. But I do think Buffett knows more about all of this than I do.And if I filter his knowledge with the basic fact that its good for companies to pay me cash every day  and if I filter that with demographic trends  and if I throw in an added filter that these companies have been raising their dividends for years  and on top of that I say  am I diversified  then I know that I will build an ok portfolio.
