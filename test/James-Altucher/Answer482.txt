But not THE best. I used to tape word lists to my kid's stroller when she was born. At night she couldn't sleep unless I was running full speed with the stroller. But that's ok  I was memorizing stems. But now let's cut the 1000 hours even more. If you combine two areas of interest then you don't even need 1000 hours. Let's say I'm interested in computer programming and the stock market. I can learn basic programming. I can learn the basics of the stock market. And then I can program patterns in the stock market ("What happens if the market falls 5 days in a row") and if I program a few hundred patterns I can see if any results happen that are statistically significant.
