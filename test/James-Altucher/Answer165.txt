My life insurance policy was like a gun to my head: Come up with good ideas OR ELSE your kids get your life insurance!At an airport when I realized a business I had been working on for four years was worthless.Or when I was sitting in the dark at three in the morning in the living room of the house I was going bankrupt and losing my home  my brain figuring out how to die without anyone knowing it was planned.Or when I was getting a divorce and I was lonely and afraid I wouldnt make any money again or I wouldnt meet anyone again.
