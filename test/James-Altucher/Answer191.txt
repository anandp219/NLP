Everyone I spoke to say  thats a great idea! I had already raised money and was raising more.Then  on the day I was going to close the fundraising round I woke up shaking. I had this vision of myself a year from now explaining to all of the investors why it wasnt going to work. I returned all the money. I was out the money I had spent to create the website.I can guess why it was a bad idea (people on dating sites want to be anonymous  for instance) but I didnt really know. I just knew I had to return the money.When your idea muscle is developed and the other legs of the daily practice are fully developed (Phyiscal  Emotional  Spiritual) youll have a better idea when you should shut things down.
