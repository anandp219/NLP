The more ideas I wrote  the better I got at it. It's like practice. Spiritual: I once met Thich Naht Hanh  the Buddhist monk who has been an anti-war protester since the 60s. He has seen so much sorrow. And so much pain. And yet he was smiling. Then he did a calligraphy in front of me. He drew a circle. And he spelled out the word: "smile". Spirituality is not about prayer or a god or a hope or a wish or meditation ("mad attention"). It's about: can you smile right now? If the answer is "yes"  then you are practicing being spiritual.
