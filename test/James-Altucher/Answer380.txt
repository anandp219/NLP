Everything else is an experiment. I have started 20 businesses. But in the worst case  at best it was an experiment that didnt go right. People say  only focus on the Now and yet they dont know what that means. Focus on your past also. And really take a look. When I went to graduate school and was thrown out  did I fail? Perhaps in some versions of the English language. But I view it that I experimented going to graduate school (or raising $30 million for my second business) and the experiment didnt work out.
