I doodled all the time. I drew every day. Adults say  "I can't draw." Of course you can! Here's a crayon. Go! I bought a box of crayons (16 colors) the other day. I just doodled. I colored things in. Some of the colors went outside the lines. Just practice staying kid-like. Draw a face. I drew my wife. It looked nothing like her. So I turned her into a monster. It still looked nothing like her. So I ripped up the drawing and started again. Like a kid. - MOVEMENTWhen I was a kid I'd get home and jump on the bike (no helmet) and drove everywhere I could.
