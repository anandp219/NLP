CBI has a yield of 0.40%. WMT (Wal-mart) Buffett added also to his position in Wal-mart  the biggest store in the world. Im on vacation in South Florida right now. I feel like theres a Wal-mart every mile. WMT yields 2.5% and has raised their dividend for at least the last ten years straight. PSX (Phillips 66) - again if you believe  as I do (and Warren Buffett does) that the US is going to be a bigger exporter of oil than Saudi Arabia than the marketing and refining of that oil is key. Buffett added to his PSX position  which has been raising dividends since 2002 and now yields over 2.3%.
