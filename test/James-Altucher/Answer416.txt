To me  thats what physics is. Since the rules are constantly changing  which is another fascinating aspect of physics. 4. The first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.I wonder about this. What's impossible? Maybe a time machine is too hard to figure out. But to make an electric car you can imagine first a hybrid car that has a trunk filled with very efficient batteries so you don't ever need the gas part. Then it becomes a function of probabilities versus possibilities.
