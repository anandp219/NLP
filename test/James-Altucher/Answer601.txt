Dont be afraid to say things about either yourself or your industry. Provide unique perspective.If it doesnt bleed it doesnt lead. Make sure every post or video you do bleeds from the heart  entertains  and educates. In that order.How do you get traffic? Blog on bigger sites that aggregate bloggers or podcasts or whatever. It takes time to build up. But sincere voices will always rise to the top.3) Write. This is not a post about writing or how to write a good book. The assumption is that you will write a good book.
