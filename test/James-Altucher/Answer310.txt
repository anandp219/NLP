That zero equals death. I couldnt believe how stupid I had been.I lost all my friends. Nobody returned calls. I would go to the ATM machine  from $15 million to $143 left.There were no jobs  There was nothing.One weekend when I had $0 left in my bank account I called my parents to borrow money but they said no. College was enough they told me  even though I had ended up paying for every dime of college. That was the last time I spoke to my dad  who had a stroke six months later.I tried meditation to calm down but it didnt work.
