Bad stuff builds up in the body. You have the usual disgusting methods to get out bad toxins that go into the digestion system. But what about bad stuff that builds up in every pore of your body. You have to sweat it out. Sometimes just 100 pushups a day will do it. For me  I like doing yoga.B) I dont have a lot of friends. But I do know enough people that I can do this: every day I make sure I dont talk to people who bring me down. And I try to meet new people who bring me up. I wont do business with anyone who brings me down.
