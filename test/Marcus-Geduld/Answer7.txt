  In my country (and in many other countries)  no one is locked into marriage. People (a) choose to get married  and (b) choose to stay married. For an American (German  Swede  etc) to claim he's locked into marriage is a shocking refusal to take responsibility. It's like me claiming I'm forced to work at my high-stress  corporate job. No  I'm not. I am "forced" to work there if I want to have an apartment in New York City and a huge TV. Also  Nature doesn't "advice" us to flirt around. Nature isn't sentient.
