It will start to look disgusting to you. If it's a real (non-rotten) apple  and your best friend gave it to you  it will look better to you (and probably taste better) than an identical apple from the store. Many owners of a Picasso painting will like it less if they discover it's a forgery  even if they initially loved it for its colors and shapes  not because it was painted by a famous artist. Nothing intrinsic to a painting changes after you discover it's a fake. The way something looks is a creation of your brain  not your eyes.
