  Our ancestors had to exercise. They had to engage in grueling physical labor in order to survive. They didn't have refrigerators; they didn't know how to farm; they couldn't buy food in stores or restaurants; there was no army or police force to protect them. Fear of death and the pains of hunger and thirst were strong-enough prompts to cause people to exercise. Evolution is not a goal-driven system. It does not purposefully try to endow us with positive feelings when we do something that's good for us.
