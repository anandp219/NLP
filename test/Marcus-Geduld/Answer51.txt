It's not something I keep in mind as an option. Marital problems are problems to be solved. I think of them the same way I think of food problems. If I was starving  I wouldn't say  "Well  maybe I'll just quit eating..." I'd find food. I'd steal it if I had to! Early on in our marriage  we had a talk about what would happen if one of us had an affair. I said to my wife  "Well  if it was an ongoing thing and you were in love with the other guy  that would be a problem. But if  say  you got drunk and had an 'accident ' I think we'd get past it.
