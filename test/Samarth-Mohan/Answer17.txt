  I'm a feminist because it's a no-brainer. I can't wrap my head around the concept that the two genders are anything but equal. I have lived and grown-up in a strongly patriarchal society  I've seen my mother  my sisters and my friends being treated differently  almost as second class citizens. And it incenses me. I've seen great human potential go to waste  only because this potential did not come blessed with a Y chromosome. To me feminism is a very simple concept  the two genders are equal and should  thus  be treated equally.I'm not out to do anyone a favour.
