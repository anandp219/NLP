  I think the touted similarities are tedious and trivial; at best  superficial:Calvin and The Narrator both have "imaginary friends" who they often blame for their own actions  Hobbes and Tyler both have a very dim view of human beings  Both of them often get into fights with their friends etc.... and err  that's about it.I did come across a bunch of sites [1] [2] waxing lyrical about the "OMG" similarities between the two  but the "hard evidence" presented in these cases was flimsy at best  and straw-grabby at worst.
