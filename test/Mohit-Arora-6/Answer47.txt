You can actually take a deep breath and think about your options.If I were at your place  I would have gone for the second choice. But as I said earlier  it differs from person to person. If you are mentally strong and adamant and you think that your surrounding and the pressure won't affect you or your decisions then you should surely go for the first choice. That way  even if you fail  the worst case scenario would be that you fallback to the second choice.
