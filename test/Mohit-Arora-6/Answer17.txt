  Because Bob was just too honest to do something like that. As I mentioned in one of my other answers  he was a kind of person who believed in non-violence until the time it is acceptable and tolerable. He also didn't believe in injustice.How many times we see a person picking a heavily injured dog from someone else's trash can  take care of it  and is ready to pay 10 000$ for it? Bob probably believed in a just world. Where everyone plays the role which has been assigned to them.It doesn't mean that Bob was weak.
