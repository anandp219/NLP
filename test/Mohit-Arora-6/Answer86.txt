  I cannot speak for myself because  according to me  I have a lot more followers than I deserve. But I agree to your general point  there are many good writers on Quora who are just unnoticed and there are a lot of reasons to account for this behavior. Off the top of my head I can think of three major reasons that  according to me  explain this phenomenon.1. Quora's machine learning algorithms - Whenever a new person joins Quora  they are asked to follow some people who Quora thinks would bring quality content to the user's feed.
