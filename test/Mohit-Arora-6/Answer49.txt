Season 2 was BAD. And season 3 is turning out to be pathetic. I don't know  it might be a very good serial for some people but I just don't get it.For me  a great show has an amazing plot and great acting. I do not want any special effects  any action scenes or other stunts. But this show lags both these things. There are so many loopholes in the story that sometimes I feel like the makers of the show think that their audience is a 5 years old kids who do not know what FBI does  or who are just so simple minded that they have no idea what happens in the real life.
