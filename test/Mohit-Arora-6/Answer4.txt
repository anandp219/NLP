  Steven has a very nice theory of Lockhart ratting out Sandy. Lockhart was definitely uneasy when Carrie told him that she knows that Lockhart knew Sandy was trading top secret information in exchange of the locations of terrorists. And his uneasiness makes sense because he authorized the demotion of Harris. So if it is proved that Harris was right and Sandy was indeed doing a "business" with the terrorists then Lockhart would be the first one to be hanged.But even though it has been established that Lockhart was doing something very wrong  I don't think he was responsible for leaking the photo of Sandy to the press.
