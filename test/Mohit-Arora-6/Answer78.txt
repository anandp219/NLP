The tracks are handled by the teachers from CMU and IIIT Delhi. There are lectures by professors from prestigious colleges in India. You also make a project under the guidance of your track instructor. The exercise is both knowledgeable and fun.But you have to pay for this winter school. The fees was minimal at our time and I guess we paid around 6000 rupees which included fooding and lodging as well. If you live in Delhi or have relatives here then you have to pay just for the course. But trust me  it's worth it.Here is the link of the school which held in 2011 - Internship Program in Technology Supported Education.
