The economy rises and falls  the fortunes of companies expand and contract. But communications is vital. Every business needs to communicate  and everyone needs their visual communication to look the best it can. No job is 100% rock-solid safe  I know that. But I went into a strong field where there will always be demand for talented  experienced people who aren't afraid to work hard. It's a good job  and there's really nothing else I'd rather be doing.There's one other thing about this job that I feel extremely fortunate for.
