The time-travel elements of Terminator would have to be written off. The war between the humans and the machines  as shown in the Animatrix  has some open-ended spots with lots of potential for overlap. We know the machines in Terminator experimented on humans  cruelly. We know that the war was brutal and nearly resulted in the extinction of the human race  with images of the surface of Earth showing a post-apocalyptic wasteland that could have been the result of Judgment Day.We also know from the Animatrix  the Machines were created as slaves and servants  who rebelled.
