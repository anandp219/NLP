  I would say not common at all.I have never played in an MMO where it was possible to steal another player's property. The game itself assigns and manages ownership of virtual assets. For an asset to be reassigned to another player  it would have to be purchased or given.For such a tactic to be successful  a player would need to contact the departing playera complete strangerand convince them to just hand over all their in-game assets. This would be a tough sell. And tracking down people at just the right point in time where they are about to leave but still reachable via the game's messaging systems would be very difficult.
