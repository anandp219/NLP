When you put something out there for the world to see  you don't want the recognition. You want your client (or employer) to get it  and if they do  you've done your job right.I've been a graphic designer for most of my life. Even as a child  I was artistic. (I was fully vaccinated.) When I was ten years old  I saw the movie Tron and was captivated by the visual effects and the idea that someone could be digitized and transported into a whole other world inside the computer. But I also found the ENCOM logo.... compelling  somehow.
