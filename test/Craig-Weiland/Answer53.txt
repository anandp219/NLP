Up to then I'd mostly done things like rsums  restaurant menus  t-shirts  some small business advertising  and so forth. However  one of our first big clients was a local McDonald's franchise  and at one point the franchise owners made available to us a thick book that had been put together by Kragie/Newell in Des Moines. It was their McDonald's brand bible. It was the coolest thing this aspiring designer had ever seen: how the various McDonald's logos and marks were meant to work. How ads should be laid out and balanced.
