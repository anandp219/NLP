  (Sorry  Archie  but there was an all-in-one Mac going back further than that.....! )The Macintosh PortableIt's 1990. I'm a freshman in college  and I'm working in a computer lab full of Mac SEs sharing a single LaserWriter II printer. I have to work in the Mac lab because I couldn't afford my owncollege kids with their own computers were still fairly uncommonand laser printers were very expensive  so to get a decent quality print of a document  you had to bring your files to the lab and print them there.So I'm sitting at one of the SEs and doing whatever  and I see a guy come in with a jet black case with an Apple logo on it.
