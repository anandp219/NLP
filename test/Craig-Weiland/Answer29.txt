  Vesper Lynd: How was your lamb?James Bond: Skewered. One sympathizes.Casino Royale (2006)You can't appreciate this line without understanding the conversation that led up to it. Bond has tried to impress Vesper (by way of demonstrating his ability to win at poker) with his "read" on her  summing up how much he can glean about her personality and behavior going on nothing more than his first impression of her  the few minutes they have spent discussing the mission together for the first time. Vesper doesn't admit to what degree his assessment is true  but instead launches into her own psychological deconstruction of him  which by his cool  unflinching composure she deduces (and the audience is led to agree) that she's been entirely accurate.Satisfied that she has turned his game back around on him  she asks him about his dinner  and Bond acknowledges that her insights have hit home.
