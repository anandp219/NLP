Sometimes  I was simply not interested in the domain  sometimes because my input was not valued  and sometimes  the energy of the company was utterly flat.This was the case in my last bad job. I took it because it seemed promising. It was in the field of genetics  which I've always found fascinating  and there were lots of Ph.D.s on staff  so lots of opportunities to learn. On paper  it was awesome. However  there was simply no energy there.I've been working in and around games for a long time. The crowd tends towards younger and energetic.
