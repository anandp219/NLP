  Most of them. Unless you're doing something that specifically involves calculus  like scientific programming or some kinds of computer graphics  calculus will probably never come up.But calculus is going to be required for practically every computer science program  because that's "college level math". The basic level of required calculus should not be difficult for anybody with the kind of rigorous  mathematical thinking required for computer science. It's also a prerequisite for basic college-level science classes like physics and chemistry.
