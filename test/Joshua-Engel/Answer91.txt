  The first thoughts that came to my mind were variations on "eggs". There are already a couple of answers to that effect already  so I won't repeat them. But I will reinforce the idea: an egg is incredibly easy to cook  requires little equipment and practically no skill  and is very filling and nutritious. Keep a dozen eggs in your kitchen  plus some kind of fat to lubricate the pan  and a bit of salt  and you've got several different meals right there that require little more technique than "make egg hot and stuff into face hole".
