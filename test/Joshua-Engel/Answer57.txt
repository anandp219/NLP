Others will become bigger  smaller  faster  slower  less or more energetic  etc etc etc. These are the same kinds of changes that have been present throughout history  but they're going to occur considerably faster (over a century or so  rather than millennia or longer)  which is going to put a lot of pressure on them to react. And the ones that go extinct will put even more pressure on the ones that relied on them through the Rube Goldberg chain of dependence.So the actual adaptations directly to climate change are going to be far smaller than the total evolution that occurs.
