It's really hard to express just how big that number is. It's the age of the universe in nanoseconds  if that helps. And since all you've sent is a single particle  you haven't sent even a whole atom  much less the kinds of relationships between atoms.So it's not clear if it's even meaningful to talk about scaling this up to objects even as big as a molecule  much less an object. It certainly isn't like breaking down somebody into particles and then beaming the particles somewhere to be reassembled; the one thing you're explicitly NOT doing is sending the particles.
