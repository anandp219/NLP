Slavic is just right out; the Elvish languages wouldn't have shared even so much as a Proto-Indo-European root with them. To my knowledge Tolkien didn't even speak any Slavic languages  though as a philologist he was probably at least passingly familiar with them.Tolkien's story began from Norse and Scandinavian roots  though it evolved so far from them that they're practically unrecognizeable. The Finnish story of Kullervo is obvious in the story of Turin Turambar  but it wasn't a conscious attempt to create a pan-European myth.
