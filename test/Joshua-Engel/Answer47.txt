Model simulations of such a scenario predict a decrease in global OH and an increased lifetime of methane  caused primarily by the reduction of the NOx emissions. The sign of the change in climate forcing caused by carbon dioxide and methane depends on the technology used to generate the molecular hydrogen. A possible rise in atmospheric hydrogen concentrations is unlikely to cause significant perturbations of the climate system.The was supported in a 2005 paper that took a broader view of the effects (though a US-centric accounting of the lives saved):Cleaning the Air and Improving Health with Hydrogen Fuel-Cell VehiclesConverting all U.S. onroad vehicles to hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (HFCVs) may improve air quality  health  and climate significantly  whether the hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of natural gas  wind electrolysis  or coal gasification.
