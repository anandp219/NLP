  Suppose you have 100 units of energy  and 10 particles in your system.There are only a very small number of ways for one of those 10 particles to have 100 units of energy; that number is ten). Similarly  there are not many ways for one to have 90 and each of the others to have 1 (again  10).However  there are lots of ways for each of them to have nearly 10 each:(11 9 11 9 11 9 11 9 11 9)(10 10 10 10 10 10 11 9)(12 8 10 10 10 10 11 9)etc etc etc. Combinatorically  the numbers go up very  very  very fast when you try to distribute the numbers evenly.
