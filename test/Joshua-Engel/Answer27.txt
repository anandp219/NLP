  The only useful data point we have is in the passage that Jeremiah Burns quoted:And thou  Melkor  shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me  nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful  which he himself hath not imagined.Basically it means  "Yeah  you think it sucks  but there's a Plan. Really. Trust me." Which is largely the Catholic theodicy that appears throughout Tolkien's work.
