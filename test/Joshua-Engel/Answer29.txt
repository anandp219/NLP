It's the undeserved salvation granted by God.None of this makes a lot of sense to somebody who doesn't already believe... which is kind of the point by definition. The argument at that point becomes as much epistemological as theological; there's reasoning around an idea that specifically calls for no reason. But within the fictional world  it's as good an answer as any. We have "firsthand" information that Iluvatar has a plan  even though nobody knows what it is.
