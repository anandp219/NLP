Vibhishan got a kingdom but have you seen any parent naming their child as Vibhishan? No  because it identifies with the word "traitor". But Vibhishan was happier being a devotee and a traitor than supporting Ravana. Karna got all the respect but had to suffer death in the battle. He preferred to die than to live and be considered as a traitor.So both were right because they consciously made their decision to go to the route they went and happily accepted the consequences.
