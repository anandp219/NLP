However hard anyone tries  the birds will neither learn to fly nor hunt like a lion  and they would lose all their confidence. Similarly  forcing the children to become an engineer or a doctor without respecting their interests kill all their dreams to fly.What if the parent birds teach their baby birds only to compete against other birds for food? Wouldn't the birds then only concentrate on food? From the Montessori itself Indian students are just told to get good marks. If that's what the goal is for a student  and also the only way to earn respect in the society  then why waste time thinking outside the box?Beside the society and parents  students are to be blamed too.
