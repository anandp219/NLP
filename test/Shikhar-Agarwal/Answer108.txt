  No  not at all. Dowry is a social menace and no action on the part of the girl can justify you asking for it. If any of her questions and concerns make you feel uncomfortable  then you have the privilege to walk out of talks  but falling to the level of asking dowry only deserves punishment by law.I don't want to be rude  but want you to realize that there is a fundamental flaw not only in your argument  but also in your attitude. You wish to compare oranges to oranges but what comparison would you make for the fact that after marriage she would leave her comfortable house  her blood relatives  her childhood friends  her freedom and her dreams to continuously sloth for a total stranger and his family (which happens in typical scenarios)?
