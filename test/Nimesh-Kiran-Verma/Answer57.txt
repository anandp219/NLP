Actually I regretted a lot for not coming up-to you for a chat  yesterday! And it resulted in the status! You did a great favor to me by not commenting But I spotted you at my status. Anyways Hows Life?She: Oh that status was for me?? Now Im surprised(Shit 2 : Feeling Naked and so vulnerable that you ask her out at that very  moment )Me: Actually I couldnt react When I saw you.. May be the bees and butterflies from the past erupted in my belly Anyways I might be pushing my luck too much here but still Will you be free any time on Mon or Tues or later  for a coffee etc ??
