On the other end of the spectrum is completely redesigning the experiment from scratch  and one hopes it doesn't come to this. In between is where the most progress is made. It is hard to specify a course of action without knowing the specific experiment and the specific difficulty  but I can give some general advice.Get organized. Make a list of the things that might be going wrong  and formulate a strategy for isolating/troubleshooting each of these variables.Get some sleep. It is easy to get into a rut of trying things  failing  and then trying a similar thing  and this cycle can sap your creativity.
