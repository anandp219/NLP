  Most of the top Kenyan runners come from a single tribe--the Kalenjin people (which make up a sizable minority of Kenya's population). Runners who win on the world stage in the modern era  regardless of their country of origin  are genetic freaks of nature. Still  there are certain physiological and cultural traits which happen more frequently among the Kalenjin which may explain why Kenya can successfully identify and groom to world's top male and female distance runners. Many of the arguments below are derived from The Sports Gene by David Epstein.PhysiologyThe Kalenjin people evolved in the hot lowlands and moved to the highland more recently  so their general physiology--longer and thinner limbs and shorter stature-- is optimized for dissipating heat.
