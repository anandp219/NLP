There are costs associated with distilling this small constituent from the rest of the gas  and the effort is only worthwhile if prices are high enough.Non-renewable:The earth is not producing new uranium and thorium  so that which exists on earth is pretty much the only source of heliumOnce helium is released into the atmosphere  it becomes uneconomical to recover it because it is so diffuse--only 0.000524% (see: Atmosphere of Earth)Demand:As the smallest non-reactive atom  helium is the only element that can be used to detect small cracks in vessels that need to be able to withstand extreme pressures (both low and high)As the cryogen with the lowest boiling temperature  helium is extensively used in research applications  such as the Large Hadron Collider as well as low temperature physics labs at your local university.
