Running every run in its entirety as fast as possible is a recipe for burnout and/or injury.Longer runs are important  even for a 5K. Professional 5K runners typically have 16-20 milers in their training program. A serious recreational runner might have 10-20 milers. If covering the full distance is not an issue for you and you want to improve your performance  run some 5-8 milers at least.Race daySeed yourself correctly at the starting line. If you have no estimate of your projected finish time  do not line up right at the front  and do not toe the start line unless you are likely to place in the top 10.
