This is the principle behind auger electron spectroscopyStep 2: the energized electron can collide with other electrons as it travels to the surface and impart some of its energy. If this energy is enough to exceed the work function and the second electron manages to make it to the surface  it can also be photoemitted. If the photon energy  and hence the first electron's kinetic energy  is very large  such a scattering event can happen multiple times and possibly lead to the photoemission of more than two electrons.
