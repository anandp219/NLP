  Cesium is the metal with the lowest work function (2.1 eV). Sodium and potassium are not far behind. All fun  safe metals to work with. Work functions for various metals are listed here: Work Functions for Photoelectric EffectThe lower the work function  the more photoelectron yield one will get  given the solar spectrum on earth. The spectrum cutoff on the earth's surface is around 4eV  so any metal with a work function below that (e.g. Ca  Mg  U) can yield photoelectrons due to solar radiation  provided there is no oxide layer on top and the experiment is performed in a vacuum chamber.Solar spectrum on earth (top).
