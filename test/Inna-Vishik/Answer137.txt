In this case  the approach one could take to put a theoretical limit on Tc is to pick a mechanism among those that have been suggested and consider the factors that have been empirically shown to raise Tc in cuprates. Some of these factors are charge carrier concentration (doping)  the apical oxygen height  the magnetic exchange energy J  and disorder. If any of these factors play into a given proposed theory  one can answer how much a given variable can raise Tc within a given proposed theory which might or might not be the correct one.If someone is completely agnostic about the material and the mechanism of superconductivity--perhaps thinking about materials which have not been discovered yet--it is very difficult to put an upper limit on Tc.
