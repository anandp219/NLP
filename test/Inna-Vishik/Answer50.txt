Seriously  people? fucking jupiter?? )  so I thought I would address this here.BackgroundAll of the helium-4 on earth is produced via radioactive decay of uranium and thorium  and hence there is a finite amount which can ever exist. Moreover  once it is released into the atmosphere  it becomes so diffuse that it is stupid expensive to recover it. Finally  the helium which does exist in the atmosphere is slowly being released into space because of its low atomic mass. Thus  helium is a non-renewable resource on earth and one which is non-substitutable for some applications  particularly for leak-checking certain types of pressure or vacuum vessels and for cooling things down close to absolute zero temperature for scientific study.
