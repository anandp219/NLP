This is why carbon-based superconductors need some other source of electrons. Diamond can superconduct if it is doped with a lot of boron. Buckeyballs can form fullerene superconductors when they are arranged into a crystal lattice together with alkali metal atoms. And graphene can superconduct if it gets extra electrons from calcium atoms  and the paper linked in the details studied the electronic structure of these materials using ARPES (see Inna Vishik's answer to What kind of qualitative and quantitative information can be obtained from ARPES?)
