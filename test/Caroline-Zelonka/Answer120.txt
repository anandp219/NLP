  College  for many students  is a highly social time. Students find themselves surrounded by new friends  and want to spend time enjoying one another's company. At the same time  many of them are discovering the pleasures of drinking. Alcohol is something enjoyed by people of all ages at parties  so it makes sense that college students will enjoy it  too.Sure  it's illegal. But it's not like the cops are running around throwing college students in jail for drinking. The likelihood of getting caught are very minor  especially if you are drinking at a private residence.
