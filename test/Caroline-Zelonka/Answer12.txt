Be excellent.Ok  this sound a bit "Bill and Ted" but it's key for maintaining steady freelance work. Everyone wants a writer who is good  fast and reasonable. And nobody can expect all three  really. Most successful freelancers will hit on two out of three things (less-experienced writers may be good and cheap  but not especially fast  compared to their senior counterparts). But you can also increase your value by being reliable (sticking to your deadlines  being quick to answer email  showing up on time and prepared for meetings).
