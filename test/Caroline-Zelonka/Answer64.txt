Towering mountains  gigantic evergreen trees  crystalline rivers. And bears. Lots of bears. It was not uncommon for these bears to come poking around the campsite  looking for food. During these times  my dad would make all the kids get into the car for protection  while he make bearlike sounds and gestures to make the animal go away. (It worked.) He's not the biggest guy around  but he wasn't afraid of no bears.On one of these trips  I was on a walk with my two sisters. I was eight  Mary was seven  and Joanne was four.
