A teen with dyed black hair and nose piercings may not be taken seriously by the coach of the debate team. Anyone who thinks the surface is an illusion is wrong. It's true that we should strive to pay less attention to surface presentation  but we also cannot ignore its effects.I'm not the most brilliant person in the world  but yes  I would consider myself an intelligent person. And I fight the tyranny of body image every day. Even in my 40s  when some folks may think it's high time to give up the fight.
