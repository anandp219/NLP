But I realize that if I presented myself without concern to the way I appeared to others  I might not have such an easy time getting a job  or a date  or my grievances heard in court.It's not just my body  it's the way it appears when it is out in the world (because unless they live in a nudist colony  nobody is going to make a first impression as a naked being). And it's not like I worry -- as in have undue anxiety -- about it. But it's something I consider  with good reason  and I imagine many intelligent people do so as well.
