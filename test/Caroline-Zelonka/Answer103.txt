Even models and celebrities are often caught off guard  looking less than picture-perfect  and these images are highly accessible as well. As to whether individual people think they are better- or worse-looking than they actually are  this can depend on the day and situation  as well as the psychological makeup of the individual. But in this day and age  I think people are much more likely to make accurate comparisons of how their looks stack up to others'  mostly because there is much more fodder for comparison.
