When the houses were spaced well apart  I could eat my sandwich in one sitting; otherwise it would have to be divided into as many as three separate  hasty snacks.In a customer's house  nothing was to touch our lips at all  not even water - a rule that  on hot days  I sometimes broke by drinking from a bathroom tap. TVs and radios were off-limits  and we were never  ever  to curse out loud  even in an ostensibly deserted house. There might be a homeowner secreted in some locked room  we were told  ear pressed to the door  or  more likely  a tape recorder or video camera running.
