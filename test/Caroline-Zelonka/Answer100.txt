  One of the benefits of the widespread prevalence of photos is that people are being exposed to more images of real people. Twenty years ago  this wasn't the case. Most images you encountered were on TV or in print. Many were professionally shot  probably styled and posed as well  culled from a series of photos which may have included some not-so-flattering images.Today  I'd venture to guess the average person on social media views hundreds of portraits (and full-body shots) before they fully wake up in the morning.
