  In order to run for Prime Minister  one must first be a Member of Parliament (MP)  and be the leader of the political party which is able to form a majority (either alone or in coalition with others).Given that no monarch has entered the House of Commons since 1642  when Charles I stormed in to attempt to arrest some MPs  it would be impossible for her to do the job of MP.Note well that many very important principles in the UK constitutional system are longstanding traditions and conventions rather than written legislation.
