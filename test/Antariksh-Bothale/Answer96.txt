This can be very fascinating  and very revealing  since they had probably never looked at their native language in that light. For instance  Hindi speakers might tell you that the Hindi spelling system is very phonetic and exactly represents words as they are spoken  but probably never realized that they pronounce a word like  in     differently from that in     (the nasalization in the terminal vowel of the second word is irrelevant to the example).There's also another factor in play here. Some people might still associate 'complexity' with language superiority or with a language being more developed / advanced / evolved (or similar pseudo-scientific terminology) based on how complex it is.
