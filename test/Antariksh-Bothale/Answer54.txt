It is also likely to lead to a more enriching undergraduate / graduate experience. But it is neither necessary nor sufficient for being 'successful' in life  and this probably stands true for a widely diverse range of metrics of success.IITians would do well to realize (if there are those that already don't do so) that the IIT on their resume doesn't give them a trump card or an all-access pass  and those who could not get into IIT despite wanting to would be well-advised to not consider their academic background a major impediment.This is true for the IITs  just as it is true for top US schools  and I don't think Satya Nadella's appointment has changed that.
