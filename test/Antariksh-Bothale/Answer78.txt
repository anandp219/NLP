And finally  as a few others pointed out  it's sometimes worthwhile to maintain 'deep orthography'. Since the words writer and rider are homophones in many US dialects  would you necessarily gain more by expressing the action of writing as write but the person who performs the action as raiduhr (or whatever system is chosen)?These are only some of the issues. Like it or not  at some level  spelling representations serve as abstractions of the underlying phonetic forms. Moreover  they are usually not expected to convey information to a person not familiar with the language.
