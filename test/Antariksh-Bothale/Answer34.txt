  There are many ways in which running marathons seems to be well-placed as a fund-raising activity  and appeals to us more than many other fund-raising mechanisms.From the POV of the fund-raiserRunning is an activity that is accessible to almost all of us. Barring specific cases of handicap  everyone can run  no matter how old  young  thin  fat  tall  short  and no matter what their general athletic condition is. Everyone and their grandmother  almost quite literally  can run. There has also been research demonstrating that the human body is particularly well-suited for long distance running.In continuation of the above  running is largely money-agnostic.
