The fact that Lithuanian is often said to be the closest modern language to the Proto-Indo-European whereas Latvian is not tells that they are not mutually intelligible. Latvian also has a lot of Finnic influence.Finnish and Estonian are close relatives but not fully mutually intelligible. They began diverging from the same proto-language approximately 2000 years ago  so they have had time to develop differences. Finnish and Estonian have many phonological  grammatical and lexical differences. Sometimes you can guess the meaning but many times you guess wrong.
