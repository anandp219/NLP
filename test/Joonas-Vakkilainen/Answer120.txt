Because the Britonic language  which is the ancestor of the Insular Celtic languages  was spoken there before the Roman and Anglo-Saxon invasions  it is seen as an old language  which just does not have any rationale. Based on the case of Irish Gaelic  we could say that Italian is a very old language because it has been spoken there for ages. The reason people don't say that is that Latin is seen as a separate language: it is written in a different way as Italian  it is studied as an independent language  it has a lot of written texts that are not intelligible with Italian and it is still used as a language for example by the Roman Catholic Church.
