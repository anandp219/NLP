The dominance of English also leads to some kind of bias of how people see languages. If you ask for example Finnish people  both school children and adults  which is the easiest language and which is the hardest one  you'll get English for the first question and always something else for the latter one. People find English easy because of its constant presence. Because of that  people tend to think that the easiness of English is due to its grammar. I learned German for many years at school and many students complained how hard it was.
