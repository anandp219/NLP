  Anton Ego from Ratatouille In many ways  the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little  yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism  which is fun to write and to read.

But there are times when a critic truly risks something  and that is in the discovery and defense of the new.
