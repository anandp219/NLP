  My memory is recent  so I'll give this one a go. I saw Roger Federer play Sam Groth in 2nd round at US Open 2014 in Arthur Ashe Stadium (Queens  NYC) on 27th August. He's been not just my favorite tennis player  but favorite sportstar for quite a long time and needless to say seeing him live from the stands is an extremely fulfilling experience. Moreover I didn't know I'm seeing him till an hour before the match as I'd booked tickets previous day in extreme hurry [1]  so the added shock & excitement made my experience even better.
