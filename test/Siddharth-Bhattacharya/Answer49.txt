Compensating providers is just a part of the net price  there are many other administrative costs as well. However the caveat should be the word basic necessities and defining what classifies as basic healthcare. Just like subsidized food wouldn't entitle receiver to world-class biryani and caviar  subsidized healthcare wouldn't mean world-class healthcare and free cure of cancer. The higher the specialty  the higher the cost of hiring the doctor which is from taxpayer's pocket. To summarize my viewpoint  even though free healthcare is not a fundamental right  as a morally responsible society we must take minimal responsibility to provide basic healthcare facilities to ensure no one has to face ordeal due to uncomplicated illnesses (which can be treated by a general physician) at subsidized/ free costs  while ensuring no provider is forced to deliver services at lesser than their skills mandate.
