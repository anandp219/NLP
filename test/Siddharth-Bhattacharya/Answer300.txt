In general I figured military does have a lot of power.Beautiful Buddhist buildings: Ok  there is nothing surprising about it so that's why this is at the bottom as a compulsory addition. I expected amazing Buddhist architecture  found it. There are floating markets as well  with lots of temples on the sides. Overall it's beautiful. What did surprise me however was the numerous Hindu temples.Pic: Beautiful Buddhist buildings clicked from Wat Arun
