Even the under-developed island of Koh Phangan (from an infrastructure perspective) is not that bad. Prostitution is illegal  but...: I'd read before on the legal status of prostitution in Thailand and it stuck me as odd  given the international reputation it has for this. So the question was- how is the law enforced? To my surprise  there is not the slightest trace of brothels so the law has controlled that part. I'm comparing it to Amsterdam's Red Light Districts which is in the city center  every passerby can see it and access (if they wish).
