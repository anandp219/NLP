  I'd tweak the question a bit without destroying the sense. While growing up & in college  I'd always been intrigued by the thought of being able to work for Google/ Microsoft (I changed FB to MS-- Google FB MS  Amazon anyways comprise the "top 4" for software devs from top colleges). The reasons I give might differ from an American perspective  since I don't have experience of growing up in US. Also I'd provide with reasons why people are obsessed about working for these companies than actually the reasons people choose to work for them.
