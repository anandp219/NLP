Even my first bits of "programming" was fiddling with MS-DOS and (MS) VB6. Even though there were many instances of Blue Screen of Death  hard-disk crashes; overall impact Windows had on my life was way more  as well as my inclination to experiment with tools like PPT creating animations with sports  cartoons. Irrespective of whether the companies continued to innovate after that  at about age 17/18 the charm with them was deeply sealed along with the fascination "what would be it like to work for these amazing guys?"
