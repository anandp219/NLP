  I am an atheist. I get irritated everytime a religious argument is used for constraining me from doing something I like of the form "You can't do it because God won't approve of it" or "religious scriptures say so". Nevertheless unlike other answers here  I will say the need for religion still exists. While rejecting religion absolutely  we forget the current state of morality we take for granted- which humans should understand themselves even without the concept of God- a possibility that without religion such morality may never have existed.
