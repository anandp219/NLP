But they know- if they do God will punish them. And if they don't- God will help them by bringing hope into their lives  sufficient enough to live another day. So powerful is the concept of a God. Of course fear and punishment can be achieved through legislation rather than through God. But when governments take the power assigned to God into their own hands  we get authoritarian regimes like Soviet with bad records of human rights. Therefore having religion is a safer bet than granting more regulatory power to authorities for punishments.
