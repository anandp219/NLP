So your aim is to align these individual efforts. For that  you must establish trust amongst them. The first step would be moral codes:"Don't steal from thou neighbor". Nevertheless some don't take this to heart committing acts detrimental to establishing this trust. So what would you do when moral preaching fails? You make these codes stronger by incorporating punishments. To facilitate this you exploit the mysteries of the universe  attribute them to an omnipotent character and call it 'God'. Now this God with all it's power can punish.
