Each decision  every single day regarding social life during winters faces the mental barrier "but it's so cold outside". I should rather just stay inside.The image is not from the internet  but a photo I clicked in front of my apartment. Needless to say  I didn't stay outside more than 10 minutes even while photographing. The temperatures are way below freezing- I don't even see them with windchills because it depresses me more- but during the days it was declared "Polar Vertex" it went down to -30 degrees Celsius (-22 F).
