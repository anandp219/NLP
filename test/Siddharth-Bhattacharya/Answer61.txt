Personally I dislike both 1 and 2 a lot  and why I wouldn't like a non-Modi led BJP-led coalition is because- 1) this coalition will face policy paralysis like UPA-II as well; 2) Modi has a good development track record  other leaders don't; 3) some of these other leaders are closer to RSS. Unless one is strictly anti-BJP and considers them worse than Congress as well as third-front  the best polling strategy is to vote for BJP. By 2019 however my opinion on voting for AAP may change given their track record in states  how much they can work as a team.
