Has she not greater intuition  is she not more self-sacrificing  has she not greater courage? Without her man could not be. If non-violence is the law of our being  the future is with womanThese are the words of Barack Obama: The best judge of whether or not a country is going to develop is how it treats its women. If it's educating its girls  if women have equal rights  that country is going to move forward. But if women are oppressed and abused and illiterate  then they're going to fall behind.So it's neither unheard of for successful men to be condescending of girl's rationality nor unheard of successful and intelligent men upholding their cause.
