Did I spend $ 1000 for a Mac? No  I downloaded Linux for free  got a dual OS partition in my cheap Dell and guess what- I get the real Unix  no viruses and I am richer by not spending. There was a learning curve for sure  but the lack of additional money justified the effort combined with the fact it was no more difficult than programming itself. When I needed to play games/ use Office suites (LibreOffice was a pain) I used Windows  else Linux (mainly to stay virus-safe). Eventually I switched back to Windows full-time.
