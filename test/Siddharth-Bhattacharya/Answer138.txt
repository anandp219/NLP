  Mac might be great for someone who's never used a computer- for dummies. Getting all that fancy stuff  sexy interface  intuitive UI etc. Mac might also be excellent for high-end users who use their PCs/laptops for lots of fancy stuff. What you've remaining is the large middle-area of the bell-curve: people like me who are neither dummies  nor use it to perform high computational tasks and most importantly have grown up on Windows. Most people who can afford a Mac today (the question's target audience) couldn't at some point in their life  when they were using Windows.
