The movie is spilled with intense scientific jargon. If you aren't a scientist  you'll be splitting hairs anyways making sense. If you are a stalwart: you're probably feel like this (Jay Wacker) or this (Robert Frost) or this hilarious review by Dan or Sandy citing observations with scientific inaccuracies baffled at the nonsense. Either way  you'd be splitting hairs at the science  so my advice is to ignore the details and just trust the actors in whatever scientific they say.Also remember beforehand the movie is 3 hours long.
