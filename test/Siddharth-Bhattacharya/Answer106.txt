Unite them by a common identity. Lo behold! People got emotional & started working in the same direction. But the story doesn't end here- slight twist. Just as few didn't take 'God' seriously  few don't buy this nation argument. Unfortunately you've to resort to the same method as before- fear. You tell them if they deviate from sticking together & working in an aligned manner  some other similar entities ('nations') would threaten them. Many more believe  but some still remain. Where are these other nations they ask?
