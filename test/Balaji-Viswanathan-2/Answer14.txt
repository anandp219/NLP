  A lot of us naively believe that we can build our new cities without taking any bit of agricultural or forest land. The fact is that there is hardly any good land left in India that somebody is not already using for something. 40 000 acres is about 161 sq km. That is barely enough for a major city. London and New Delhi are about 10 times bigger than that. If things go by plan  up to a quarter of Andhra's 5 crore people will live in this major metropolis extending from Guntur to Vijayawada. How do you accommodate that big a population with all their apartments  schools  roads and hospitals?Maybe AP could build its capital in western Rayalseema districts without a lot of fields.
