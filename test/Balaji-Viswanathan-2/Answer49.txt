  By sheer coincidence or impeccable timing  both of India's nuclear tests came at a time when a US President was on the verge of getting impeached. A President getting impeached is a very rare event and it puts the whole administration in disarray  unable to focus on the world. When a US President is distracted  words of rest of Western allies have no biting power.In 1974  India tested one device and didn't openly state it as a weapon. It called it a peaceful explosion. To prove the point  India conducted the tests on Buddha Jayanthi - the birthday of Buddha.
