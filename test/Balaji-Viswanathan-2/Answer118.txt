  The fundamental difference between liberals and conservatives is in how much of the past/present should be preserved for the future. Liberals are permissive and believe in the winds of change. Conservatives on the other want want to preserve the existing structures. Conservatives are more likely to value group memberships [family  race  religion  nation] as groups ensure stability. Liberals tend to value group memberships less [with the exception of labor unions] as groups slow down change.They have different views because they often have different experiences.
