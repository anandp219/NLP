  Siddhartha was probably born in Nepal. But  Buddha was born in India ;-)That is a cheeky way of saying both nations can claim ownership of him and that the India-Nepal division didn't exist at the time of Buddha. In that sense  Buddha was like William the Conqueror who though born in what is now France is mostly associated as the King of England. Buddha was born in the capital town of the Shakya kingdom. There is no agreement on where exactly this capital was. There are 3 close towns that each claim to be the birthplace of Siddhartha and the capital of that kingdom.
