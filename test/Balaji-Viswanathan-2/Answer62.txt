  Humans grew up in groups and we are social creatures. Group loyalty is a part of our evolution and one of our survival technique. Instead of just thinking about just ourselves  we widen the circle to care for the group. Pride and loyalty are side effects of that relationship.The circles start with the family  then widens to include the tribe and then the region  language  religion  culture and so on. Until a few centuries ago  the circle had not fully widened to include nations. People still thought about their villages or regions.
