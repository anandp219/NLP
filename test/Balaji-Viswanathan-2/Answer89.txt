It was at this time that a lot of Germans  Italians  Irish and other Europeans took the boats to escape the chaos. They settled in large numbers in the US and elsewhere. However  by then England and other powers had already setup their culture. Thus  even when Germans rivalled the English in numbers in North America  US & Canada never turned German  but remained British. Britain's colonies ended in two extremities. On one end you have prosperous ones like US & Australia and on other end you have Myanmar  Zimbabwe  Sudan  etc.
