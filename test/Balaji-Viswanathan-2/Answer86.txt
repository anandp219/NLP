Only a few young men were sent and they would return after their mission. No major families or settlements abroad. Spanish and Portuguese settled more than the French and Dutch  but still were not moving as much as the English. [South Africa was one exception for the Dutch. There they Dutch stayed in large numbers & had a prosperous nation that was at the same time the worst for the natives. ]In that wave of English colonies - US  Canada  Australia and New Zealand - the locals were mostly driven out to remote settlements and the English immigrants totally took over the land.
