  The best way to answer this is through the process of elimination.Because I cannot talk.Well  I can  but for me to open up my heart to you verbally  I need to know you  really like you (and vice versa) and you need to be a really good listener. I am an introvert  and very sensitive to what responses I get. I also take time to open up; people typically respond with their experiences when I narrate mine  and that turns me off. I expect you to get involved in what I am telling  just as I get involved in what you tell  and if that doesn't happen consistently  I cease to express.These aren't qualities to have if you want to speak to a group or to a new person.Because I am not artistic.Yes  I do play the keyboard a bit  and dance a bit  and embroider a bit.
