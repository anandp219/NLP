  Most answers here have covered almost all factors that cause Indians to break traffic rules. Many of them are actually within the individual's control  while many are due to social  peer and institutional forces. There are two factors  however  which I feel are hugely at work and not been adequately considered. They are -The tendency to 'fix it' (modifiable at the individual level)The inconvenience of commuting/travelling in India (largely out of individual's control)The average Indian routine is multi-dimensional  spread out  and chaotic.
