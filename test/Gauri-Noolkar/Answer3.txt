  9% sounds awfully low - do you mean to say it is the mother tongue of 9% of the world's population? I don't know how accurate that will be either.However  I can try answering your question as to why it is called a global language. Whatever be the proportion of people speaking English  it is evident that this proportion is more widely dispersed across the globe  essentially planting the presence of English in more regions. This means that English literature  movies  music and theatre will find audience over a larger geographical area.
