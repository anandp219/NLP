  Firstly  I am a bit sceptical about using characters from the Mahabharata for discussing Good/Bad/Evil  largely because it is extremely difficult to classify them into any one category. They all have their share of virtues and vices  and thus any black and white inferences/conclusions would be not only woefully adequate but also rather unhelpful and even misleading.Bringing the question in a general perspective - yes  being bad and evil can have certain benefits in the short term. "Bad" and "evil" are rather vague terms and can encompass a lot of actions  but I will limit my interpretation to causing harm  direct or indirect  mental or physical or otherwise  to another being out of purely non-defense and selfish motives for the sake of simplicity in this answer.Being bad/evil to achieve one's goals is nothing new  and that is precisely because it is a time-tested technique.
