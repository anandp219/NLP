This often conflicts with their emotional needs  and it is a long struggle for most exceptionally intelligent people unless they completely transform their personalities and gain the necessary skills to attract multiple strong relationships  or accept that they would always share a rapport with a customised and slim selection of people.Contrary to question details  I have assumed intelligence to be beyond "really good in studies"  though I am sure these points would apply more or less to those who are academically brilliant as well.
