Mumbai might very well be an international city  but the rest of the state is very much 'Indian'; a majority lives in towns and villages  is fairly religious and traditional  and less individualistic when compared to Mumbai. A Mumbaikar who has never ventured into the nooks and corners of Maharashtra would be surprised to know that many of his norms (or things he takes for granted) are their anomalies and even taboos. Gender norms  family life  concepts of privacy and social life  materialistic tastes and preferences  and overall attitudes towards life are very different and more liberal in Mumbai  and more often do not match those of rest of Maharashtra.
