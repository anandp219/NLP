  The average Indian knows very little about Iran  and apart from "Muslim country"  "conservative towards women"  and "America-hater"  it doesn't register much on his/her consciousness.Those who know a bit of history (and they are many)  and that ancient Iran was known as Persia  associate Iran with having close ties with our own history. Cultural  culinary  linguistic and religious exchanges are quite widely acknowledged. Iran  then  is also associated with beautiful art and poetry  story-telling (some of the Arabian Nights tales  for example)  kings and invasions  and of course  beautiful women.We also associate Iran with a minority community largely concentrated on the western coast of India (Gujarat and Maharashtra) - the Parsees.
