Explore your mind  and surprise it regularly with new information  activities and ideas. Keep it busy  challenge it  pamper it  exhaust it. At the same time  give it a break  and the strength to listen to itself - most of us do not really let our thoughts roam our brains loud and clear  because we fear confronting them in totality  and all alone. We are in a denial mode about so many things. The fears  the lies we convince ourselves to believe  the criticism  the awkwardness and awe of some truly beautiful compliments you have ever received - they are all lurking in the corner of our minds which we regularly shut off by engaging it with other people  things and actions.
