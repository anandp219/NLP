  Is there a war? A race? A match? I don't see how modernisation and Indian culture are at loggerheads. In fact  if anything else  Indian culture is flexible enough to take modernisation in its stride  and it has been doing so  slowly  steadily  a bit haphazardly and illogically  but certainly. Indian culture is based on philosophies and spiritual/religious values which are flexible  and which can run as undercurrents through history and future as society changes and moulds itself. This is because these philosophies and values do not engage primarily with daily life - they deal with the fundamentalism of our existence  our purpose  our conscience and our actions.
