Do you think that's going to motivate them to want to join with the remaining 75% of the planet to tackle Islamic terrorism  or is it more likely to drive them to extremism? Human nature tells me that it's the latter; if 75% of the planet is telling me I'm a "bad person"  then I'm going to stick with the people who accept me. Even if some of them are brutes. We need to make it feel safe  and not a betrayal of their religion  for the 24%+ to ally themselves with non-Muslims.The only way to tackle the scourge of Islamic terrorism is to do it alongside those Muslims who share the western world's concerns.
