This is the kind of expansive  panoramic view of an art form that only critics can provide.Bad critics can tend to view their insights as little baubles to be coveted and teasingly flashed to readers in order to impress them  or just as references to be understood by their colleagues and uber-viewers who are in-the-know. Good critics can distill and COMMUNICATE these ideas to encourage a viewer to take up challenging films or find salvageable objects of interest in movies otherwise dismissable as trash.
