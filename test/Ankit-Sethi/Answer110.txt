That opened up the experiment for me a bit. After a few days of thought I've settled on the central idea being explored to be the ambiguities of consent and our role in grappling with it  as consumers and participants of sex.I don't give the "re-enactment" bit too much credence. At some level  OF COURSE it is  but that's just boring. She stands to distract from her message by calling it that. Her intent I believe is merely to use that experience as a template to illustrate the fuzzy nature of consent  how a consensual experience can turn unexpectedly not-so  and how a person might grapple with such an experience  and here I mean the audience  more than herself.Does the video's existence equate to us having her consent to watch it?
