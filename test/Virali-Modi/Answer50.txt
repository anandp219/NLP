Combining that with a light shade of concealer  usually two shades lighter than your foundation  and applying it under your eyes  the bridge of your nose  and your forehead can make you look bright. If you really want to enhance that glowy  bright look  you can add a highlighter on top of your cheekbones  your brow bone  your chin  your cupid's bow (the arch of your lip)  and the bridge of your nose. Like I said earlier  using products in moderation is the key to look "natural". Yes  using that much makeup can make you look natural  if you know how to use the products  how they mix with your skin  the right technique for you  and the right appliances for you.
