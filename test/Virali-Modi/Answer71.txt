  Please gather around my imaginary camp fire and listen to a story of my friend who projecticle vomited on me. I assure you  it's kind of funny.Yesterday (yes  this happened yesterday) a couple of friends and I were invited to my other friend's house for a house party. We were there from eleven at night until seven in the morning. It was pretty fun  to be honest. We were all joking around and pulling each other's legs. We were smoking some hookahs and snacking on banana chips. Suddenly someone has the brilliant idea of getting some alcohol  which I was dreading.
