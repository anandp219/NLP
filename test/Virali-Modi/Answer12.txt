Guess what? It's happened to me. My "friends" spread nonsensical rumors about me  which ultimately ruined my reputation. I don't wish to explain what happened  that's another answer in its own. What I'm trying to say is that most people might not understand you. They might take you and your feelings for granted  it might cause you pain. Yes  I have friends. I hang out with people  but I keep to myself a lot. I don't share my feelings with other people  because I cannot expect anyone to understand.
