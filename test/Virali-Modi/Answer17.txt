  When you become wheelchair bound  you learn to value each and every aspect of life. Initially  I couldn't breathe on my own. I had a tracheostomy done  which  in a nutshell  is when they pass a device through the vocal box to help someone breathe. I couldn't speak  they had to put a small "plug" on to the trache to help me talk  even then my voice was barely audible. You learn to appreciate oxygen. We really don't think about breathing  but when you have to have a machine to help you breathe  you realize how important it really is.I remember when I was in the ICU that they'd put me on trials for breathing.
