It's soft on the skin  it breaks down eyeliner and mascara really easily  and it's cheap. You don't have to rub and tug your delicate eye area to get your makeup off.6. To make any lipstick matte  I take a two ply tissue paper  separate it and press on sheet onto my lips  taking a translucent powder  I dust it over the sheet and I get instant matte lips.7. If I don't have an eyeliner available and I wish to define my eyes  I use an angled eyeliner brush and a mascara to line my eyes. I coat the eyeliner brush with mascara and use it to line and define my top lash line.
