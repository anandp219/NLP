It is very likely down to puberty too  so it likely will pass eventually  even without treatment.Good luck!Side-note: to add to the list  birth control is an option in controlling acne  but this one is tricky for the risks and complications (see: Birth Control for Acne Treatment: Types  Benefits  Risks  Birth control pills for acne? - Mayo Clinic). Either way  it is a good idea to find out all about what you're taking before you begin treatment. :)
