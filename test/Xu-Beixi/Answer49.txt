In a separate incident  I told a complete stranger her work dress was unzipped in the back; she smiled an embarrassed little smile and genuinely thanked me for it. "Hi  I'm really sorry  but... " in a soft tone tends to work very well- you're putting yourself in a position of relative weakness and therefore non-threatening to the receiver. I don't think the only factor at play is the gender(s) of the people involved  or even the degree of familiarity. I would say it's also your tone and body language  the mode of delivery  and context.
