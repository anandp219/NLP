  Since you've already apologized  I'll address the latter part;But I feel it's too late for us... I guess I'll keep my feelings to myself and see it as it is  we've had an opportunity and missed it. :(I respectfully disagree. Chris Rock  despite his penchant for yelling  speaks the truth when he says we're never going to meet the perfect person at the right time:Even if you meet the perfect person it aint gonna be at the perfect time.Youre married  theyre single. Thats right.Youre Jewish  theyre Palestinian.Youre a Mexican  theyre a raccoon.- Chris Rock  Never ScaredFurthermore  it sounds like he may have feelings for you too- how many men do you know of who have heart-to-heart conversations for hours and hours with women they previously dated whom they have no feelings for?In short; there's never a perfect time.
