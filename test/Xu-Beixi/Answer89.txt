  Oh  they're common. No worries. I notice them making appearances in old Chinese drama serials all the time  before editing and makeup became as advanced at they are. It may depend on why you have them  but there are some general treatments:Choose "comedolytic" topical medications. These should be applied once or twice daily as a thin smear to the entire area affected. It may take several weeks to months before worthwhile improvement occurs. Treatment needs to be continued long-term (sometimes for many years).Suitable topical agents include:Benzoyl peroxideAzelaic acidSalicylic acid +/- sulfur and resorcinolGlycolic acidRetinoids such as tretinoin  isotretinoin  adapalene (these require a doctor's prescription)Comedonal acne.
