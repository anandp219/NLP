  When I hear or read the word Pakistan  a flurry of words race through my mind. "Friends"  "family"  "sadness"  "separation"  "unity". My view of Pakistan  given that I've never been there  is colored by the Pakistani people I have had the privilege to know growing up and living in Switzerland. It's based on some Bollywood movies -more so than others- and it is largely influenced by my understanding of Indians. Last but not least  stories of other people who have gone to Pakistan or who live there.
