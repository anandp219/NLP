  The origin of a muscle is the point on a bone where it is said to 'start' as a rule  the origin tends to be higher up  or closer to the midline than the insertion. For the 'normal' action of a muscle  the origin remains immobile.The insertion is where the muscle attaches to another bone further down  or further from the midline. This is the bone the muscle 'acts' on. The action  finally  is what the muscle does. For example  the pectoralis major muscle adducts the arm (among many other things).
