  Disclaimer: Assessing you without having seen you personally is hard  if not impossible. If the popping when doing push-ups per se is painless (and the elbows remain painless after the push-ups)  then you probably don't have to worry about it. Sound is not necessarily a sign of damage. The lifts may give you some trouble because even if a bench press is the same in principle  it's a different challenge neurologically  and your body needs time to figure this out. Grab somebody knowledgeable  like a strength and conditioning coach  and have them help you out.If they do hurt  I recommed doing the following: Check your form  making sure you distribute the weight as evenly as possible over both your hands and also all of the arm joints (shoulders  elbows  wrists  fingers).
