)Finally  there has to be something about you that makes you unique  and different from the other fitness blogs out there. What that will be in your specific case is something you have to decide on. The most important part is to have fun along the ride  whether the blog carries you to stardom  or fails fantastically. Enjoy the experience  and learn from it. Thanks for the A2A  Anon.
