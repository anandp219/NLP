  If a single pull-up is all you need to do  and you can get your arms to just below ninety degrees  I recommend observing the following steps to nail your pull-up in time.Back Warm UpOne of the smartest ways to warm up of for a pull-up is to do a couple dozen jumping jacks  and then push your outstretched arms back  thumbs pointing backwards. Hold that position for a slow count of ten. Feel those upper back muscles working and maybe even burning a little.Chin-UpsChin-ups are almost the same move as pull-up  but they tend to be slightly easier for most people  as they involve the biceps a lot more.
