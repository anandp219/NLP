Expermint before competition. On the day of your race  you should be following your plan  not be in the process of writing it.ConclusionThere aren't many supplements out there that can credibly boast to enhance your performance - without being banned- but the basics hold up to scrutiny time and time again. Stick to water  carbs  some caffeine  maybe a multivitamin. Stay away from other stuff. It will cost you money  and might be useless at best  and harmful at worst. Thanks for the A2A  Scott Paglia.
