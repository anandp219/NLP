  Two things  because both were pretty weird.When I was little  I used to go to a kid's daycare where everybody spoke French. Most cartoons were in German  and we used to speak Hindi at home. I also  like Iwan  believed that everybody spoke Hindi at home (my Arabic  Portuguese  and Congolese friends  all of them)  French at our daycare and German on TV. It was just the way the world was. This was until the age of 3 or 4  before my mother taught me to read and write in English.The other one had to do with aging.
