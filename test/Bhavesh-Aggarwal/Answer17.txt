In my experience  these are both inaccurate. There are some individuals who do benefit from half reps  especially on the psychological front. Somebody who was always wanted to a pull-up and has now learned to do half of one will feel more rewarded than doing a negative pull up. If you can do half a pull up  train those together with negatives. You're likely to get to your goal faster.IsometricsYou can also practice an exercise by holding certain positions you attain in the process of doing them.
