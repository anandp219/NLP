This is rhetorical  because it is presenting the opinion that people want to make life difficult when they ask problematic questions. This comes across as insincere  because in reality I must know that most people have no idea who I am and how I might be affected by their questions.The only real answer is 'they don't want to make my life difficult'. However that's not really helpful because we still don't know why people ask these questions  which is the real question. We do appreciate though that asking these questions in this manner is very natural  and many people do it.
