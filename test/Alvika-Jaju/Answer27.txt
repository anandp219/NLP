  Thanks for A2A Angara Sreeniketh.A very interesting question.On critical thinking... what I feel is that 1. We were ruled by British. We first awed them. Then were made to awe them.Kings and people wanted to ape them in dress  food everything. Some were forced. Bottom line we awed them.2. Then we had to strive hard to survive. We saw that fame is an end product of power. See  how that effects the psychology?We like fame. Fame ~= recognition.3. The west was flourishing. West had glamour  richness  and power.
