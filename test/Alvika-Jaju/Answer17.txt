Because even now (I'm unmarried ) I still do follow family traditions and while in a village I dont wear jeans and tees. *sigh* the question mentions boyfriend! Nobody chooses a person like: Before: Mini skirt.After: Wear sarees only.The former go with former girls  latter with latter.On a point raised: Wouldn't I choose and vice versa someone who knows that I'm inbetween completely open person and conservative. Broad minded yes.I'm not a 24*7 saree person but I'm not a mini skirt person either.Why would I choose a Hitler who selects dresses like Koreans choose haircuts if I'm not a Nazi.
