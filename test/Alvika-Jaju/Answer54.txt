Unending energy despite having been on her toes the entire day...just for her loved ones. (My mom)Hurt a woman and she'll endure it for all the love she has till she knows you love her and won't betray her.She can sacrifice her life for her loved ones!When she loves...she puts her all in it.Never take it for granted or push her because she asked for something.3. Teenager's hormones : maybe its pretty simple. Boobs/chest: hard/ wet  Ass: hard/wet. Is it love? Is it crush? Is her or her or the other girl on second row?
