Who doesn't love responses. I do.And it means a LOT for me to being responded.Response is similar to being recognised. Recognised as a person or for something you did.I love being showered with appreciation  response to me (my work personal / professional. No response  I dislike and gradually lose interest in doing it for the Co. Or people). I love knowing that what i did meant something to someone or someones isn't that why we do it? If the people or Co. Doesn't respond I feel like they didn't bother even looking at it or it didn't matter to them.
