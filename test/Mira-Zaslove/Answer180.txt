  The most badass life hack I know is: Anchor high  and don't give up. The more you ask for  the more you get. It's as simple as that. I've seen people get badass salaries  girlfriends  and lives by believing they deserve it. What you get in life isn't really what you deserve  but what you think you deserve. If you look at people who are successful they start by aiming high and by not accepting a low offer. People generally aren't going to give you more than what you ask for. So when people ask what you want  aim high.
