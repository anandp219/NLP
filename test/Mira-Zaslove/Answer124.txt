Don't ramble on for too long. For instance  highlight aspects of your career  interests  accomplishments  education  and / or hobbies that match that of the company and interviewer. Focus on what is directly relevant to the job you are interviewing for and for the person interviewing you. Keep in mind an interview is generally not about how smart you are  or how great of a person you are. It is about your fit for a specific job. Most interviewers don't have long attention spans  so use this time wisely.
