(Source: Facebook) Sanders also picked up a lot of Google traffic  as compared to Clinton. However  I don't view that as meaningful. Hillary Clinton is one of the most recognizable people in America  and she's effectively been running for President for the last decade. We already know all about her husband  her business ventures  and her e-mail servers. Very few people probably feel the need to Google her much anymore.
