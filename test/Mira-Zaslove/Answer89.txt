Check out their profiles and see if they all have anything in common. Did the all go to the same college  or no college at all? Everyone have kids or look to be single? Do they look to be into any sports? Dont let on that youve done all this sleuthing  it could be creepy. For instance  dont say  Oh I saw on Facebook that your cousin has a 2 year old son  so do I. However  I did interview with a candidate who said  I saw on LinkedIn that you moved from Banking to Tech. Why did you make the switch?
