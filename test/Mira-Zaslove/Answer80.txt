Stay away from drama  toxic people  and time zappers. Guard your energy and spirit with everything you have. Surround yourself by positive people who believe in you and what you want to achieve. It is commonly said that you become most like the people you hang around and the the people in your direct environment. Chose your friends  colleagues  and partners based on their ability to lift you up. If someone drags you down  or drains your energy  cut them out. 3. Ask for it Once you've determined exactly what you want  simply ask for it.
