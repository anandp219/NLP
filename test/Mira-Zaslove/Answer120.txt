It's not always clear who added the value. More hours don't necessarily mean more productivity. Running a sales team isn't just about sales and achieving sales numbers. There is a lot more to sales management than meeting quota. Being a good sales manager is also about recruiting  training and promoting people-- skills not necessarily inherent to a good salesperson. For example  when I was a new manager  and someone on my team began giving me suggestions on what I could do differently  initially I went back to my more traditional sales mentality and worried that we were still in competition.
