Ask broad questions  and let the interview talk. Don't ever cut off your interviewer. You'll often get the best information when the interviewer's guard is down. A few questions you can ask to determine the culture:1. What surprised you when you joined the company? Don't ask anything specific  just leave the question open-ended  and see what the interviewer comes back with. It will give you good insight. If the interviewer doesn't say anything related to company culture  and instead says something generic like  "I'm surprised the market is growing so quickly " then ask specifically: what surprised you about the company culture?
