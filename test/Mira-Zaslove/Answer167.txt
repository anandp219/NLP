2. When you are dealing with someone who doesn't respond to anything else.There are people who don't respond to anything less. I've dealt with these types of people  and tried to reason with them  and tried to be nice. Compassion did not work. The nicer and more reasonable I was  the more they took advantage of me  and worse  continued to think they could trample all over me. These people will respect you only when you are ruthless. To them  compassion looks like weakness and they only respond to unbridled shows of strength.
