I once worked with a talented  but overly optimistic engineering manager. They gave deadlines that were "best case scenario" and never panned out. Product was constantly late  and ship dates were never met. This hurt everyone. The investors were continually disappointed  and it impacted morale.It was really frustrating for everyone because no matter how impressive the final product  the team was always scrambling and "delivering late" in the eyes of the investors. 3. If your weakness is hurting other people  work on it.
