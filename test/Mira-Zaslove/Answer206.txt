Don't talk badly about these people behind their back  it usually gets back to them  and will create drama. All of this will zap your energy  and leave you with much less patience for everything else in your life. 2. Release expectationsDon't expect too much from other people. Everyone reacts differently to situations  and you never know what the other person is thinking. It's easy to get impatient by assuming other people can read your mind. Don't do it. Also just because you do things a certain way  don't expect other people to do things the way you do.
