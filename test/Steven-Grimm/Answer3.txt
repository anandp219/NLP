  Of course they do. Even if Facebook use during working hours were forbidden  which as far as I know it isn't  Google doesn't get to dictate what its employees do in their spare time  and given Facebook's popularity  it is inevitable that many employees have family and friends who are on Facebook but not any other social networks. Few potential employees would be willing to give up talking to their relatives online just because it meant using a product that competes with one of their new company's many products.Also  a lot of Facebook employees have Google+ accounts.
