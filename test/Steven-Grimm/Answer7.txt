  Taipei  the city  is the capital of Taiwan  so it's part of Taiwan.What the question asker might be wondering about  though  is that there's something called "Chinese Taipei" that competes in the Olympics and other international sporting events. For all intents and purposes  it's the same as Taiwan.The name is used for political reasons. The official position of both the People's Republic of China (aka "China") and the Republic of China (aka "Taiwan") is that the island of Taiwan is a province of China that's currently governed by a different political entity than the mainland is.
