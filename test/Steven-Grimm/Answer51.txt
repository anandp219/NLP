  Flashcards are a useful supplementary tool  but they need to be secondary to other techniques such as regular conversation and writing practice and regular reading of texts in your language of choice. As long as you're focused mostly on those other things  flashcards (especially software flashcards with a good spaced repetition algorithm) can boost your retention to a modest degree.One reason flashcards don't work well as a primary learning tool is that no language is a carbon copy of your native language with the vocabulary switched to an alternate set of words.
