If there's a big enough population of people from wherever you're from  you'll even have a good support network and a lot of business resources available to you  not to mention a pool of potential customers for your food.This is not unique to Chinese people. A couple blocks from my house there's a Lebanese restaurant owned by a family from Lebanon. It's pretty easy to find Italian restaurants opened by Italian people. Your local authentic sushi joint? Probably opened by a Japanese person. Visit London and you'll find all sorts of Indian restaurants with owners from India.
