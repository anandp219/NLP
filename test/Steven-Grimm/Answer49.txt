  If illegal drug use isn't something you're willing to give up while you're staying in a foreign country  Beijing (and China in general) is not the best place to live. People do drugs there  of course  but unlike some other countries  you can't rely on the local officials turning a blind eye because you're an expat. While you're unlikely to be executed for using  that's a possibility  and at minimum you're likely to serve prison time and/or be permanently barred from reentering the country after they deport you.
