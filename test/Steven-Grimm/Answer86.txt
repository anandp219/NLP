And of course there is plenty of street food to choose from; a couple of the side streets off of Huanghe Road near Liaoning Normal University have an especially large number of vendors at night  as does the area just north of Labor Park near the New Mart shopping mall.As is probably obvious from my answer  I'm more partial to the original part of the city on the southern side of Dalian Bay than to the Jinzhou area; it has more character in my opinion.
