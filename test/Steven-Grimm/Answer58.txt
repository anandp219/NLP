Anyone who believes they can always pick out the writing of a non-native speaker because they've seen lots of obvious examples of non-native-speaker text is falling victim to a common fallacy called denying the antecedent:If there are mistakes a native speaker wouldn't make  the writer learned English as a second language.There are no mistakes a native speaker wouldn't make.Therefore  the writer did not learn English as a second language.#3 does not follow from #1 and #2.The only viable basis of an unqualified  blanket "yes" answer -- as opposed to a "most of the time" answer -- is to believe that it is literally impossible for any non-native speaker to ever write the exact same piece of text a native speaker would have written.
