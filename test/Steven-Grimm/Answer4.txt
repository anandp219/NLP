  Yes  because it reduces my ability to make use of Quora's social features. Being anonymous cripples Quora a little bit for everyone else.If a question or answer is good  I may want to follow you in the hopes you'll continue to write things I find interesting.If a question or answer is awful  I may want to mute you to stop you from reducing the average quality of my Quora feed in the future.When you're anonymous  I can't do either thing  so you've made Quora less functional for me  and I dislike people making Quora less functional for me.That said  the inability to follow and mute is not a property of anonymity per se.
