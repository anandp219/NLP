(Going nuts over design patterns seems to be more common in some countries than in others  but it happens everywhere. )Here's the deal with design patterns that is probably not obvious to someone who has learned them as if they are first principles in software development. They are observations  not rules. People noticed that programmers seemed to be approaching problems in similar ways in a bunch of different applications  and they decided that it would be pretty useful to be able to talk about those approaches using a common vocabulary so they wouldn't have to keep explaining what they were referring to.
