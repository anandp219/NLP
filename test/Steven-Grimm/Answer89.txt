  Probably not. One reason is that many characters have more than one pronunciation  so you'd have to either choose just one (which would mean either flat-out not listing the others or having multiple glyphs for the same Chinese character  which in turn would mean you could no longer use any of the standard Chinese encoding systems to locate characters in your font) or list them all and use such tiny pinyin that it'd be basically unreadable. For example  the character  can be read xng  hng  hng  hng  or heng depending on context  and it's not a matter of  "One normal pronunciation and a bunch of obscure ones you wouldn't have to learn."
