  My vote goes to Donek. (click here for the web site)They don't make the most  but the finest brands rarely do. They cater to people who know exactly what characteristics they want in a snowboard  and they make will make your board to your specifications. Length  width  sidecut  stiffness  nose and tail height and shape  even the graphics can be done to order if you like. Prior and Coiler also make boards to order  and are both highly regarded. I haven't tried anything from Prior yet. I've had two custom boards from Coiler and while they rode wonderfully  my Doneks have lasted longer.
