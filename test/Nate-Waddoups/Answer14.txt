Again there is little opportunity for anyone to charge a premium  because there are so many people offering the same set of services.So if you want to make a living printing models  you'd best have an exceptional passion for it  else you won't stand out from all of the other folks who are doing the same thing.--What other options exist for careers in 3D printing? I don't know.It's a fun hobby  so don't hesitate to get involved. But I expect to see few people make a good deal of money from any aspect of it.
