If he is not trustworthy  this is obviously the best thing to do. But even if he is trustworthy  ending the relationship might still be the right choice  since both you you will be better off in a relationship where there is trust. So  think hard about whether you really should trust him or not. If you don't  or for some reason you can't  the relationship is not going to be a good one.
