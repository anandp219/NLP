Which  again  makes it a commodity business. Like photography  modeling is something that a lot of people will do for fun and a barely-sustainable amount of money. Like photography  people who are exceptionally good at it will probably always be able to make a living doing exceptionally high-quality work very quickly  but like photography there will be hordes of people eager to compete on price  making it hard to make a good living.So if you want to make a living making models  you'd best have an exceptional passion for it  else you won't stand out from all of the other folks who are doing the same thing.Marketplaces: Thingiverse has a great place to advertise a share models.
