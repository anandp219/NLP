On the other hand  it is very common to put small  lightweight  low-power cameras on drones  but software that can create a model of the surrounding  suitable for use by navigation algorithms  is hard to come by. There are still PhD-level projects in progress to develop better sensors and better software.If the regulatory questions are resolved  I'd expect to see more funding put into these sorts of things  so solutions may not be far off. But until obstacle-avoidance is fully automated  drones will be limited to controlled environments and/or human-assisted operation.
