Now you have a new problem  but at least you'll both understand where the disagreement is. Maybe he'll disagree with you about whats' going on. That could be a bad sign  but it could also mean that you are actually the one who is mistaken about what's going on. It happens to all of us from time to time. But again  at least you'll understand where the two of you disagree.Since you're concerned that he's lying  it seems likely to me that you have other reasons for not trusting him. In that case  it might be best to just end the relationship.
