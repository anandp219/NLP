  I have been writing on Quora for a year. I am the same dumb/intelligent/mediocre person as I used to be a year back.Though I have noticed increment in perception  vocabulary and knowledge about varied topics.To answer your question  Are the girls on Quora more intelligent than the girls who don't use it?No  girls/boys/women/men on Quora are not more intelligent than the people who are not at Quora.Quorans are subset of knowledgeable people in the world.Can it be true that one's intelligence can be known by their profile and answers?Big  no.
