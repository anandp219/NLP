  The draft isn't totally ended in the US - under the Selective Service System  male US residents between 18 and 25 (Registration - How the U.S. Draft Works) are required to register.Legally if you don't register you can be jailed and fined but in reality you lose a lot of government benefits.That said  the nature of activism is that one is always focused on what is wrong or problematic  rather than what has been done.For example  the UK has been rated the best place in Europe to be gay (UK is 'best place in Europe' to be gay)  and Europe in turn is surely the best continent to be gay.
