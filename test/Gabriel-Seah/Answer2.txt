It is quite shameful for a site to be delisted  and the idea is to deter sites from being substantially affected by development (or some other human intervention) so UNESCO gives warnings before delisting a site.The removal of the murals looks to be at least partly a political issue as they first came up during the 2011-2014 term of the previous mayor Susana Villaran (a rival to the current one Luis Castaneda) (Lima's mayor confesses to cover-up of downtown murals).UNESCO does not seem to have condemned the murals or threatened Lima with being removed from the list and has even said they do not interfere (unless there is "imminent risk" to cultural heritage; Lima murals: Not part of mission of Unesco to inferfere).In my evaluation  it is doubtful that if there were many murals  the character of the Historic Centre of Lima might be affected unless the murals  say  covered the facades of historic buildings like the Torre Tagle palace (which I find very unlikely).
