  East siders are forever going on about how awesome the East of Singapore is.They talk about there being more character  charm and history (and good food! )  that it's less crowded than the rest of Singapore and how Easterners are nicer people and all that jazz. Some Easterners even make derisive comments about Easterners dressing better. (It seems to me that in the East  MRT access is poorer and parking is harder to find  though I do agree there're more indie and non-chain outlets though. There's also more Peranakan (Straits Chinese) influence there.
