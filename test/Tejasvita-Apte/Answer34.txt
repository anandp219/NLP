  Having seen my share of heart breaks and pain  I often wonder  is love worth it? I wonder this immediately after the heart break. Haha.. Never after that. So  here we all are  trying to look for that one person who will rescue us  be our lover  best friend  spouse  care-taker  confidante  all in one! Why is it that adults around the world feel the need to have a companion? It is certainly very basic of human desires. One of course is to reproduce and to pass on our genes. But the other  more important one (or the one I wish to focus on) is companionship.
