  Whistleblower Protection Act is a toothless legislation. The law was passed following a lot of activism. The Law Commission of India in 2001 had drafted a Bill on this issue . In 2004  in response to a petition filed after the infamous murder of Satyendra Dubey  the Supreme Court directed that machinery be put in place for acting on complaints from whistleblowers till a law is enacted. The government notified a resolution in 2004 that gave the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) the power to act on complaints from whistleblowers.
