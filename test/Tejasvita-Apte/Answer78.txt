Another perspective needs to be developed.Same is the case with classical music. The most practicable method to do so is to take a plunge. Listen. Listen a lot. Listen to different styles (gharanas). Listen to vocals and instrumentals. Listen to different raagas and listen to the same raagas again and again. Listen to thumri (semi classical)  Dhrupad (A different and older style of classical singing.) and Khyal (contemporary classical music). Start with Drut (fast tempo) or even fusion if you like that better.
