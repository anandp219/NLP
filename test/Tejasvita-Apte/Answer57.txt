  I have a fairy good memory but no. Synesthesia has nothing to do with memory. I associate a visual with every sound. (Not necessarily just a colour with names). Other than that my chances of remembering a person's name are similar to any other person with a decent memory. I am extremely auditory and the element of sound seems to impact me much more than other people.My musical memory is quite good. I am easily able to sing in 14-15 languages. This is because I listen to music regardless of the language and remember the notes very easily.
