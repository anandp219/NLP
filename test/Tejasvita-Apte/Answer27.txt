  Mooting is what will really make you understand the law. Law and its application are very different things. Never leave an opportunity to moot. Whether to do it or not is still your choice but if you ask me is mooting important  I'd say very. VERY! Having said that  let me tell you how. Moot is where you will come across a legal problem. When you prepare for law exams  all you do is study the law and caselaws. Mooting gives you a taste of the application of law. Study of law is peculiar in a way.
