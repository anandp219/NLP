People assist you. Very rarely people forget me. More so if they speak with me. People (men) have readily helped me out when I have had any issue. That is probably a perk of being a young girl too. I can't be sure. But I have experienced men readily helping me out when I was in distress than say a young boy. The world is quite unfair in the sense that it is simply nicer to good looking people. I have been very conscious of never taking undue advantage of this fact. Other than that  I don't see anything much.
