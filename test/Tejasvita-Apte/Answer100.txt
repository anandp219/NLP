Even today when we can  I see girls not taking decisions for themselves because that comes with consequences. It is easier to allow someone else to decide for you and not take responsibility. As an added benefit  you can also later blame them if it doesn't work out and gain sympathy for being helpless while in reality it is learned helplessness. Every abused woman who chooses to still remain in the abuser - victim pattern is doing exactly this. Not embracing freedom because it comes with responsibility.
