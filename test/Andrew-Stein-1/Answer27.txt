  You may need someone to help you with this  but one idea is to try to implement some form of temptation bundling. This is the idea of tying a pleasurable activity together with a an activity you are prone to avoid. The catch is that you only let yourself enjoy the fun activity when you are doing the not-so-fun one. For example  let's say you are a huge Game of Thrones fan. Make a rule that you can only watch the show when you are on the treadmill. (This is where it helps to have a second person to enforce the rule.)
