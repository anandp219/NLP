Mostly accuracy was sacrificed for the plot and to keep the movie simple and entertaining. However  it is a very interesting thought experiment  how to design a metaphor that accurately captures brain function according to our best current knowledge. I do hope the movie motivates people to think about brain function  but I fear it will increase some poor brain metaphors in the public consciousness.
