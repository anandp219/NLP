  I've never heard this expression before reading the question. In my work I often deal with copyright issues including of stills (ie photos) and video. I think I can say with some confidence it's not a phrase commonly used - if at all - in the UK.I wonder if plagiarism could potentially mean something different to straightforward copying? I see it as a word with a slightly broader meaning.If I see an awesome photo by an amazing photographer and take my own camera to the same location and try to recreate essentially the same image  that is not copying  but perhaps it could be regarded as artistic plagiarism?
