  Not a jot - on the face of it. The United Kingdom has "no selfish economic or strategic interest" (a policy position announced in 1990 and unchanged since then) in Northern Ireland  and the cost of the Exchequer of maintaining Northern Ireland's place in the Union (while significant for NI) is peanuts to the HM Treasury.There would continue to be freedom of movement between the UK and the Republic of Ireland (which would now obviously include NI).But there would need to be a sea-change in public opinion in Northern Ireland to drive the province into the reluctant arms of its southern neighbour.
