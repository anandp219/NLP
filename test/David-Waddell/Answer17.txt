  IMHO  she can lose the nomination  and I would consider betting on that if the odds were good enough. But in all probability she will win the nomination if she plays her cards carefully. That's the primary challenge  literally  winning the primary contest.Traditionally  it's understood that US presidential nominations are won on the left or right  before the general election is fought on the centre ground. Hillary  through sheer force of inevitability  has managed to avoid a messy battle for the leftist primary support  but needs to remember that not a single vote has yet been cast.
