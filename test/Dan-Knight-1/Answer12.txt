The word no becomes more frequent  tantrums are intense. All attention has to be on him  whether its at home or in public. The toilet is always a gajillion miles away. A good nights sleep is worth a gold star and here we hit the crux of the question like a pair of poo filled pants to the face:Sleep.Or lack thereof. I know its part of parenthood  I know it cant be helped  but the early mornings are something I seriously struggle with. I work as a chef  sometimes not finishing until 10:30pm  its natural for me to awake late into the evening.
