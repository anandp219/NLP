The repetitive sitar based loop adds structure to the encompassing lunacy  whilst the rhythm was reportedly provided by Jon Brookes (sadly deceased) from the band The Charlatans which and adds a juxtaposition to the straight up techno of prior tracks (RE: It Doesn't Matter). This gives the track a "band" atmosphere and aids the songs mission. Dig Your Own Hole offers a serotonin-tweaking rush common to all great rock 'n' roll  but wraps it in technological inventiveness that separates it from its big beat counterparts.
