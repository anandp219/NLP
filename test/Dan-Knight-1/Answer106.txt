  *Contains spoilers*Brazil (1985) has some of the best dream sequences. They provide a welcome juxtaposition to the harrowing  dystopian  bureaucratic  retro-futuristic world created by Terry Gilliam.The film follows Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce)  a low level clerk for the Ministry Of Information. He lives within a society under complete control of a somewhat incompetent government.The only way Sam can escape the dystopic nightmarish society is via his unconscious and its exactly that which helps the viewer to understand the film.The opening sequence is perhaps everyone's dream: To fly.
