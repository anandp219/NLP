  I was done by 28 too. I had run huge budgets  profit centres and new country offices I opened for the large corporate firm I worked for then. So I understand how you feel. Here is what I did. A review of your own life's possibilities will yield different pathways for you. Diversified work by diversifying clients - I did a third of my work in academic research  a third with non profits  a third with corporate clients (later adding regulators and policy makers and politicians who influence and make policy to the list); Developed new skills through stretch at work and through going to graduate school again while continuing to work - I got my second Master's and a PhD both of which helped me build better networks  new clients and new lines of work  now also with investors.
