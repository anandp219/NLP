  Very unlikely. "The personal is political"  wrote Carol Hanisch. Daily choices we make are a reflection of our personal politics. Opposing views can and often do cause clashes in quotidian matters. Our political views can and do shape our lives significantly eg a racist person may not have friends of another race while a non-racist may do; now imagine them being married and the latter bringing around all their friends! For instance  a conservative person may have a belief in old fashioned gendered roles and hence division of labour  while a liberal person may see the relationship as more of an equal partnership with both persons doing their bit in the house and at work for their personal growth.
