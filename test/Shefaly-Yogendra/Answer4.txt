As a child I moved once from the city I had lived in for a decade to another and resented the loss of my friends  my neighbours  my familiarity with public transport and directions  and oddly enough landmarks and historical buildings I had scarcely paid attention to. But as an adult I moved often and of my own volition. And my experience from childhood helped me design my own experience each time I moved to a new place. Identify and map your context. Are you a student? Well you have a readymade context of your department  your school and your university.
