  "Do I piss you off?" I can answer this because I recently asked a long-standing friend (think over 20 years and counting) this very question. The likelihood of an answer or an honest answer depends on your friendship's strength and duration. My friend's answer was simple and honest. He said that my standard mode was "always-on" and high energy  and that I was always ready for an intellectual discussion  but he has not always felt up to the task. He added that some people may find it hard -- "be pissed off" -- to deal with constantly being asked to raise their game  be engaged  be their scintillating best.
