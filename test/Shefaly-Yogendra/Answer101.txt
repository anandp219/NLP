One gentleman has spent 5 decades in private equity and needs virtually no introduction. Another has amassed such deep experience of PSU and NGO sectors that he is turning away work constantly. One has worked as a Bay Area lawyer for over 30 years  covering many sectors in defence  tech and biotech  and nothing passes her by. None of them uses social networks  or has a web footprint where random people can find them. They do however use technology but as their slave not their master. Experience acquired over 30+ years of meaningful work is not easily reduced to soundbites or words that may pass "keyword" filters.
