Hang out with diverse groups  attend random talks in new spaces  see historical and artistic artefacts  go to a pub or cafe alone and chitchat with them. All this will give you a lot of choice  which isn't a bad thing for a lonely foreigner! You can now start to commit time to a few choice activities over others. Your repeat appearance will help you make new acquaintances and find a sense of belonging and direction. Finding one or both helps feel less like a foreigner which is the primary source of the loneliness you are experiencing.
