Setting aside for now the idea that somehow an 18yo is all grown-up and able to make serious adult decisions  when his or her brain is still developing the most important capabilities  we return to why kids are cruel. Given their brain development  kids operate mainly on basic impulses and on a fairly basic idea of survival. Add to this the environment the kid is growing up in  and some impulses may be sharpened or dulled. A child growing up in a traumatising environment of abuse and violence and inattentive caregivers  will probably have a highly attuned danger sensor  and some of them may have a self preservation streak that may look cruel to an adult's eyes.
