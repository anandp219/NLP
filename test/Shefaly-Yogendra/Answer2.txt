Some of the best - informative  eye opening  prejudice slaying  bias bashing - answers here come from people  who are from cultures where English is not the main language. This helps us all learn. Asking for a "certain level of English" is also an expensive and tricky feature to implement. I have on occasion edited answers written by native speakers* too. Who will determine the level? Who will test it? What is the incremental gain to the community for all the resources expended on this exercise?
