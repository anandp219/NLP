  Breakfast is usually a bowl of granola and cold milk  sometimes followed by a banana. When I get bored of that I have buttered toast with Roses lemon and lime marmalade instead.Lunch is normally taken at my office but I try to plan ahead and make something at home to take with me. I aim to make a salad at least twice a week and at the moment that consists of chopped romaine lettuce  celery  a sliced red apple  a sliced fresh chilli  walnuts and blue cheese  sprinkled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.
