Otherwise we do a chicken stir fry or a pasta meal; Thai prawn curry is another favourite or maybe grilled tuna steak with fries and peppers.I don't think there's anything particularly unusual about that menu. British cuisine is very international these days but perhaps there is more bread and cheese than in some other places. One thing that might set me apart is that I don't drink tea and never have done  I just drink water all day.
