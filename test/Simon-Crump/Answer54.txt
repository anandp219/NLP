  I enjoy Peter Hawkins' writing and find it very instructive. Peter's PPE from Oxford trumps my degree in Industrial Economics from Birmingham on matters of political philosophy and I've learnt a great deal from reading his answers.I don't want to speak for Peter here but I think one difference may be in our approach to utilitarianism. Peter is fairly clear in his rejection of utilitarianism and has opined that any policy which results in a worse outcome for a single individual  even if it improves the outcome for everyone else  is morally inferior.
