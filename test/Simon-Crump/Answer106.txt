Post-IR35  it is unlikely that you will be expected to set up your own company and so you are likely to be paid as a self-employed individual  which in theory means you have fewer employment rights. Even that isn't the end of it though  as more recent legislation extends employment rights to contractors if they have worked for the same company for a certain length of time.All income tax and NI are subtracted from employee's wages before you are paid  so if you are an employee you do not need to keep any money aside to meet your tax bill.
