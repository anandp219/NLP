  In my company  everyone does some software development and exactly half the people on the payroll are 45 or over. It's nice to have the experience associated with people who learnt their trade doing things the hard way.When I worked for a larger company I found that there were indeed far more younger programmers. I put that down to the rigid pay and management structures there  which encouraged ambitious people to try and get promoted beyond their level of competence. Most of the older programmers were contractors who had checked out of the corporate game and just wanted the biggest buck for their bang.As in most employment scenarios  it's nice to have a mix of youth and experience.
