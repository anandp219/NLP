  I don't have a plan. Nor do I have a plan for what to do if the interest rate on my mortgage went up to 30%  what to do if I'm attacked by a rutting stag while cycling through my local park  or what to do if I am diagnosed with a terminal illness tomorrow. All these things might happen but they are quite unlikely and I don't need to screw up the rest of my life planning for them.Violent home invasions are an overstated threat because the overwhelming majority of people who might break into your house would prefer to do it when you are not there.
