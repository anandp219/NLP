Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little face of the children  whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my Faith forever. Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence which deprived me  for all eternity  of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things  even if I am condemned to life as long as God Himself.
