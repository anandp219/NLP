  We've all had those days when we feel like the world is conspiring to keep us down  as if we're in jello or some sticky substance that holds us back from getting things done. Those days when things break down- when the toast gets burnt at breakfast  or we spill our coffee on our report. Maybe it's one of those days that we are in a fight with a loved one  or someone takes it out on us. A stranger on the subway yells at you. From there on  it seems it's one calamity after another.On days when things don't go our way  we can feel like we're in a bad movie- like life has its own agenda for us which is to cause things that don't normally dysfunction  to do so with full force.It's days like those that we might believe we have no access to choice or even free will.
