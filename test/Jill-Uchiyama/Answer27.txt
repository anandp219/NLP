It requires trust and honesty about one's life. Discretion is important  and there is a time and place to share something that may be difficult  or very personal. But one would hope he/she could share most anything.In this way  a couple will become closer and more intimate over time and though they may not know everything about each other  they won't be intentionally holding on to certain aspects of their lives that they are unwilling to share.
