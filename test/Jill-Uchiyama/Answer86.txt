Let me explain.Being the most important person means many things. It means that you get to be the creator of your own life. It means that you get to be limitless  that you choose to see yourself that way- regardless of struggles. Above all else  it means that you get to put into motion a life that is meaningful  rich  loving  beautiful and generous. You get to generate something. Not only for yourself- but for others too. This is how you leave your signature on the world. Being a special person to yourself- first and foremost- is what will make you shine like a diamond in this world.
