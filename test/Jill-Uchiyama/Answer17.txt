  When you really are meditating  you are in a timeless state. That is why many people who are deeply resting in a meditative place can sit for potentially hours and not know it.Because time is non-existent in the deepest place of letting go  there is no attachment or bondage to the minutes and hours. That is how many who have gone off the grid to meditate somewhere for years on end are able to do this. It is a powerful place.If you are sleeping  that is something different. You also lose a sense of time when you are asleep  but it is important not to confuse this with the meditative state.
