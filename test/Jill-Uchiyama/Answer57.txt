  Even if people say they don't believe in ghosts  they would probably not want to get anywhere near a so-called haunted locale. Some people who say they don't believe in anything supernatural  paranormal  or even spiritual  are actually terrified of anything that is not logical or rationally based. Most people are easily spooked and that sensation does not come from the logical part of the brain. A friend of mine  Gerard Senehi  used to do shows for people that would scare the hell out of them.
