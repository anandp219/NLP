This  I felt was an important effect of reading Night. I came to believe that if I could not be heartbroken by this story  then  wouldn't history surely repeat itself? And so  as one of the famous quotes in the story reaches me and so so many people who read it  I was surprised and glad to see it encrypted on the walls of the Holocaust Museum in Washington  D.C. And as the melody of this quote lives deeply in myself and all who read it  may we never forget either.Never shall I forget that night  the first night in camp  which has turned my life into one long night  seven times cursed and seven times sealed.
