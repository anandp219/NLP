The reminder abilities are endless. And I can add new reminders to my Inbox without having to pin anything as well  replacing my habit of emailing myself when I'm on the go to remind myself to do things... Now I set Reminders.And finally this is where bundling has saved my life. Inbox allows me to bundle everything related into a single group  so whenever a new message comes in that goes into the group  all email messages in that group jump to the top of my inbox because it's chronological! This allows me to quickly see new actionable items without having to scroll  or dig through things that are arbitrarily classified as Important.
