All the motion is constrained to the [math]xy[/math]-plane. Just thinking about it  the center of the dipole moment should be moving in a U-shaped (hemispherical) path back and forth  while the dipole is spinning about the center of the dipole moment due to the torque applied. The magnetic field does not change the orientation of the dipole  but shifts the center around  so the dipole in the electric field will appear to be spinning in its rest frame normally  the addition of the magnetic field adds a new rest frame.
