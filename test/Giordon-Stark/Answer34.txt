A ROOT file is like a database  and it contains lots of TDirectories and TTrees. A TTree is like a database table. A TDirectory is like a collection of database tables. A TTree can have TBranches/TLeaves which are like columns. And the rows are the events. Here is a code example to illustrate some basic structure: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011kratsg@connect:~/faxbox/LArStudies$ root -b -l PileupSkim_Pythia8_AU2CT10_jetjet_JZ0W_0.root root [0] Attaching file PileupSkim_Pythia8_AU2CT10_jetjet_JZ0W_0.root as _file0...root [1] .lsTFile**		PileupSkim_Pythia8_AU2CT10_jetjet_JZ0W_0.root	 TFile*		PileupSkim_Pythia8_AU2CT10_jetjet_JZ0W_0.root	 KEY: TTree	mytree;1	mytreeroot [2] mytree->ls()OBJ: TTree	mytree	mytree : 0 at: 0x1dc2430root [3] mytree(class TTree*)0x1dc2430Notice how it tells me that the TTree mytree is located in memory at 0x1dc2430.
