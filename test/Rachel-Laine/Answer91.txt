This should not be your goal in befriending a few individuals  of course. The friendships should be the goal in and of themselves. Remember that while it's often important to be a part of the group for political reasons at work or school  it's more important to be friends with people that we truly enjoy being friends with and enrich our lives. When you do join this social group please extend a dinner invite to the next newcomer to your class. I'm sure they will appreciate it.
