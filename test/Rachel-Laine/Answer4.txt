  I am not at all offended if someone forgets my name. Similarly  I'm not troubled at all when people call me Rachelle or Rebecca and I have to gently correct them. This happens a lot  actually. So why do some people work so hard to remember and match names to faces? I think that there are a lot of situations in which it communicates to people that you care or respect them or  maybe more importantly  don't care so much or respect them. There is a whole lot communicated in the few seconds of an initial greeting.
