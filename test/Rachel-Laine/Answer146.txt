Win-win-win. I volunteered at a blood bank when I was in high school and I loved it because the people were fantastic and I made a few friends all while doing something that I thought was important. Plus  there was a super adorable tech that I had a pretty big crush on (understatement). Protip: Leave the stuff about the adorable tech off of your college app should you desire to be admitted.You said that you are interested in music. Have you ever thought about taking group lessons? Guitar  drums  whatever it is that you are into?
