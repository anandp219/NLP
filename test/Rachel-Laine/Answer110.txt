When I want to create something  I really focus on being mindful of how much energy the creative process takes and that I can't spend my energy on friends or elsewhere. This is a very key part of my creating process. Some might call this "hermit mode". I will probably always be jealous of the uber-cool creative types who make it all look so easy. But until I can morph into one of these creative superheros  I will continue using my creative process hacks for the not-so-creatively-inclined.
