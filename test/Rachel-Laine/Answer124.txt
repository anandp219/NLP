It happens to the best of us  and it's also why I took the easy way out and had a teeny  tiny wedding with no attendants.My friendships have definitely changed over time. They have changed with marriages or babies or school or moves or jobs. I suspect that they will continue to change. This isn't a bad thing  I don't think  but it does take some adjusting. And change is hard for me. Adjusting to this change was most difficult for me in my mid- to late-20's. All of my friends were getting married and starting families and their new families were now the main focus of their time and energy and attention as opposed to their friendships and social lives.
