I let out a heavy  exasperated sigh and listened to her through my almost-tears. She knew that I was social and loved having fun and being with friends  but that fun to me was a great conversation  or game  or interesting movie - a different kind of "fun" than my peers enjoyed at this age. I sniffled as she explained to me that I am an "old soul" which she said means that I have a richer understanding of the world and greater maturity than many of my peers do. That I am wise beyond my years. While I understood intellectually what my mother was telling me  it didn't quite fit with what I was feeling  and so I was more confused than comforted.
