  I never imagined that I would walk down the aisle to holy matrimony with a programmer. Sure  my parents were programmers and owned a tech startup  but I thought that world just wasn't for me. I was filled with passion and was impulsive and had an adventurous and slightly mischievous streak a mile wide. But more importantly  I hated sci fi  role playing games  Japanese anime  and I have never seen the Star Wars movies (please  dear readers  refrain from downvoting because I have not seen Star Wars).
