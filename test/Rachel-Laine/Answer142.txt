While loving every single aspect of your job isn't a realistic requirement  I think it's important to take a careful  honest inventory of your strengths and weaknesses  what is a source of energy for you and what drains your energy  the type of environment and people you work well with  and so forth. "Communications" encompasses *a lot* of jobs. Just in PR  for example  there are very specialized jobs that focus on things like writing or media training to broader  generalist positions.
