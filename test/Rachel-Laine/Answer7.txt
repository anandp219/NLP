If you just had 10 more IQ points  you could go to a better college and get a better job. If you were just 10 centimeters taller  you could kill it at sports and command more respect at your job. There are countless "somethings" that people torture themselves over and women bemoaning their physical features is one more something. While almost none of the somethings that we subject ourselves to are going to make our lives more wonderful  some women might imagine that having a more petite nose  for example  might somehow make her more glamorous and her life more fabulous or that having perfect skin will make her life easier.
