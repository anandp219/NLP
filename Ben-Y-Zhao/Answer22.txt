 Ben Y. ZhaoHonestly, I doubt many professors remember their first lecture, unless it was especially good or bad. I think my first lecture was teaching CS170, Undergraduate Operating Systems, a fairly tough course (maybe the toughest in the major at UCSB) with a massive amount of theory and coding projects to go along with it.While I don't remember my first lecture, I do remember that I made a huge screwup that quarter. I emailed the PDFs of the final exam to the TAs, because I had to be out of town attending SOSP in San Francisco during finals week. I even told the class that I won't be in town for the final, but the TAs will be there. What I forgot was I did not tell the TAs they needed to administer the exam.So the morning of the finals, I get a panicked call on my cell in SF from our department manager asking me where I was. Apparently the TAs showed up, and just sat in the room waiting for me, even as the students told them I was away and asked for the final exam. So I drive back to SB in a panic, but it was obviously too late. We had to effectively cancel the final and make a makeup exam, which had to be optional (because it was outside of the regular exam time). I think that was probably the single most embarrassing thing I've ever done as a professor. Luckily the students didn't mind that much. Unbeknownst to me, one of the students in that class would stay for the MS program (with me), decide to work with me on his PhD, and end up being one of my best students. Christo Wilson is now a tenure track assistant professor at Northeastern University (Christo Wilson). Only when he was about to finish his PhD did he tell me he was one of the students in my inaugural class at UCSB, and we had a chuckle.
