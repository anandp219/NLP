 Ben Y. ZhaoIt varies highly depending on the discipline. For the social sciences and especially for the humanities, it is incredibly difficult. I don't know those disciplines well so I won't opine on them. For engineering departments, the steps generally look something like the following:1. Get PhD from great department or group, produce exceptional research along the way, generally documented as papers in the top venues in the area (either conferences for CS or journals for EE and hard sciences). 2. Do a postdoc with a productive group and further build up your CV and publications (this is often optional for top candidates in computer science)3. Apply for faculty position, generally by submitting CV, a research statement, 4+ letters of recommendation, a statement of teaching, and some representative publications. 4. Get invite for onsite interview/visit. Visit department, give fantastic talk on her research, impress future colleagues in lots of one on one meetings.5. Get (hopefully multiple) faculty job offers, weigh the pros and cons of each, do second visits for the departments with the best offers, negotiate with the top choice for teaching relief, startup package, lab space, and salary.6. Accept offer.7. Go on vacation (or if you're super competitive or worried about getting a head start, go off to travel and recruit graduate students).
