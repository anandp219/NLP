 Ben Y. ZhaoHonestly, who knows?Am I happy to see UCSB jump up in rankings? Of course. It's great, not only for the students, their families, but also the great faculty and staff who work their asses off to make this the best university possible.But let's get some perspective...This is one of the most well-known and popular yet completely baseless rankings out there. It is far more driven by reputation than any statistics. Even "statistics" that it proudly advertises are generally useless/misleading. Graduation rate, that's a really critical metric for gauging how great a school is, right? You'd think so, until you realize that graduation rate is far more an indicator of the quality of the student body itself. I'm guessing more students at a lowly ranked state school will tend to drop out than students who got into Yale/Harvard/MIT, because a) they're likely overachievers, b) they're far more valued and watched over by the universities who want to stay ranked #1, c) they have parents/families who spend endless years and resources trying to get them into these schools and keep them there.So a difference of 2-3 spots in a ranking like this, driven largely by reputation and self-fulfilling statistics? Let's just say I'm not going to brag about this to my UCSD colleagues next time I see them at a conference. :P
