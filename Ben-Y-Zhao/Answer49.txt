 Ben Y. ZhaoA2A. What Shriram said....Beyond that, you have clearly not been "reviewing" the right papers.For example, have you read the SOSP Xen paper from Cambridge (Xen and the art of virtualization), which introduced hypervisors (along w/ the Denali work from UW)? That design enabled cloud computing as we know it today, and runs in every cloud from Amazon to Google to MSFT to ...Have you read the PageRank paper at WWW from Stanford? The one that spawned a little company called Google, which now does much of the industry research you're referring to.Have you read the Consistent hashing paper from MIT that led to the founding of Akamai, the CDN that touches 80+% of all internet traffic today?Or maybe any of the RISC or RAID papers from Berkeley, papers that started multiple industries each with 10+Billion dollars in revenue?I'm not even touching the new companies that are changing the future of computing as we know it, everything from Nicira to Databricks. And by the way, this is just in the areas of systems and networking, not including security, theory, architecture, etc.
