 Ben Y. ZhaoYou don't. By definition those papers are meant to be kept private during the review process. It is entirely possible for you to be scooped by a paper that's under review when you submit your paper.However, most program committees take this into account, and would not penalize you or compare you to a paper that was not yet published at the time of your paper submission deadline.EDIT: Reading Shriram's excellent answer reminds me of a very educational experience I had. Roughly 2 years into my assistant professor job, I was attending a top conference in systems/networking, and listening to a presentation that sounded exceedingly similar in idea to a top paper published 3-4 years ago at another premier networking conference. The previous paper was led by a great Berkeley faculty member on my thesis committee.Puzzled, I fired off an email to him during the talk, and asked what he thought of this current work (of course he would be aware of it). His response was gracious and enlightening. He responded via email (I'm paraphrasing), and I'm pretty sure he would have had a smile on his face if he said it in person:"Ben, your job as a young faculty member, is to never publish a paper that could lead an audience member to ask the question that you're asking me now."Like I said, gracious and enlightening. :-)
