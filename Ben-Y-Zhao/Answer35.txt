 Ben Y. ZhaoIt's hard to say...On one hand, I can tell you that most of the top research faculty I know didn't change anything when they got tenure. If you're good at what you do, tenure is a formality you go through, and should never have been the primary goal in the first place. For those top faculty, pre-tenure and post-tenure life is pretty much exactly the same. You probably get a raise and a little weight somewhere is lifted, but it really doesn't change anything about what you do day to day.For the students who work with these faculty, it really makes no difference. The pressure to produce research is equally HIGH, because the really driven post-tenure faculty member is equally as driven after tenure. So the students are expected to produce just as before.On the other hand, numbers matter, i.e. the number of students in the lab matters. Pre-tenure faculty tend to have smaller groups. So being one of 2 or 3 students working with the professor pre-tenure, vs. being one of 6-7 students in an established larger lab, that makes a difference. The pressure and expectations might be equally high, but the scrutiny might be lower, because it'll be distributed across more students.Finally, I will note that not all faculty are like this. It depends a lot on the caliber of the department. I do know faculty who basically went on varying degrees of "cruise control" when they got tenure. For those faculty, tenure does indeed mark a significant change in their life. So my suggestion: you want to work with those faculty who work exactly the same (or harder) post-tenure as they did pre-tenure.
