 Ben Y. ZhaoYou're right. There are ways an unscrupulous employer could take down your number, by sneaking in a pen, a voice recorder, or just memorization. But I think you're missing the big picture. Credit cards today are not secure, period. There was much easier ways to steal your number. Every time you give your card to a restaurant waiter, they can make a copy of your card before swiping it for the actual transaction. Your numbers are also in constant danger from leakage and compromise while stored in financial databases at banks, hotels, insurance companies, and anyone else you've given the number to. What "protects" you are two things: law of large numbers (the probability of thieves targeting you out of the millions vulnerable is quite low) and credit/identity theft monitoring services. It helps that you can complain to the credit card company and get most illegal charges dropped. This is of course getting better now with the U.S. finally updating its credit cards to the pin and chip types that Europe has used for years. Still, that doesn't address the problem in all scenarios. Constant vigilance is the only solution, unfortunately.
