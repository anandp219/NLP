 Ben Y. ZhaoIt's a story I've told most of my graduate students.Up until my last year at Berkeley, I didn't know whether I was going into academia or a research lab. I thought I didn't want industry, so didn't apply to any companies. Google's people pursued me (this was pre-IPO and they weren't as "hot" as they are now), so I did an onsite. They gave me a job offer with X,000 shares of options, which I totally underestimated the value of, because I thought their stock would be worth $50/share. Ooops. They gave me a weird clause in the offer that if I went on the academic job market, I'd still have their job offer, but the stock options are gone. I declined.I interviewed with a few labs (HP, IBM, MSR Cambridge, MSR Silicon Valley) and a few schools. MSR Cambridge is where I have lots of friends, and it was the first step on my interview tour. Loved the people, loved the place, and MSRC was likely the lab I would go to if I were to go to a lab. So I'm sitting in my friend's office and chit-chatting after the interviews, and he's telling me about his week, and how he's going to talk to his manager on Friday. Somehow, that comment stuck with me. The idea that I would have a boss who could tell me what to do, just felt wrong. That's when I decided I was going to academia. I can't handle reporting to any one else, and outside of starting my own startup, this is probably the only job where that will never happen.
