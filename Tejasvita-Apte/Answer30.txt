 Tejasvita ApteWell, it's complicated. In the sense that the legal position is not very clear. You will not be affected by religion if you don't let yourself be. You are allowed to not follow any religion (or follow) and you are allowed to convert into another by choice. You are allowed to marry under the Special Marriage Act if you are not inclined to have a religious wedding. The problem comes in succession. Adoption. If you are a Hindu, you are governed by the Hindu Adoption and maintenance Act. If you are a Muslim, you cannot adopt unless you follow the specific set of conditions. Muslim women cannot adopt a child.If you are a Hindu and if you wish to make a will, you cannot give away your ancestral property. You can do what you want with your self acquired one. If you are a Muslim, you cannot give away more than 1/3rd of your property by will anyway. In case you die without making a will (intestate succession), the devolution of your property will take place based on your religion. So, if you are a Hindu, Hindu succession Act will apply. The only option for you if you do not want to these laws to apply to you is to convert into another religion in which case the laws of that religion would apply. There is no 'default law' or Uniform civil code that would apply to you without inquiring into your religion. So, legally, you cannot be an Atheist. But nobody will bother you if you don't believe in a religion. You can choose to not be associated, but in certain matters, the law would apply. High time the current government at least shows some spine and get a Uniform Civil Code and be done with religious laws. One law for every Indian.
