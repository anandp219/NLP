 Tejasvita ApteMooting is what will really make you understand the law. Law and its application are very different things. Never leave an opportunity to moot. Whether to do it or not is still your choice but if you ask me is mooting important, I'd say very. VERY! Having said that, let me tell you how. Moot is where you will come across a legal problem. When you prepare for law exams, all you do is study the law and caselaws. Mooting gives you a taste of the application of law. Study of law is peculiar in a way. In the sense that the purpose of law is to regulate. The aim of a lawyer is to interpret the law and find a loophole in it. This is how law gets developed. All of this cannot happen if you cannot think as to how you can argue that will bring forth the loophole!Mooting does it for a student. It gives you an opportunity to study and actually apply the law. Argue it and convince another person about it. Lastly, it's the most fun thing a law student can do. Enjoy it. Learn from it. :)
