 Tejasvita ApteLet me first begin by quoting two philosophers who I am sure do a better job of condensing my answer in as few words as possible. Thoreau says - "To be a philosopher, is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live, according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust."And Bacon says - "Seek ye first the good things of the mind, and the rest will either be supplied or its loss will not be felt."Philosophy is the best adventure human mind is capable of! The need of philosophy is often questioned (by some) simply because Philosophy takes the arduous task of seeking answers to the unanswerable Questions. Science (I would call it a daughter of philosophy), tries to figure out the "Hows" and the "Whats" of the world. Philosophy tries to seek answers to the 'Whys'. Most often they are unanswerable. Till science finds a way of figuring out some of them. For at one point of time, what is inside the moon was also a matter of philosophy before we reached the moon! Even then, science can answer the "what" and the "How". But not the Why!For this one reason, philosophy always treads a very dangerous path. Because the whys are abound. And it is very easy to go astray in the world of thoughts. Which is why it may seem like Philosophy is always losing ground. But that is the price Philosophy has to pay in her pursuit of asking and seeking answers to the unanswerable questions. Philosophy is the art of thinking. Deriving meaning and pleasure from the experiences of the world. It is the very nature of humans to philosophize. To wonder. To be curious. To ask 'Why'. This wonder, so very basic to our mind, is philosophy. Do we not need it? Babies would disagree with you! So would philosophers!For more on philosophy, psychology, life, thinking and mindfulness, follow my blog - Mindful musings
