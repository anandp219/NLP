 Tejasvita ApteI think the wisdom of Godfather doesn't come from any theory or thought. (Much as I would like to theorize about it!). It comes from action. From being in that situation where 'you've got to do what you've got to do!'A person who once struggled for food is going to have a very different outlook towards life than a person who doesn't even know what it is like to struggle for food. A person who hasn't eaten anything for days isn't going to think it is unethical to steal. This was with reference to Don Corleone. Don comes to America as an immigrant and builds his way up. He knows what it feels like to not have food. His ethics and his morals are very different from others. Similar situation is that of Michael when he very reluctantly enters the family business. He does what he has to do. He does what he can do best when he is pushed to a corner. I don't think there is much philosophy or wisdom there in Godfather except the fact that what you become depends on the choices you make. And both the father and the son are very clear about it. They own it up.
