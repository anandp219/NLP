 Tejasvita ApteI don't know what 'should' be done. Frankly, that word always puts me off! I always tread very carefully when people start talking about 'shoulds'!I am more interested in inquiring into the reasons of the fixation with 'should' than the 'should'. But my OCD aside, here's what I think! Personal opinion - 'You've got to do what you've got to do whether you want it or not'Plain and simple. Know that even in situations you feel helpless in, where you think you have no choice, you are still making a choice. Maybe the choice is between bad and worse, but it is still a choice. So, whatever you feel, helpless or not, you've got to do what you've got to do. And face the full consequences of that. You cannot choose the consequences. I take a lot of inspiration from Michael Corleone from the Godfather. I like him for this very reason. He never wanted to get into the 'family business'. But when he does, he makes a choice and takes the full consequences. He knows 'wants' don't always materialize. Similar is the situation in Mahabharata. Where a lot of characters make hard choices, but they do what they believe needs to be done. And take the consequences. Like I said - You've got to do what you've got to do. Lastly, life doesn't present itself exactly as we want. It is random and it is indifferent to us. It is upon us to find our meaning. To do. And to react. That is in our hands. Or so I'd like to believe! For more such answers and posts, follow my blog - Mindful musings
