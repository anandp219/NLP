 Tejasvita ApteI was invited because of my contribution on Quora. :) Thank you, Quora!I nominated a few people. Well, the experience was amazing. I enjoy public speaking. I was invited to give the talk in SRM university, Chennai. The theme was 'Breaking Stereotypes". I chose to give an action plan. The audience was super cool. They were with me all along. After the event we got to interact and it was extremely pleasant. I met some very interesting people and was happy to answer a lot of questions the students had. One of my most prized compliments came from a 13 year old who was there with her mom. She told me she understood everything and loved the talk. I was very happy to receive a call from her on my birthday! SRM university organizers and other speakers felt like a mini-family! To this day, I am in touch with them. After the event, I was happy to even sing! One of my special talents is singing in different languages. I sang in about 6-7 languages and was happy to get a space where I could! Any change in me after that? Not so much really. I am the same. Except a beautiful experience richer! A handful of memories wiser! :) I probably need to speak a little slow I am told though! LOL. So, if I am invited a second time, I'll try and do that! Thank you for the ATA.
