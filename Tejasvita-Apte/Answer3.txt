 Tejasvita ApteCritical thinking is the ability to think with neutral perspective, the ability to look at the situation, reason with it and come to a logical and rational conclusion. (Concluding is optional!) It involves looking the things with clarity. For without clarity, there cannot be critical analysis. The difference critical thinking makes in our life is this - To know this difference too, you need some amount of critical thinking. (Recent insight!)There is no point talking more about the advantages of critical thinking. I believe they are fairly clear and known. The important question is, how do we develop this ability. Critical thinking requires experience, practice and a lot of contemplation. I know a very nice Sanskrit term which can greatly help in learning to develop critical thinking. That term is - 'Saakshi bhaav'This means developing the point of view of a 'witness'. Removing yourself from the situation and looking at things. Creating the distance. I know (from personal, first hand experience) this is easier said than done. But I also believe that with understanding, contemplating, introspecting and practice, we can try and develop this. Here's what I have found useful practically -  Not clinging to any beliefs too tightly! - You can cling. You may be convinced about something. You may have strong opinions. Fair enough. Just keep in mind that they can be wrong! Be open to be proved wrong!If you are open to be proved wrong, you can look at any new proposition with an open mind. Examine it from every angle. Analyse. If you think it is worth considering and changing your existing notions for, you will go ahead. If not, you can dismiss it. In either case, you have nothing to lose! Once you don't cling to any belief, you are open. You are receptive. And you begin to analyze everything critically. Removing yourself from the situation.
