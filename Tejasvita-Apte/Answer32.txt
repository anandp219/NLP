Because you cannot have a running race when the starting point itself for the participants is different. If that is the case, then you need to first get the other runners to the base line by carrying them in vehicles (Affirmative action) and then they can compete. Remember this has nothing to do with inherent weakness. I support only one kind of reservation for women. (Or minorities, or SCs and STs, or anyone else). Reservation of representation in the Parliament. Because we cannot make laws for women without their representation. (Same would apply to minorities, SCs and STs)This was affirmative action in practice. The last part is difference in treatment that is expected which people often confuse as antagonist to their idea of equality. Can you really treat children and old people as one? Can you treat men and women as the same? Equality is not Sameness. Equality is equal treatment of the equals. So, maternity relief granted to women is a special law only for women because they are not the same as men.When women ask for equality, it is equality of opportunity. That is all. Men and women are equal. Not the same. Do not confuse between the two.For more of these, you can follow my blog - Mindful musings
