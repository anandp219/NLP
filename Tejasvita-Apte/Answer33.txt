 Tejasvita ApteHaving seen my share of heart breaks and pain, I often wonder, is love worth it? I wonder this immediately after the heart break. Haha.. Never after that. So, here we all are, trying to look for that one person who will rescue us, be our lover, best friend, spouse, care-taker, confidante, all in one! Why is it that adults around the world feel the need to have a companion? It is certainly very basic of human desires. One of course is to reproduce and to pass on our genes. But the other, more important one (or the one I wish to focus on) is companionship. The desire to be heard. The desire to be known. To be accepted for what we are. To be loved despite all that. To express that love physically. Sex is one part. The other more important psychological and emotional need is to be loved through our bodies. To experience intimacy. Emotional and physical intimacy. In love, we expose ourselves fully. The best and the worst. We all have demons and we all want to be loved despite our demons. Love is this essential challenge to our need to feel secure! We experience two simultaneous pulls. One to be safe and secure, while the other is to fully expose ourselves and be vulnerable. Love therefore, takes courage. It mandates that we leave our secure shore, let our defenses down and take a plunge! The most essential need we all have is - 'To matter to someone'. In love, that is felt deeply. In heart breaks, that is what gets hit. But when you have seen and truly felt love, regardless of the heartbreaks, the person will always matter. And love will always feel worth it. Now, go find love. Experience it. Enjoy it. And thank it. :)
