 Gayle Laakmann McDowellNo.There are many reasons why unplanned pregnancies happen. Lack of access to contraception.Contraception failing.Rape and/or abuse.Being told that you're infertile.Using contraception incorrectly.In addition, there are reasons why someone might want an abortion, even in a planned pregnancy (for example, fetal and maternal issues).These things happen, but let's be honest. The number one reason for an unplanned pregnancy that leads to an abortion is just people being irresponsible by not using contraception and then deciding they don't want kids.Should they be able to access abortions, despite their stupidity? Why on earth not?Pregnancy is hard -- really hard. It sucks even when you want to have a kid, and I can't imagine how much worse it'd be if you don't want to. Raising a child (or giving up a child up for adoption) is even harder. These are not reasonable "punishments" for a couple's irresponsibility. I don't want to force a woman to go through pregnancy and then adoption/child-raising just because she was irresponsible.In fact, do you really want the woman who was repeatedly irresponsible and doesn't want a baby to be forced to raise a child?
