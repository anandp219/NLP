 Gayle Laakmann McDowellWhile I understand where you're coming from, no, it's not re-writing history. In fact, it'd be frankly weird to not update the pronouns. This is essentially how we handle everything else. People say "Gayle McDowell worked at Google". But McDowell is my married name, and I was "Gayle Laakmann" the entire time I was at Google.Someone might say "I met my husband at my friend's 25th birthday party," but at the time he wasn't her/his husband. Names and pronouns are just "pointers" to the person. They typically reflect the current name and pronoun, not the name or pronoun at the time. I am not inherently Gayle McDowell; I am me and people happen to refer to me as Gayle McDowell.Convention is to use the current pointer, not the then-pointer (probably because the pointer is designed to be useful, and using an out-of-date one isn't so useful). It'd be quite strange to break from convention specifically to use a transgender person's "original" sex.Additionally, for many transgender people, their original name/pronoun reflects a painful time in their life. They might not want to be reminding of this time themselves. They might also not want to "out" themselves to others.Given that convention is to use the original pointer and the pain it would cause to not, it seems pretty evident that we should use the current pronoun.Of course, if a specific transgender person has a different preference, go with that. Even if it doesn't fit the "standard." This impacts them far more than you.
