 Gayle Laakmann McDowellI typically vote as a democrat. More specifically:I lean much more strongly democrat on most social issues (gay rights, transgender rights, black and minority rights, women's rights, gun rights, healthcare, immigration, religious involvement in politics, assisted suicide, etc).I think the increasing disparity between the wealthy and poor is problematic. I'm concerned about the shrinking middle class. Democrats seem more focused on this issue. I somewhat side with republicans on some economic ideas (for example, the value of being fiscally conservative), but I don't think they have actually executed effectively on this.While democrats have elected their share of stupid people, Republicans seem to take the cake here. Their adherence to religion probably has something to do with it. (This is not at all saying that religious people are stupid. It's that screaming the loudest about God seems to be a winning strategy for Republicans. That's taking the focus off more important things, like good decision making.)To put this another way: I'm somewhat torn between the two sides. I could be willing to go against my values and vote republican if there were very strong evidence that Republicans were better for the economy (after all, the economy also has life and death impact for people). But that evidence isn't there yet, and thus I would generally vote democrat.
