 Gayle Laakmann McDowellMany people do tell friends and family their name choice at first -- and then they learn their lesson. Revealing the name in advance can only hurt them. I generally avoid doing things that will only hurt me and won't help me; don't you?Look, if I tell you my favorite name, one of a few things will happen:You'll tell me that you love the name. Whew! But nothing's changed now. I don't really like the name any more than I did before, nor have you influenced me. I'm glad that you like it, but this wasn't really a value-add exchange of information.You'll tell me that it's too {common, unusual, hard to spell, easily confused with another name, black, WASPy, hispanic, old-fashioned, trendy}. Um, okay... so you don't like my name choice because it's unusual, but that's part of why I like it. Again, no value-add, but it was value-subtract. Now I know you don't like the name.You'll tell me that you don't like it because that one jerk you know has the same name. That is obviously meaningless in terms of the general quality of the name, but it's still a value-subtract. Now I know you don't like the name.In other words, your opinion is basically worthless. Your criteria are either stupid or different than mine. So let's review. If I tell you the name I've picked, I walk into one of two scenarios:Best case: no change / mild relief. Worst case: walking around with the knowledge that you don't like my baby's name -- and possibly even turning me off the name enough that I need to choose a new name.It's a no-brainer: Keep the name a secret. Only tell those you know will happily lie about how much they like the name.After the baby is born, people are considerably more tactful because, hey, what's done is done. They realize it's harmful to say they don't like the name. So they stay quiet and, often, eventually come to like the name.Note: If someone tells you their name picks, the correct response is "I love it!"
