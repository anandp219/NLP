 Jeff LeeYou are not alone, and I think that 99.9% of humans suffer from hidden fears, and fewer than 5% probably ever overcome. Merely looking puts you in a rare and advanced group. It is important however, to long term happiness and peace of mind because the True and the false cannot occupy our mind simultaneously, therefore getting rid of fears, all of which are false beliefs, is an important step. Meditation is the right technique, but it could take a long time to do without a sense of direction. One method would be to unlearn everything that the ego ever taught you, but that is a lot of work, too. My favorite method is the Six Steps to Freedom, a practice devised by Diederik Wolsak, of Choose Again, using a practice based in the teachings and methods established by Dr. Jerry Jampolsky's Attitudinal Healing Centers. It is a practice that uses feelings and memory to drill brown to your earliest remembered trauma associated with a particular problem, and then come to terms with why that belief was not true and release it through an alternative forgiveness practice. The Six Steps can be obtained from http://www.gracecounselingkc.com...Alternatively, you could watch one of Diederik's one hour You Tube videos. But, having the above pamphlet handy is recommended.
