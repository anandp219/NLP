 Jeff LeeYou dont, you get down from a duck. Oh, that was supposed to be in response to, "how do you get down from an elephant?" It is similar...you ask the wrong question, you get the wrong answer. If you never send a text in your life, you will be communicating much more succesfully, like 100% of the planet did up until the time you were born. I could explain for days and days what is wrong with texting, but I would be boring those over 40 who are very aware that it is the worst form of communication other than, one fart for yes, two farts for no. You could smile at her, you could ask her for coffee face to face, you could write her a hand written note, you could type her a letter if you truly have cause to say a lot. The key is relevance. If it is simply to say, I think you have pretty eyes, do not waste your time, she will think you are a dangerously unbalanced stalker or emotionally, a twelve year old, sort of what someone would think if they received a text from a virtual stranger. If you want to bump into her, find a way to do it. By the time you get out of high school, you are supposed to have observed sufficient interactions with the opposite sex as to understand what is considered cute versus weird, adult versus prepubescent, sexy & romantic vs unconfident & stumbling, and if you haven't, you probably spent too much time on computer games or texting and need to dig up some Humphrey Bogart or even Charlie Chan movies. Women have changed their hairstyles and clothes since the 40's, but their idea of appropriate and romantic are ideals that have not changed in many decades.
