 Jeff LeeNo, not by any rational definition of an organization in the aggregate. Compared to a host of countries where kickbacks are the norm, we are probably one-thousandth as corrupt. Compared to Russia, where people of wealth and power truly own politicians, and benefit greatly, our system of competitive bidding, OAG Audits, and sunshine laws make us probably only one-hundredth as corrupt. If you are talking about hypocrisy of journalistic control and manipulation of, and threats to, all government employees to violate ethics, there are countries in the Middle East and Africa that would score 95 on corruption, whereas I would place the US federal government at 0. A free press, whistle blower laws, the mindset of American values, and checks and balances between branches of government, make it virtually impossible for a dictator to act or hide behind persons he has threatened or blackmailed into compliance.If you are talking about small scale individual corruption whereby a person acts for personal gain: a congressman votes against his conscience in order to get donations from a group so that he gets reelected; a judge takes a bribe to decide a case in favor of a millionaire; a military purchasing agent dummies up the bid or shares confidential information in order for their favorite aerospace contractor to get an award; yes, there are a few corrupt individuals, but probably less than one-half of one percent, an unavoidable result of the human condition, and the system determines them guilty and prosecutes when discovered, therefore one would not say that the system is corrupt. Such things are far more common at city, county, and state government levels where there does not exist as robust an infrastructure of internal control systems and well-funded and independent monitoring departments. If you are talking about too much money in politics and the appearance of conflict of interest, yes, each party has been guilty of catering to their own special interest groups, however, one could argue that it is merely representative democracy where an individual's dollars rather than votes, are the determinant of majority opinion, and would could reasonably argue that it is a necessary, beneficial and effective system. However, there are no checks against excesses, therefore I think there is a better way. It may not be a weakness that one would call systemic corruption, merely a need for fine-tuning.
