 Jeff LeeI am sure my parents attempted to drill it into me as a child, but I am sure I successfully ignored them until my corpus collosum successfully knitted together at age 25, and I stopped totalling cars at least once per year. At that point, I did have to say, behavior is on me. I changed it and haven't totalled a car since. But really, I don't know if I truly accepted responsibility for all my actions, until I took responsibility for my thoughts. I think it took another quarter of a century for me to start observing my thoughts sufficiently to accept responsibility for the thought behind the thought, and the thought, belief or conditioned response behind even that thought. Self honesty to that degree required diligent effort to be vigilant, ask the right questions, look for ego lies by asking deeper questions regarding beliefs, values, fears, prejudices, to the extent that I felt I could no longer ignore who I really was, deep within. In recognizing the truth of the following loop:What I think (believe), I see. (In this case "see" means perceive.)What I see, I experience.What I experience, I think (believe).(Return to step 1).I was able to change my beliefs or to deliberately change my experience, and in so doing, I took responsibility for my core thoughts, even beliefs formed from childhood trauma. I healed the fears and changed my thoughts. In so doing I accepted total responsibility for my entire existence as well as every future thought and action. The mind can be an ugly place, but you don't have to in alone. A therapist might be advisable, or good spiritual underpinnings from a solid psychological framework, such as Byron Katie, ACIM, Regina Dawn Akers, Francis Bennett, or Adyashanti.I highly recommend it for all!
