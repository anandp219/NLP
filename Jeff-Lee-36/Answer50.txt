 Jeff LeeChristians are divided because there is almost no subject in which everyone can agree, but in this case as with all things religious, there is a wide disparity of knowledge of the Bible amongst different factions. The people who have what I consider hateful views are well intentioned, they simply don't know better. There are many fundamentalists in America that have never read more than 15% of the Bible and think certain Shakespeare quotes are from the Bible, have never considered the errors introduced due to major language changes that occur over hundreds and thousands of years, think significant portions of the Old Testament are from the New Testament, think that God dictated the entire book to one person, think the earth is 5000 years old, don't know that the same passage that they quote from Leviticus would also require they be stoned for mixing wool and cotton outfits, or for eating shrimp. Their ministers are barely informed better, whereas the priests in mainline religions not only have far more intensive education, their leaders retained their knowledge of what the church did to selectively edit and eliminate gnostic writings, and know that most of the Old Testament consists of Babylonian myths and fairy tales. It is similar to racists. Virtually no person would call himself a racist, but most of us absolutely know a dozen people whose narrow mindedness, lack of introspection, ego domination, poor education, and anger-hormone linked thought processes lead them to be obsessed about defending their grandfather's point of view despite having never had any experience or knowledge for the racially charged subjects that they hold such strong and extreme opinions.
