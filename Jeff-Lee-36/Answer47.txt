 Jeff LeeI have never noticed who wrote the question I choose to answer. I think most of them are anonymous. I generally only answer a question I feel I know something about or I feel that I can help the OP, or if the question already has many answers, I only respond if I can add something to the discussion that is not already mentioned. There are some questions that I absolutely will not answer: those that appear to be written by angry trolls, those that are too ungramatical to know exactly what is being asked, most questions containing assumptions, and questions which are longer than 25 words or have more than three paragraphs of background explanation. I am also not inclined to answer questions written by 14 year olds, as they typically respond with long angry and insulting rants when you don't tell them what they want to hear. Then there is that silly group of, "what should I do?" that is probably both by a 14 year old and is impossible to answer because there is insufficient information, we can't tell the person how to be happy, and, they probably wouldn't listen, anyway.
