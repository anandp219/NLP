 Jeff LeeI abhor a bare wall, so much so that when I couldn't figure out what to put between the top of my 6 foot entertainment center and the 14 foot ceiling, I placed a nine foot dogwood tree branch, (I live in the woods on Dogwood Estates Lane, so, it makes sense). I did have to glue on fake dogwood blossoms to pull off the effect. You didn't mention the mission of the organization, but you should get your inspiration from that. If it were a deaf interpeting agency, you could draw hands in motion; if an independent living center, silhouettes of people using walkers & wheelchairs; if a theater group, masks of the two Greek muses; if a commerce and growth association, photographs of existing bridges and easily identified local architecture, large maps, and architectural renderings of future projects, even ones that were canceled, if a federated fund raising organization, a collage of the names of its member agencies. To do this on the cheap, you may have to draw, as large photo enlargements and their frames, can be expensive. Local university art students may be willing to volunteer to execute an idea. In fact, artists are generally creative people and may offer an idea that is very fitting to the mission, catches the eye, makes you think, and is easy to pull off on a grand scale. With that much height, you may want to bring the plain wall portion down by reserving the top foot or two to a stenciled inspirational phrase that defines the oeganization, "building progress through people;" "only education can pave the road to the future;" "providing shelter to those between homes;" or something that is a quote of your founder or is contained in your mission or vision statement.
