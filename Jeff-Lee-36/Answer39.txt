 Jeff LeeThere is obviously more than one or two reasons for changes in anything. Expectedly, Advaita Vedanta has more than a few reasons for growth in popularity in the West:The impossibility of Abrahamic religions to stand the test of reason by the ever growing educated and scientifically minded world of the West.The growth of American New-Thought churches and philosophers from 1870-1930, including Christian Science, Science of Mind, Unity Church, and Church of Divine Science, etc.An attraction to Advaita Vedanta by agnostics and some atheists, combined with the somewhat mistaken belief of some followers to think that because Advaita Vedanta is non-Abrahamic, that it is nontheistic, (Oneness is still theism within certain paradigms).The tendency of truth to grow over time, and that great truths exist in nondualism, and Advaita Vedanta is more palatable to the West than Buddhism.Quantum mechanics, although not truly justifying nondualism, had some proponents in the 1950's who explained it in terms of justifying a belief in the world as illusion, and some used this to consider radical new versions of spiritual thought. Transcendental Meditation influence due to The Beatles affiliation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the 1960's brought many people to better understand the spiritual benefits of meditation, self-awareness, and an interest in the source of these teachings.Popularity of Insight and EST and Findhorn and other self-help and self-awareness groups in the 1970's opened the door for many disaffected persons to find greater meaning in philosophy, perceptions, science than they found in traditional religions.The publication of A Course In Miracles, in 1975, which taught a Christian version of a nondualism, whereby all is One and all persons true spiritual selves are essentially God.The popularity of The Secret and its conflating with the Law of Attraction made for interesting questions by New Age followers relative to nondualistic paradigms, opening the door to read more and to seek explanations either in science or religion.
