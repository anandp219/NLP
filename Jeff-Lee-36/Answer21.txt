 Jeff LeeI took the same flight at the same gate at the same time every Friday from Reagan National to St. Louis for several months. I recall hearing something about an equipment change on the PA, so when I noticed I was on a Boeing 737 instead of an MD 80, I wasn't surprised. As we were speeding up down the tarmac at 200 mph, I hear the attendant mention the expected touchdown for New York City and I think the attendant has had a long day and is confused, until I notice the people nearby are not looking aghast or amused. I see the flight number on the boarding pass of the person nearby and realize it would be a long night, wondering if I will miss the last flight of the day from New York to St. Louis, and what would happen to my luggage when I am not there to pick it up. I barely made it home that night. The airline was apologetic for letting me make the mistake and there was no charge. I felt stupid for not paying more attention. It is something that I don't think I would ever let happen again.
