 Jeff LeeDepends on what you mean by DNA. If you mean chromosome used in reproduction, no. If you mean RNA/DNA chains in neurons, yes. All thought, all intercommunication within the brain, whether to sense limbs and muscles, regulate temperature/hormones/etc, send conscious or unconscious messages to limbs/organs/muscles, or to manipulate memories into subconcious or concious thought involves sufficiently organized electro-chemical pathways to function. Because parts of the brain toward the inner core are more protected from damage done by certain strokes or blood bleeds in the outer higher sections, but speech requires not only the pathway to the nerves and muscles of the tongue, but multiple pathways within the memory sections, and sufficient pathways in the areas where higher thought can be cognized. These last two sets of pathways frequently require left/right hemisphere coordination due to the number of cells and neurons and locations for speech, therefore you have tripled the probability of temporary inability for the team of neurons to coordinate correctly. A bunch of blind alleys when the speaker is "looking for" letters, words, meanings, concepts, tongue shapes, reasoning, history, names, places, feelings, values, all at the same time. It would be like pouring molasses on a spider web.
