 Jeff LeeLeave her be and move on with your life. Not every relationship, even marriage, is healthy if it lasts longer than the people involved can continue to find benefit, love, and growth. Some people should never have gotten together to begin with and even one person realizing this can the best thing that could happen. You didn't provide much detail, not that it truly matters. It is obvious that she was very hurt and very convinced that you are not going to truly change. Be honest, have you changed? Or, have you just become regretful and are looking for a "do over?" If you were to be anle to ask her, I doubt that it would make a difference in her decision, because all of the sincere apology you can muster regarding one incident wouldn't matter if there were, in fact, a multitude of little things that speak volumes as to your values, habits, jealousy, judgment against her friends or family, potential for distrust, probability of a recurring pattern of anger, substance abuse, emotional or physical abuse, selfishness, presence of personality disorder, depression, blaming others, victim mentality, inability to cope with normal change, narcissism, BPD, or manic behavior. You obviously think, rightly or wrongly, that having her back would give you joy. But, ask yourself, honestly, if besides the issue in question, you are the best possible thing in her life. If not, then grow from the experience and move on joyfully with great regard for the moments you shared and the things you learned from her. They will be very valuable in your next relationship.
