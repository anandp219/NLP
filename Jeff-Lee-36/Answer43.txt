 Jeff LeeInteresting way of putting it, but perhaps it needs an improved definition, as I see the most profound development that we can do is to spend some time in daily meditation combined with constant vigilance of our thoughts and the intent to see ourselves truly. This doesn't remove bias so much as transform and expand that personal view to be much more inclusive. It does so, first, by making us more honest...if you knew and acknowledged your true motivations and judged them less than honorable, you would change and if you knew the real reason for your prejudices and judgments you would probably transform your thinking to be in alignment with your truest values. So, after spending years in this new honesty machine that you have created in yourself, you are open to all ideas, all justifications. Your openmindedness is now automatic, you make no assumptions about others, except to always assume their best intentions, or that they are merely misinformed rather than meanspirited. You would look at all the options before taking action because it is not only you that you want to satisfy but the needs of others, and you would find joy in all that you do, reaffirming your decision to become and stay self honest, self aware.
