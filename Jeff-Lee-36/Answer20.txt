 Jeff LeeI wouldn't worry about it too much. This may have seemed imoortant and you took it seriously, but if there is no buy in from those being led, there isn't much you can do. Sometimes, when you are liked and respected, a follow-up eye-to-eye conversation asking them for their promise to deliver timely, can acieve better results. I guarantee that if they were getting an evaluation that contributed to whether they got a raise, as is the case in the employed world, they would have been much more responsive to their commitments. Some other things to consider before beating yourself up, people your age can have a tendency to push the edges of authority; young people have a tendency to resent and not respect someone in their peer group being placed in charge; and guys your age will tend to follow the majority or the alpha-male rather than the official authority figure even if it involves punishment. Another relevant factor: seasoned managers have been trying to figure out how to deal with your generation for at least five years. Unlike my parents era, and mine, who give 100% loyalty to every task from an employer or authority figure, the last generation hired are insisting on knowing relevance and acting like they have a right to negotiate their involvement. I hear that the latest crew graduating in the last four years, is even insisting on using Facebook during working hours, taking off for excessive personal time without asking for permission, and other non-compliant behavior. You may have your hands full supervising in the next era.If you want some practice supervising real world situations, with theoretically more motivated people, consider volunteering for a not for profit. After a few weeks of doing tasks that are easily mastered, needed regularly in large numbers, and done by volunteers, you would likely be tasked with being a supervisor of those volunteers.
