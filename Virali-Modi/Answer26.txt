 Virali ModiI believe in solving my own problems. I'm not one to take a shortcut. I believe in hard work and I feel all the current problems I have in my personal life can be sorted out by working hard.There are major problems in the world which I'd like to address.1. Peace between religions. Recently with the Mumbai meat ban due to the holy festival of Paryushan for Jains, there's been a lot of controversy where some Jains feel that their religion is in trouble. I'm Jain too, but I find the meat ban to be ludicrous. Also, people killing other people over religion? 2. Unlimited resources for food and fresh water. I read somewhere on the internet that India (especially) will run out of fresh drinking water by the year 2040. What about other third world countries that don't have enough resources to sustain their population?3. Killing animals for other reasons rather than food. I'm a vegetarian and I don't support animal slaughter and the mistrestment of animals, but that's my personal opinion. More so, I do not support the killing of animals for trophies, for fur, or for ivory. These beautiful and majestic animals are going endangered because people want to mount their heads on a wall, make a fur coat, and want to make money by selling their horns or tusks. I wish there was some way to put a stop to this, once and for all. There are protective measures being taken to protect these animals, but this needs to stop.
