 Virali ModiAre you willing to spend your life with someone who broke your trust? Are you willing to be with someone who won't understand the sensitivity of the situation? Can you be with someone who will mostly make things your fault and will make you feel guilty? Are you willing to let someone control you?Answer these questions. If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, then just apologize and tell him you won't be friends with those guys. Tell him how much you love him.If you answered 'no', be prepared for some harsh words, that might not be pleasant to read. Also, be prepared to have your heart broken.Trust is the making and breaking point in a relationship. Trust is what keeps us glued together. Your boyfriend broke your trust by going through your phone  your personal property. If your boyfriend felt compelled to invade your privacy, that shows how much he truly trusts you. You left your phone with him or near him, that shows how much you trust him. If the feeling is not mutual, then what kind of relationship is there?I'm sure after going through your phone, your boyfriend had questions. Why couldn't he understand the difficult time you were going through? Instead of hearing your side of the story, he started yelling and getting angry. It also seems as if your boyfriend is quite insecure of your friendship with men, according to the details you added.I don't know about you, but if someone can't respect my personal property, my privacy, and my relationship with my friends, then we'd have a problem. Along side of that, I cannot be with someone who doesn't trust me and doesn't try to understand a situation, especially when I didn't know what to do.I'm pretty sure you understand what I'm trying to say. There is no reason for you to apologize, you were not in the wrong. The only thing, that I felt was wrong from your side, is that you should've discussed the messages you exchanged, with your boyfriend.
