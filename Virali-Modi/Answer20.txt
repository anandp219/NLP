 Virali ModiThis is kind of cheesy if I'm being honest, but incredibly sweet!My boyfriend hates when I have chipped nailpolish on my nails or bare nails. He gets irritated when I don't paint them. Well, when he was here in India, he took out my nailpolishes and started going through them. He eventually picked out a pretty fuschia color and told me to paint my nails.I started painting my left hand and after I was done, I tried painting my right hand  I couldn't get it as perfect as the left. My boyfriend sees the struggle on my face and he sits down next to me and snatches the nailpolish away from me.Me - "What are you doing? I was using that!"Dhyaan - "You're struggling. Now keep still!"Me - "Babe, you don't know how to do this! You'll mess it up, I'll manage."Dhyaan - "Will you let me try?"Me - "Okay, good luck!"He stole the nailpolish away and started painting my nails for me. I was in awe with the steadiness of his hand, the perfection that was my nails. My nails never looked so good, it was almost like a professional manicure, if not better.Me - "Where did you learn that?!"Dhyaan - "I'm full of surprises, baby."He then went on to painting my toes, because I couldn't reach (wheelchair problems). I mean, seriously? This man might just be the most perfect thing ever. My painted nails never looked that good! I learned something very important that day; I should never underestimate my boyfriend.Some men might think it's very feminine of him to do that, but it's not. It's called love and care. If you love someone and you see they're struggling with something, you would try to help them as much as possible.
