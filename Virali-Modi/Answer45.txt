 Virali ModiEnjoy the present. Often times, when we look back at our failures and prepare too much for the unknown future, we end up ruining our present.Smile, everyday. Yes, sometimes we have horrible day where we don't want to smile. We feel the world is our enemy. Seriously though, smile. It might not make you feel better, but seeing a smile might make someone else better, especially if they're having a crappy day. A smile is an extremely powerful thing, it can turn someone's day into something positive. Just the thought of that makes me feel powerful. Be thankful for what you have. Most of the time we compare ourselves to someone who's doing better than us, and we feel shitty and jealous. It's not your fault, it's human nature. Sometimes we need to look at people who are begging for their rights, to understand how lucky we truly are. Some people don't have clean water, food, clothes, and/or shelter. Everyday, even for a minute, be thankful for what you have and never take it for granted. That's when you'll truly be satisfied with what you have and the next door neighbor's Porche won't make a difference.Be positive. Being positive everyday is difficult, I'll be the first one to admit it. Trying to be positive, or trying to bring a positive aura into your home or workplace can be life changing. Positivity, happiness, hard work and success all go hand-in-hand, from what I've experienced.Love yourself. At the end of the day, you're stuck in your body. The body that you have is yours and yours only. It's like your home. Why not love it? Let's face it, you only have one body. Hating it, hating your personality, and yourself isn't going to help you whatsoever. Love who you are, love what you do, be passionate about things, have self respect, and stand up for what's right.*There are many, many answers here. I haven't gone through them, and it's quite possible that some of my points have already been listed.
