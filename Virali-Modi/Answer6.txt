 Virali ModiThere really isn't just one answer. The mixture of products and technique can help to achieve a brighter appearance. Products such as illuminators, highlighters, lighter concealers, and setting sprays can help. Techniques such as the highlight and strobing effect can also help.Combining the right products for your skin type with the right technique can make you look glowy, healthy, and bright. You can also look like a disco ball if you overuse products. In achieveing a brighter face, less is always more.Using an illuminating skin cream, under your foundation can make your skin "glow from within". Combining that with a light shade of concealer, usually two shades lighter than your foundation, and applying it under your eyes, the bridge of your nose, and your forehead can make you look bright. If you really want to enhance that glowy, bright look, you can add a highlighter on top of your cheekbones, your brow bone, your chin, your cupid's bow (the arch of your lip), and the bridge of your nose. Like I said earlier, using products in moderation is the key to look "natural". Yes, using that much makeup can make you look natural, if you know how to use the products, how they mix with your skin, the right technique for you, and the right appliances for you. Makeup is something that you have to play around with until you figure out what works for you.
