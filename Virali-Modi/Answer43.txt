 Virali ModiYou're frustrated because you don't see yourself sitting in a cubicle for the rest of your life. You want to do something more, but you feel you're stuck. You mentioned that you want to quit what you're doing, but at the same time you can't because of certain responsibilities, I'm assuming.Do you know that you and I are in a similar situation? I'm also 23, a female, and I'm stuck doing something that I really don't want to do  which is therapy. Do you know what I've come to realize? I have to do physical therapy because it's good for my future. It's good for my health. I decided it was time that I accept the fact that I'm doing therapy for my benefit, even though I despise it. I started doing things differently.During therapy, I listen to music, motivating music, such as EDM or something that's to my liking. I started taking breaks between exercises to message my mom, dad, and my boyfriend. I started asking questions to the therapists about the human body, and gained knowledge. Honestly, I enjoy going to therapy now because I've started taking interest, I started doing things differently, and I started learning. What I'm trying to say is that you don't have to hate what you do. I'm not saying that you're job is going to be permanent. I'm asking you to customize your cubicle (if it's permitted). Do things a little differently, if you're allowed to listen to music (with earphones), do that. If you don't have the freedom to do anything there, then try learning as much as you can, until you're ready to quit your job. The lessons you'll learn there will help you in the future. Love what you do, and do what you love, success isn't far.
