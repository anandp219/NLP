 Virali ModiThere's this quote at my gym, "What doesn't challenge you, doesn't change you." This quote defines who I am. All the challenges I've faced in life has definitely changed me, positively. Whenever I'm faced with a challenge that seems as if it's the end of the world, I make sure I repeat these words. This may not help others, but it surely helps me. It gives me hope that there will be a way out of this.With me, I get too worried about a certain issue that I start to overthink the situation (it runs in the family) and I make the situation seem more bad than it really is. I think most people do this too, they end up thinking the worst outcome possible and start imagining things that (truthfully) won't happen. We become so blinded by our self-created fears, that we fail to think logically and rationally.When I get to the stage of overthinking, I repeat this quote and go to sleep (hey, a nap never hurt anyone, don't judge). When I wake up, I'm usually more logical. I like to think about the situation from a different perspective, while I weigh all my options. That's usually when I'm able to make a decision, depending on the situation.Another quote that always helps:"If you can change it, then don't worry. If you can't, then don't worry." Things always work out for the best, even if you don't want to believe it.
