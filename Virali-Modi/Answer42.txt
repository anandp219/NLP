 Virali ModiI extensively agree with Aarushi. You need to fight your own battles, you can't expect assistance. If it's given, that's wonderful. If it isn't, you need to learn how to cope. You also need to learn what works for you and what doesn't. It's a bit harsh, isn't it? That's how the world works, unfortunately.I also think talking to a psychiatrist is a good option, that Aarushi mentioned. All of us may not have the privacy and finances to see one, which is understandable if you're a student. I'd suggest you find an outlet where you can start venting all that anger, frustration, and sadness into something useful and positive; such as working out at the gym or something creative like paintings or writing stories.Let me share a little secret with you; I have a blog on Quora where I write incredibly dark stories, something you wouldn't EVER imagine me writing. I write stories like those when I'm upset, angry, and frustrated. When I'm finished, I'm left with something beautiful  in a twisted way. Reading my completed stories, I'm always left in awe. My feelings of resentment and anger are gone, and I'm left with something that I'm thoroughly proud of.Look, at the end of the day, you cannot rely on someone to make you feel better. No one should be responsible for your emotions, except yourself. I feel that this sudden loss and grief has been brought upon yourself by you. I feel that you're the only one who can try and change things for the best. If you need to discuss this with your parents, with a doctor, or if you discuss it with yourself on pen and paper, whatever helps. You need to do something to change your life around.I really hope you feel better. I hope you take a decision which you're proud of, and will resolve the situation.
