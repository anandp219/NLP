 Virali ModiMy dad has been in the hotel/motel industry for over 20 years. The experience he has is tremendous and quite outstanding. My dad has won awards for excellent management. For quite some time now, he's been wanting to buy his own hotel but hasn't been able to because something always came up, which stopped him from fulfilling his dreams and aspirations. Despite us being from America, we aren't as rich as people would assume. Yes, my father worked as a manager in many, many hotels and would earn enough to feed the three of us, and we were able to live a lavish life. At the same time, there were instances when we didn't have a roof over our heads, money in our pockets, and food in our stomachs  he worked degrading jobs, according to him, to feed us.I'm not comparing you to my father, rather I want you to understand that planning your future, your dreams, your goals, and your aspirations may not always come true. There are few people who have the luck to plan something and have it work out. You cannot hold on to those dreams and force them to magically become fulfilled. Keep those dreams, goals, and aspirations with you, locked away in a safe, in your heart. Right now, your main focus is to fulfill your responsibilities. How can you fulfill your responsibilities? Right now, how can you survive?When you figure that out and start working towards your responsibilities, and once you're a little steady, you can resume working on your dreams and goals. Rather, you can improve your goals to be more realistic.
