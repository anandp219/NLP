 Virali ModiPresently (and hopefully permanently), I'm dating a guy named Dhyaan. We met on a famous matrimonial website. The funny thing is, when he expressed an interest in me, I declined it because he was from Africa, a non-vegetarian, and (I'm going to sound superficial) because his pictures were horrible. He sent me a friend request on Facebook, along with a message, a couple of days later. At first, I didn't know who he was, we started talking and his exact words were, "I'm the guy from Africa, that you declined." I was feeling horrible. His pictures on Facebook were great, he's built, likes to take care of his health, and is a software engineer.We started talking and well, one thing led to another and we're about to complete two years in November. I visited him in Africa in June, and he came back with me to India and left at the end of July (2015). Yes, we were in a long distance relationship for majority of our relationship, and still are.Why am I sharing this on Quora? I'm positive that this relationship will end in marriage, if not now, then maybe a year later. His family is incredibly supportive and accepting of me. Dhyaan is an amazing person. He's full of life, zest, and the most important thing, he can make me laugh no matter my mood. He's understanding, respects my space, is encouraging, and motivates me to eat healthy.Honestly, he's the reason I started going to the gym. Since I started working out, I've seen more improvements in my physical health. I've become stronger which helps me at therapy. He's supportive of my dreams to be an actor/model, and he's also trying to get into the industry, and by the response he got when he was here, I'm sure you'll see the both of us break into Bollywood.I have nothing but good things to say about this man and his family. He's affected me positively and is always so loving and caring. I cannot put into words how lucky I am to have him by my side.PS. HE LOVES DOGS!
