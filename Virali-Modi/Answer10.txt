 Virali ModiI received this message on my Facebook page. The person who sent this message is a follower on Quora and messaged me to thank me. I've received similar messages from people on Quora, Twitter, and Facebook. I'm always left in awe when I read that I've helped someone fight depression, help them during a bad phase in their life, stopped them from committing suicide, or if I've just made their day a little bit better.Nothing in the world is more amazing than to know that I've changed, inspired, and/or motivated a life. For me, that's the gift of a lifetime. I do a happy little dance when I read such messages and I try my best to reply to every one of them. To be honest, sometimes I get so ecstatic that I go to tell my mom and I forget to reply all together; it's not something that I'm proud to admit, but it's the truth.Thank you Quora for letting me share my stories, experiences, and advice with the world. Thanks to my followers who upvote, comment, share, and message me to let me know that I'm doing a good job. When I'm having a bad day, your comments and messages make it so much better.
