It was was Tom's turn. When he started, the teacher shouted, "No!". So he stopped and started again, when the teacher again thundered, "No!". Tom sat down feeling embarrassed. Now next Kim stood up and started speaking when the teacher again shouted, "No!". But Kim continued and when he was done, the teacher praised him, "Excellent!"So after the class, Tom goes to the teacher and complains, "I started better than Kim and I knew the entire story too." The teacher looks into Tom's eyes smiling, and explains, "Knowing the story is not enough. When I said no, you stopped because you were doubtful. You have to be sure of yourself. The world will keep saying 'No!', but you have to respond saying 'Yes!' and prove them wrong."So this is why confidence is required. Your mind will tell you not to talk to that girl, your friends would advice you that the interview is out of your reach and your peers would warn you that job is just too difficult. Your intelligence and smartness all get locked by 'Ifs', 'Buts' and 100s of doubts in your mind. Confidence is the key that opens the doors, and let intelligence and smartness fly high. Confidence is the fuel of the car, all other things are just its parts - essential, but worthless without the fuel.
