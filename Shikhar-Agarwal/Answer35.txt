 Shikhar AgarwalMummy: Did you have dinner?Me: Yes.Mummy: What did you eat?Me: Only one question related to food!And then she smiles. Everyday, she asks "Did you have dinner" first...I believe Yes gives her the real satisfaction.Before I start my Skype conversation, I change my t-shirt to a particular one.Mummy: Again the same t-shirt! Do you ever bath? How many months have passed by since you have washed your clothes?Me: I just smileAnd then occasionally, I have a different t-shirtMummy: OMG, what happened today? <big, big, smile>If it is my dad who initiates the Skype call:<Skype ringing, then I pick up>Silence...both of us are waiting for other to speak first. He finally lets go saying "bohot achi baat hai!" (great going!) and we both laugh. I think he loves me more than I do.I have 2 little cute teddy's (a lion and a small duck). Occasionally while talking, I would pick these and show them on the camera, zooming in and zooming out, making them dance. They just love it and makes the mood jovial. Occasionally my mother would "feed" them with cookies!And then some random stuff. One day, there was a banana kept on my table. I picked it up, showed on camera, and said, "A mosquito was sitting on it. Is it now safe to eat it?" And my parents just kept on laughing. The other day, my mother showed me the fruit fig. I blurted out, "this onion is so small!" (It looked like it..)Yes, stupidity is good.
