 Shikhar AgarwalOnce there was a general who was leading his army into a battle against an enemy much larger than his own. While going towards the battlefield, they stopped at the local temple to pray for strength and victory.The general held up a coin and told his army, "I am going to request God to help us defeat the enemy. If this coin lands with the head on top, we would win. Else we would lose. Today our fate is in the hands of the God. Let us all pray to Him".They all prayed for a short time and the general then tossed the coin. It landed with its head up. The soldiers were overjoyed. With their spirits high, given that God was on their side, they fought enthusiastically and won as predicted.Later, the soldiers told him, "We were lucky to have God on our side. Only He determines the outcome.".The general took out the coin from his pocket and showed to them. Both the sides were heads.The above story captures the essence of my answer - yes, it is possible. In fact, I believe you always make your own luck.We hear about great discoveries coming out of lucky accidents, people's dreams and so on, but the thing to realize is that these people were not just sitting idle. They were actually working hard in related fields, thinking about the issues 24x7 and perhaps had attempted 1000 other things and failed before they "had a lucky accident" or "got the answer in the dream".So if you want to get lucky, work hard, keep a positive attitude, learn from failures and iterate over them quickly. If you just sit and wait for luck, you would be alone forever. The fact is that luck is waiting for you round the corner, and its upto you how fast you run towards it.
