 Shikhar AgarwalThe simplest strategy to follow would be the following: Anytime you are doing something involving other people, ask yourself - "If others do the same for me, would I like it?" If the answer is no, you are not following dharma.Any action you are performing in general, ask yourself - "If I was earning 10 times less, had a smaller car, was living in half the size of my current house, in short was less fortunate and had a lower so-called social status, would I like that thing to be done?" If no, you are again against your dharma.I wish I could give you a more concrete answer. But if you understand dharma, you would know its not a bunch of mathematical equations or physics formulas. It's not even a prescribed set of rules, for if it was, then a policeman would not overspeed to catch a thief or a soldier would not kill to protect his nation. It is a principal, a philosophy which tells an individual to act righteously and responsibly for the betterment of the society. Man, by nature, is selfish and would not want anything bad for himself. The above strategy would help you do good things for others too. I think these questions would help you find the answer.
