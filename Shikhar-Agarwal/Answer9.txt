 Shikhar AgarwalEver wondered why diamond shines so brilliantly? It shines after it has been cut by friction. Similarly gold cannot be purified without fire. People cannot become successful just by reading motivational books or attending lectures and seminars. They have to experiment, fail, experiment harder, fail harder and go through this cycle again and again. They have to walk miles on foot to save a penny, bear all the criticism and tantrums thrown by the society, and spend sleepless nights on their desks. They have to survive by selling candies and newspapers, washing cars in the neighborhood and delivering pizzas to different homes. They have to fight their close ones, and have to walk on a road less taken leaving their comfort zone behind.The above things are essential to succeed. Why? Because they give valuable experiences. They rightly say, experience is a hard teacher - it gives the test first and the lessons afterwords. In the eyes of successful people, experiences make life better, not bitter. What may seem like sufferings are actually trials which tests you, hurt you, cut you, embarrass you - but not to make you weak, but to make you strong so that you can shine like a diamond.So that's why one has to "suffer" before becoming successful - because success comes only after experimentation and taking risks, which automatically invites failures. But what we see as sufferings are just the stumbling blocks, which give the successful people necessary strength to convert these into stepping stones.
