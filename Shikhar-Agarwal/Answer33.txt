Lack of education is the biggest evil, followed by the politicians who believe in divide and rule as far as caste system is concerned in modern India.If you had asked this question 60 years ago, I would have shouted Yes. While there are several theories on the origin of the caste system, ranging from corrupt and powerful brahmins and kings to foreign invaders, brahmins did enjoy an upper hand. Caste system was one of the biggest evil when India got independence. In fact, Mahatma Gandhi started the Harijan movement to create awareness about its adverse social impact.(src: Caste system in India)But after 67 years of real "India", it is unjustified to blame the brahmins for the system enjoyed by their ancestors. While earlier, brahmin used to influence laws, occupy various positions just because of their castes and deny lower caste people of any opportunity, after India's independence, there has been no law which has favored the brahmin castes, nor any special position created for them. Like sati and slowly dowry, these social evils can be addressed only by education and awareness, and if the Indian political framework has failed to provide these to each child and citizen, then brahmins are not at fault. As per the needs of the hour, reservations were rightly introduced, but today even these policies have become a source of divide and a leverage for political vote bank.There is a reason why caste system is lower in urban areas, and why many people in today's younger generation don't believe in it - because of education, awareness and rise of social media. If the evil system is prevailing in the society, it's not due brahmins, but due to the lack of political will to tackle the problem at its root.
