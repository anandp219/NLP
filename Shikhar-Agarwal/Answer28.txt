You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?Neo: The Matrix.Morpheus: Do you want to know what it is?Neo: Yes.Morpheus: The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.Neo: What truth?Morpheus: That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.- The Matrix (1999)Spirituality is for people who have felt that there is more to the world than just materialism, that the world exists beyond what they can touch, see, smell, hear or taste. It's for them who are not satisfied with the world as it appears, who do not find true solace with things around them. It's for them who want to experience limitless joy from their limited and bounded body. They are the truth seekers, trying to bring down the veil of illusion. Yes, in the eyes of common worldly men, they may be considered as losers, but in the end everyone realizes that the race is only with oneself and spirituality helps you win it.
