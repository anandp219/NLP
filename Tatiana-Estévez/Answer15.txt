 Tatiana EstvezThe trick here is to base your quote on assumptions rather than trying to take a wild guess at what might be required.  Try and make these assumptions based on the time and requirements of similar projects. To keep your quote competitive, quote for the core service youre providing and then add the extras on top, as separate elements. Make sure it is clear that these are assumptions and anything outside of the defined scope of work will be charged as extra and at an hourly rate. This may not seem ideal, but your aim is to win the contract, without underselling yourself. Ideally you should also build-in a design requirements phase, not the actual design, but defining what will go into the design.Later when youre going through the requirements, you need to remember what your original assumptions were and align with these. If what the client is asking for is so wildly out of these requirements, then you make it clear that this is all extra at your billable rate, but you can also offer to rescope the work and present with a new quote.
