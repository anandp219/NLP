 Tatiana EstvezThey are trying to do you a favour and allowing you to resign. This means when you go to job interviews you can have your story ready for why this company didn't suit you and why you're the one looking for a better opportunity. This is much much better than having to tell interviewers that you were fired from your last job after a month and explaining to them why you're a bad fit for a small company.You should also consider this feedback carefully. To me what this feedback means is that you probably didn't try to do anything outside of your given role and just did what you think you were there to do. In start-ups and other small business they don't have the luxury of employees who will only do their given role and they need people who are hands on and always looking for how they can do more work, even if that is work they don't normally do. The thing is that attitude isn't considered great for large companies either, it isn't that they want you doing work that you're not there to do, but they don't want jobsworth people who aren't willing to help out when needed. This is just my interpretation though, it would be good for you and your future career if you get as much understanding as possible on why you were a poor fit for the company. Please note that although this company may be trying to do you a favour in allowing you to resign in these particular circumstances (i.e. you've only worked there a month), if you live in a country like the UK that has unemployment benefits there can be a good reason for not doing it like this and that is if you think you won't easily get another job. In this case you will want to 'sign-on' to get benefits and you can only do this is you were fired (you may still be eligible for income support though). Personally, I would still prefer to resign, even if I thought it could be 3 or 4 months before I got another job.
