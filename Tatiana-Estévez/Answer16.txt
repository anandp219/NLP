Please read my blog post for explicit instruction on how to do this for your future reference:How to properly attribute your content with blockquotes by Tatiana Estvez on Moderation FAQsBecause it is not eligible to be uncollapsed. Please read the highlighted part of the collapse text that was on your answer: This answer should explicitly attribute and provide a link to the source of any content that was originally posted on other sources. Lengthy quotations from other sources must be placed in blockquotes. Answers that are collapsed for this reason will not be uncollapsed, even if subsequently edited. Writers must attribute sources and use blockquotes, even if an answer makes some changes/edits to the original material. See Quora's Plagiarism Policy for more information.To be clear, this answer will not be uncollapsed even fixed. We consider this a very serious violation. That other users are violating this policy is not a good reason to violate this policy yourself. Instead you should report them using the in-product reporting function. If you ever want to copy and paste content again you should read these links very carefully as you risk being edit blocked or banned if you violate this policy again. Alternatively only add original content to Quora and you will be safe from violating this policy.
