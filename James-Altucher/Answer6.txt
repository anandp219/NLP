Worrying about relationships, love, loss. Awkward about people, places, things, agendas Agendas. Thinking about the people who were angry at me. Obsessing on the people I was angry at. Scared to fail. Afraid to adventure. Thinking I had to achieve goals to alchemize unhappiness into happiness. Thinking I had to be the smartest person in the meeting, the room, the building, the city, thinking that the only way to I could ever be HAPPY was to get away far away far far away fromHEREjust so I could getTHEREin the land of the goals. In the land of the motivations. In the land of success."What a waste.Now I hear the birds chirping, its not yet 5am. If I can picture it for a second  being a young boy, smiling, I have my bread. Picture what is in the eyes of that boy. Picture those are your eyes. Feel that moment of flight through the air, society hasnt yet given me my orders, my goals. Im free to run, to enjoy, to relax.
