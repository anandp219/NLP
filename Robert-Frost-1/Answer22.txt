 Robert FrostThe most significant use of fuel for a spacecraft, once it has reached its orbit or been inserted on its trajectory, is for attitude control.In order to maintain effective pointing of communications antennae, solar arrays, and scientific instruments, a spacecraft must adjust its attitude. Sometimes this is because of external torques like drag and gravity gradients, sometimes it is because the objects it needs to point at are also moving.The initial trajectory is often not perfect. Spacecraft often have to do small corrective burns to remove errors in their trajectory. For spacecraft that are leaving Earth orbit, there may be several maneuvers needed to facilitate things like gravity assists.For spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), there is friction (drag). There is a thin envelope of gas above the Earth, reaching to over 500 km. As the spacecraft slams into those gas molecules, it loses velocity and thus altitude, necessitating thruster burns to regain that lost altitude.For spacecraft leaving Earth orbit and heading out in the solar system, friction (drag) may not be a concern, but the constant pull of the Sun's gravity will leach velocity from the vehicle.
