 Robert FrostI would pick a truly transformative moment. Time: 02:56 GMT, 21 July, 1969Location: Mare Tranquilitatis, 00.67408 N latitude, 23.47297 E longitude, the MoonI would want to watch Neil Armstrong* take his first footstep onto the Moon.That one small step for a man was a giant leap for mankind. We went from a species that 150 years earlier thought they would never travel faster than a horse, to a species that 66 years earlier made its first flight, to a species that just 22 years earlier first broke the sound barrier, to a species that set foot upon another celestial body - a celestial body 238,900 miles (384,400 km) above us.That moment transformed our species and civilization. We became a people that could break the shackles of gravity and leave our planet, simply because we chose to. No one can take that away from us, except ourselves.*The above picture is of Buzz Aldrin. There was no-one on the lunar surface to take a nice sharp Hasselblad picture of Neil. I would do that for him.
