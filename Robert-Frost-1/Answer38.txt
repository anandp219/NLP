 Robert FrostBoth stories (but more so Jurassic Park) are cautionary tales through their use of the theme that we are out of our league when we try to play God.In both stories, humans attempt to manipulate nature, using technology. They arrogantly assume they can handle nature's response and they end up getting bit, hard, and in one story, literally.Crichton is saying that we often develop technology before we are smart enough to use it, or smart enough to know not to use it. He is pondering on the ethics of playing God.In The Andromeda Strain, humans get the idea that they can search for alien microbial life, in space, and if they find it, bring it home and control it - shape it into a weapon to threaten other humans. Arrogance allows them to think they can maintain control of that life. They are wrong, and disaster happens.In Jurassic Park, humans get the idea that they can recreate extinct species, for economic profit. Arrogance allows them to think they can maintain control of that life. They are wrong, and disaster happens.I'm a strong believer that science and engineering degrees should include a mandatory course on science fiction cautionary tales.
