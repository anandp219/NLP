 Robert FrostThat's purely a personal preference. Some people like to read a book before seeing the movie, some people like to see the movie before reading the book. There isn't an objectively correct order.I don't think there is anything specific to The Martian that should affect the decision.Personally, I'd recommend seeing the film first. If you do that, the characters will all be much better looking, when you read the book.My view is that a book almost always has more content than can fit into a two hour movie. If you read the book first, you may well be disappointed when one or more of your favorite scenes don't make it into the movie. But, if you read a book after the movie, you are getting treated to surprise extra content (e.g. Hermione's SPEW in the Harry Potter books).Conversely, sometimes people find a film more enjoyable if they already understand what they are seeing. If something in the film is unclear, they have their knowledge of the book to help them see it clearly.Another downside to seeing the film first is that it results in the imagination getting less of a workout when reading the book - the images and sounds already exist.
