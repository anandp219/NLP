 Robert FrostHoratio Hornblower and Hamlet.Roddenberry was a big fan of C.S. Forester's series of novels that follow the naval career of a character named Horatio Hornblower. Roddenberry wanted Kirk to be a character that was ambitious, capable of great heroism, possessing a strong sense of duty, and yet troubled by internal doubt in himself. Throughout the novels, Hornblower struggles with doubt, yet is so good at his job that his crew never notice.Roddenberry also sometimes described Kirk as being like Hamlet, a flawed hero, knowing what he must do, but agonizing over it. But unlike Hamlet, Kirk wouldn't vacillate, he would push forward.The characters of Hornblower and Hamlet both display isolation and loneliness. Roddenberry wanted the audience to understand the loneliness of command.The two episodes where Roddenberry made these comparisons most overt were Balance of Terror and Conscience of the King. The former is a naval battle, played out in space. In that episode, there is a scene where Kirk opens his thoughts to McCoy, talking about the awesome responsibility of command. He is put in a position where he must make decisions that could cost the life of every crew member on the ship. The latter episode even takes its title from a line from Hamlet. In that episode, Kirk is put in a position much like Hamlet. He believes an actor that is aboard the ship is a mass murderer from a failed colony, where Kirk spent time as a child. Like Hamlet, a play is used to expose the actor.
