 Robert FrostThe ISS thermal control system utilizes all three heat transfer modes: conduction, convection, and radiation.Devices that generate or store heat are often attached to cold plates. A cold plate is a thin metal box that has multiple channels inside it through which cold water can run. Heat from the heat load conducts into the metal of the cold plate and is then convected away by the flowing cold water.There are two water loops inside the ISS - a moderate temperature loop (MTL) and a low temperature loop (LTL) (some items need to be cool and some need to be cold). The water flows through the vehicle picking up heat from the various cold plates. The water then enters a box called an Interface Heat Exchanger (IFHX). The IFHX is at the surface of the vehicle.Outside the vehicle there is another loop, but this one carries ammonia instead of water. This loop also enters the IFHX.Inside the IFHX heat from the water loop is conducted into the ammonia loop and carried away by the flowing ammonia. That warmed ammonia flows into the radiators and the heat is radiated to space. The once again cold ammonia flows back out of the radiator and around to the IFHX to pick up more heat.
