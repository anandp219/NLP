 Robert FrostCynthia Addai-Robinson (Arrow) and Viola Davis (Suicide Squad)Why is she played by a different actress? Warner Brothers/DC have decided to keep their movie and TV franchises separate from each other.Marvel has a shared universe, which does allow crossovers and continuity between film and TV. There are advantages to that. But, there are also disadvantages. We've seen that although a show like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. can benefit from guest appearances by Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Alexander, and Colbie Smulders and can feed off of movie plots like Winter Soldier, the show is also confined by its subservient position to the films.Diane Nelson, the President of DC Entertainment has said that rather than create a shared universe, they want their projects to be talent based. They want writers and directors to be able to come in and create their vision of the characters, without having to worry about conforming to other properties.In reality, since they created their television universe first, they are pretty much forced into this position. Marvel did films first and television is thrilled to ride the coat-tails of the films. But film cannot ride the coat-tails of television. That's why not only Amanda Waller is different, but characters like the Flash will be different, too. Actor Ezra Miller (left) has been cast as the Flash for Warner Brothers' Justice League films, while actor Grant Gustin (right) is the Flash on television. The two are completely independent. They will tell different stories and have no effect on each other.
