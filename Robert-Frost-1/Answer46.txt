 Robert FrostNo. Ant-Man has, thus far, earned $177,574,000 domestically and an additional $223,800,000 from foreign markets. That's a worldwide total of $401,374,000. It only opened in Japan three days ago and it hasn't even been released in China, yet, so that total will grow. It's still making money in the U.S., pulling in over two million dollars last week.The production budget was $130 million. It is often said that the marketing budget approaches the production budget. With those numbers and assuming a 50% share of the box office going to the studio, the box office may not yet have returned a profit. Studios are usually tight-lipped about the profitability of a movie.Ant-Man cost less than Captain America: The First Avenger and has made more money than that film. It is also expected to pass Thor, once the Chinese market has been added. Since Marvel deemed those films a success, it is safe to say they view Ant-Man a success.Marvel will be looking at the total return, which will include licensing (toys and T-shirts), and then digital, disk, and cable money.
