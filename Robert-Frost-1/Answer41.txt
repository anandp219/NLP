 Robert FrostThe 9th and final season of The Waltons focused on the end of World War II and the challenges of trying to return to the lives they all led before the war. John-Boy, Jason, Ben, and Jim Bob all return from the war.The final episode had John-Boy in New York, trying to sell his book. Rejected (there were too many books about the war), John-Boy returns home. Meanwhile, the Baldwin sisters are disappointed when no one accepts their invitations to a reunion, prompting the Waltons to track down people to come to their celebration. The show ends with John-Boy saying people like the Baldwin sisters inspired him to write a new book.But, that wasn't the end. The Walton's returned for six television movies, starting with A Wedding on Waltons Mountain, in which Erin got married; Mother's Day on Waltons Mountain, in which Michael Learned reprised her role as Olivia Walton; A Day for Thanks on Waltons Mountain; A Waltons Thanksgiving Reunion; A Walton Wedding, in which John-Boy got married; and finally A Walton Easter, set in 1969 and featuring John and Olivia's 40th anniversary.
