 Nimesh Kiran VermaBest is to see the beauty in the philosophy they follow to live their life.Each one of us give some time to think about our insignificant life on the face of this huge planet, which is just a mere spec over time.And subconsciously realize that, what actually matter is the idea,or the thought process which shapes our life what it is!So I personally think that the true and best in thinking about a person is their hidden philosophy of life.Following monologue from the movie V for Vendetta is simply a jewel of perfection and every time I go through it I feel the real pain of the fictional Valarie and can't help myself appreciate her philosophy...I know theres no way I can convince youthis is not one of their tricks,but I dont care.I am me.My name is Valerie.I dont think Ill live much longer andI wanted to tell someone about my life.This is the only autobiographythat I will ever write and,God,I dont remember much of those early years,but I do remember the rain.My grandmother owned a farm in Tottle Brookand she used to tell me thatGod was in the rain.Her name was Sarah.It was her wrists, they were beautiful.I thought we would love each other for ever.I remember our teacher telling usthat it was an adolescent phasethat people outgrew.I didnt.In 2002, I fell in love with a girl named Christina.I couldnt have done it without Chris holding my hand.My mother said nothing.But Id only told them the truth.Was that so selfish?Our integrity sells for so little, but it is all we really have.It is the very last inch of us,we are free.Id always known what I wanted to do with my life,and in 2015 I starred in my first film,The Salt Flats.It was the most important role of my life,not because of my career,but because that was how I met Ruth.The first time we kissed,We moved to a small flat in London together. .. and our place always smelt of roses.Those were the best years of my life.But Americas war grew worse and worse,and eventually came to London...not for anyone.I remember how the meaning of words began to change;how unfamiliar words likecollateral and rendition became frightening,while things like Norsefire andthe Articles of Allegiance became powerful.I remember how different became dangerous.I still dont understand it,why they hate us so much.They took Ruth while she was out buying food.It seems strange that my life should end in such a terrible place,I shall die here.Every inch of me shall perish. Every inch but one. .. and it is the only thing in the world worth having.We must never lose it or give it away.We must never let them take it from us.I hope that,whoever you are,you escape this place.I hope that the world turns and that things get better.But what I hope most of all is thatyou understand what I meanwhen I tell you that even thoughI do not know you,andeven thoughI may never meet you,laugh with you,cry with you,or kiss you,With all my heart,Valerie.
