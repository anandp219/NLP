 Nimesh Kiran VermaWe were together since 9th class (There are many nostalgic memories of the time enjoyed sitting in the last benches :) )Luckily, we landed in the same college: NIT-BhopalI was half-heartedly preparing for IIT-JEE, along with attending college in the first semester.She dumped me at the end of 1st semester (december) for reasons I still can't decipher !I had an emotional breakdown.After a month I embraced myself, my parent supported a lot.Finally leaving the city was the only option left as each and every thing reminded me of her.Took a semester withdraw, gave my heart and soul in the JEE preparation.She called to wish Good-Luck an hour before the examination which left me numb for few minutes and thinking about her for a few times during the examination.Cracked IIT-JEE, by God's grace ! (AIR-2606 )I was going through my rough copies I used then, recently and saw that in most pages the ink was blotted..It was because many time while solving exercises, past memories haunted me and tears come out rolling involuntary."Just When the caterpillar thought the world was over, it became a butterfly..."P.S : She is a nice lady! All women are :) Cogito Ergo Sum
