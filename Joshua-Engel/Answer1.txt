 Joshua EngelAnaerobes can thrive in some formulations of modified air packaging. The manufacturers deal with this in a variety of ways. The main one is to allow some oxygen into the packaging. In the case of bread, it's often going to be there anyway: the bread itself is like a sponge full of air, which contains oxygen. In some cases, CO2 is added. The CO2 reacts with water in the bread, making it too acidic to support bacterial growth. Some breads also contain preservativesI found a 2003 article (http://www.foodsafetymagazine.co...) saying that anaerobic bacteria are still a concern with modified air packaging, and they've linked a couple of outbreaks of botulism to packaged greens. They've started putting more oxygen into those packages to deter it. To my knowledge bread has never been an issue, perhaps because bread is low in water content; anaerobic bacteria generally need some water as a growth medium.Some sources for more information:Innovations in Food PackagingAnalysis and Evaluation of Preventive Control Measures for the Control and Reduction/Elimination of Microbial Hazards on Fresh and Fresh-Cut Produce: Chapter VI.
