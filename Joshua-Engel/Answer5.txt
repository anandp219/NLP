 Joshua EngelMeat shrinks as it cooks. Garrick Saito gave a great answer explaining this process in detail:Garrick Saito's answer to Does pressure cooking beef (as in, a wintery beef stew) result in the same collagen-to-gelatin breakdown (fall-apart, fork tender bites) you get when slow cooking for hours?A beef patty will cook faster at the edges than in the center, because more of the surface is exposed to the heat. The patty isn't swelling*, but everything outside the center shrinks most, rendering it spherical.Thin patties don't suffer this problem as much, because the heat flows through the burger more quickly. Also, patties formed by hand tend to be thicker in the middle, like this:(Credit: Kristen in London " Blog Archive " a quiet month)That's just a function of how your fingers work while handling the burger. People tend to make their burgers thick. If you use a burger press, they'll be more even, and probably won't need the extra thumbprint, though many of them also do some kind of indentation to help even out the shrinkage:Credit: GAME PROCESSING - Chard International----------------------------------* That was my own edit to the question, in fact, since that's how I've heard it phrased before. The original question was more generally about meat cooking, but the details were specific to burgers, so I edited the question that way. The original phrasing might actually have attracted a more general, and more generally useful answer... for which Garrick Saito's answer is actually perfect.
