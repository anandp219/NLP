 Joshua EngelReally, I'd say that baseball is just one of the varieties of cricket. Or rather, both baseball and the various versions of cricket (club cricket, first-class cricket, etc.) are bat and ball games, such as softball and even kickball (similar rules, minus the actual bat).People play the game that other people around them play. The rules drift whenever groups get into isolation, the same reason we have dozens of different varieties of football (of which American football is yet another variant). Eventually, the rules get written down and formalized.So, Americans play their version because it's the game played by everybody with a 1,500 mile radius of them. Countries that remained more closely affiliated with the British empire stayed in closer contact and played the variation with the wickets and the bails and the googlies and the whatevers. They're both equally excruciatingly dull games, and continue to appeal to their fans for the same reasons they always have, an appreciation for the finer minutiae.
