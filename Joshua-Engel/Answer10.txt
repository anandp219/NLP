 Joshua EngelFBecause of Slotting fees.There is a lot of competition for space on grocery store shelves. So much that the manufacturers actually pay the stores to carry their products. They pay even more to have them displayed prominently. These are called "slotting fees".Candy is featured prominently at Point of sale displays. Every customer goes past them, and often purchases inexpensive items on a whim. Fighting for these slots is intense. The major candy brands (Hershey, Mars, and Nestle) don't leave a lot of room. The store makes more money by charging high slotting fees than by making products of their own.There often are some private-label candies on the larger candy aisles, but they only account for about 8% of sales. Interestingly, they account for even less at Halloween: the big candy makers put on a major brand-building push, driving down prices, and the non-name brands can't compete. (See U.S. Consumers Say Boo To Store Brand Candy on Halloween.)Finally, there are issues of scale. Candy requires a lot of equipment to make, and small manufacturers can't compete. When they try, they're often bought out by a bigger manufacturer. That makes it really hard for anybody else to get a foothold, including the types of private makers who could make store-brand candies. See Why So Little Candy Variety?
