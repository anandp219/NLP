 Joshua EngelGetting the hull off is kind of a pain. Ideally, you'd use a grain mill, like this:You're not going to buy one for this purpose. You can fake it by running the grains through a food processor or blender, and then winnowing out the hulls. This will partly grind the grain, and the hulls will separate from them. It helps to have some screening:What I've done in the past is to get VERY old-fashioned. The hulls are light, so they blow away in the wind. So I let it drop in front of an electric fan. The hulls blow away, and the grain falls into a bowl.The basic recipe for raw buckwheat groats would be porridge. No processing is required. You just boil the groats with twice as much water, and a little salt, for about ten minutes or until soft but still a little chewy. Most people like it with a little sweetener, like fruit or sugar, and perhaps some cream or almond milk.In fact, you don't even need to cook it. You can just set the oats and water in a bowl for a few hours, then strain. They sprout, which makes the starches more digestible and sweeter. You can grind them in a food processor, if you like a more porridgy consistency. Again, sweetener and milk/cream/milk-substitute are nice additions. (A bit of salt is also helpful to boost the flavor.)You can roast them if you want, which gives you Kasha (though kasha can also refer to the porridge of unroasted oats). Roasting boosts the flavor, but it's not necessary. It can also be ground into flour, but (a) it's not necessary, and (b) it's kind of a pain if you don't have the right equipment. So for that small amount I'd just cook it up and enjoy as porridge. The porridge can also be done up as a savory. I like to sautee the cooked groats with greens and onions (a dish I make with all kinds of grains; it helps moderate the flavor of really strong greens).
