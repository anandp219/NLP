 Joshua EngelWell... I am absolutely all for learning diversity. The advantage of diversity is that it allows you to achieve the things that you couldn't have predicted beforehand. Nobody knows what will come from the person who majors in ornamental horticulture and astrophysics. Probably nothing. But maybe one of those great "aha" moments, the kind that Asimov described as 'The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not Eureka but Thats funny...'. They might be the first person to be in the right place to get the joke.That means I can't tell you what the process is for doing so. The process is always going to be one of your own invention. I'm actually not crazy about either of the examples you give: the connections between music and math are mostly overrated, and the idea of trying to use statistics to model the process reminds me of what XKCD has to say about xkcd: Physicists. They're famous for encountering a field new to them and oversimplifying it so that they can apply their pre-existing toolkits. Occasionally, that yields new insights. More often, it results in somebody being obnoxious.I'm just nitpicking at details there to point out that it's going to be the unexpected wins that matter most, not the expected ones. The process for learning a diversity of fields is a matter of time management: you study each field in the same way you would if you were a first-time student of the field, then wait for the right ideas to click. If they ever do. How much time you devote to each, and how much to cogitating, is going to be up to your skills, level of interest, and the influx of Inspiration Particles.
