 Joshua EngelWe don't hear much about it, but they seem to basically eat the same things as people. In the Hobbit, we see them roasting meat: The smell of the roast meats was so enchanting that, without waiting to consult one another, every one of them got up and scrambled forwards into the ring with the one idea of begging for some food.and we know that the barrels were filled with wine and other ordinary foods:Some of them were wine-barrels, and these were not much use, as they could not easily be opened at the end without a deal of noise, nor could they easily be secured again. But among them there were several others which had been used for bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of things, to the kings palace.They also baked bread:There in the kings dungeon poor Thorin lay and after he had got over his thankfulness for bread and meat and water.There is also lembas, of course, but that appears to be quite rare, since it has to be made by Galadriel herself. Using The Hobbit as a source is potentially misleading since it contradicts the other books in some places, but in the absence of information to the contrary, it sounds as if the Elves just eat the same things humans eat.
