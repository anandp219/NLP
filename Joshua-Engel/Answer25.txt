 Joshua EngelBecause we live longer.source: Life Expectancy, Explore Map 1 OnlineThe idea of living with a single person for the rest of your life is a lot simpler when that life expectancy is 55 years than 85 years. It's not just that you expect to get bored. It's that when your life span is short, you have to make your decision and stick to it. Backing out doesn't leave you much time for a second crack at it.It's hardly the only factor. Another element is that the western countries have a lot of other social freedoms, and less rigid gender roles. Women are much more likely to be able to earn money on their own, rather than being dependent on a partner to earn money. The west also has a lower fertility rate: if one of the reasons to stay together is to have a two-parent household, then fewer children means fewer marriages.It's a whole host of reasons, but I think that the life expectancy tops it. When you get married at 25, it's a very different thing if you expect it to last 30 years versus 60. Why not get married, and if you don't like it, marry somebody else.
