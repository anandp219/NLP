 Joshua EngelThere isn't any female monologue that hasn't been done ten thousand times, especially not for the ingenue part (since there's just not that many of them). But trawling through the bottom-tier plays does yield a few lesser-known ones. If you want to show off your big-and-weepy, try Constance's monologue:SCENE IV. The same. KING PHILIP'S tent.Thou art not holy to belie me so;I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:O, if I could, what grief should I forget!Preach some philosophy to make me mad,And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;For being not mad but sensible of grief,My reasonable part produces reasonHow I may be deliver'd of these woes,And teaches me to kill or hang myself:If I were mad, I should forget my son,Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:I am not mad; too well, too well I feelThe different plague of each calamity....And, father cardinal, I have heard you sayThat we shall see and know our friends in heaven:If that be true, I shall see my boy again;For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,To him that did but yesterday suspire,There was not such a gracious creature born.But now will canker-sorrow eat my budAnd chase the native beauty from his cheekAnd he will look as hollow as a ghost,As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,And so he'll die; and, rising so again,When I shall meet him in the court of heavenI shall not know him: therefore never, neverMust I behold my pretty Arthur more.Another favorite of mine, in a comic vein (and better known), is Viola from Twelfth Night:I left no ring with her: what means this lady?Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!She made good view of me; indeed, so much,That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,For she did speak in starts distractedly.She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passionInvites me in this churlish messenger.None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,Poor lady, she were better love a dream.Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.How easy is it for the proper-falseIn women's waxen hearts to set their forms!Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!For such as we are made of, such we be.How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.What will become of this? As I am man,My state is desperate for my master's love;As I am woman,--now alas the day!--What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!O time! thou must untangle this, not I;It is too hard a knot for me to untie!
