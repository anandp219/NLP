 Joshua EngelIt would have been wrong to address him as "Montague", since that's not his name. His name is Romeo. "Montague" isn't his surname; it's his family name. When Romeo's father dies, he would become Montague, but not until then. For now he is "Romeo", one of the Montagues."Romeo" may well be the common name of all firstborn male children in the line. It's even possible that Montague him self was named "Romeo" as a youth. This isn't uncommon in Italy. Gaius Julius Caesar's father was also named Gaius Julius Caesar, and so was his grandfather. He was known as Gaius as a youth; he would become known as Julius as head of the gens Julia, or Caesar to refer to the Caesar family (which later became a title). Roman names weren't quite the same as Italian names, but that pattern of prenomen and nomen continued.So Juliet would have known that "Romeo" implied that he was of the Montagues. It might have been more technically correct to say, "Romeo, wherefore art thou a Montague", though that falls a little flat poetically. If Romeo is distinctive to the Montague clan, "wherefore art thou Romeo" carries the same meaning, while highlighting the issue of names that forms the rest of the speech.She goes on to tell him to "deny thy father and refuse thy name". Denying the father would be denying the family feud that's the real issue here. The father's name is indicative of the connection; it implies ownership and destiny. Juliet meditates on the connection of names. She calls Romeo a "title", as though it were part of the inheritance of name and feud. She's wrong, of course, that simply changing his name would do anything. There are a number of places to take the direction from there: how serious Juliet is about it informs everything else about the performance. The text allows multiple interpretations.
