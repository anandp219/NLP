 Joshua EngelSure. In fact, the word "electric" comes from the Greek word "elektron", meaing "amber", because it was well known that you could produce static electricity by rubbing amber. This observation goes back at least as far as 600 BC in ancient Greece, though the actual coining of "electric" from "elektron" didn't take place until the 17th century. So the effect was known. I don't know if you'd say that it was "much remarked on", exactly; it doesn't seem to have been considered a big deal. I suspect that with fewer metal objects and fewer carpets, you don't get the shuffling-carpet-doorknob zorch effect. As soon as science began to take off in the late Renaissance, it became a target of much interest, and it was definitely much remarked on between then and the mid 19th century, which is when you might say that a proper understanding of it was reached. Even then, it would be at least another half-century before the electron was discovered, and without that you can't really say that you understand electricity.
