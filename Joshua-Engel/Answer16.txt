 Joshua EngelThe word "paradox" is used in (at least two different senses, and that can be confusing. To quote the first two definitions from Wiktionary:A self-contradictory statement, which can only be true if it is false, and vice versa. transl. usage [quotations ]"This sentence is false" is a paradox.A counterintuitive conclusion or outcome. usage syn. [quotations ]It is an interesting paradox that drinking a lot of water can often make you feel thirsty.The sense you're talking about is the first one. A valid law of physics will contain no contradictions (since one or the other would be at odds with experiment, and that's the definition of an invalid law of physics). There are no contradictions in quantum mechanics.You might have heard about "paradoxes" in the second sense, which means counter-intuitive rather than contradictory. The laws of physics are designed not to contain contradictions, but there's no guarantee that they won't be counter-intuitive. Indeed, there are counter-intuitive things even in plain ordinary physics, like having an object balance even though the center of mass appears well away from the point of contact:(Credit: 21 Images That Seemingly Defy The Laws Of Physics)So quantum mechanical "paradoxes" like EPR paradox aren't contradictions. They're merely highly unexpected results. Unexpected, that is, by your intuitive brain. In fact, the experiments turn out to yield precisely what the equations tell you to expect. Contradictions would indeed be a problem for physics, but counterintuitive results are officially Your Problem.
