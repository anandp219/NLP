 Joshua EngelEven if you're not talking about quantum mechanics, the notion of "cause" turns out to be poorly defined. Aristotle defined four kinds of "cause". David Hume concocted an eight-part test for something to be a "cause", and it's still not very satisfying.In general, you can use the word "cause" when it's reasonably clear, e.g. "the oil slick on the road was the cause of the accident", and nobody is in a mood to dispute it. If you find that there is confusion over what precisely constitutes "the" cause, then all you can do is stop using the word and start asking what it is you actually want to know. That is, you figure out how you're going to act on the answer to your question, such as "putting somebody in jail for being careless" or "redesigning a car to avoid slipping", and then determine what circumstances can be controlled to make your desired ends come about. It's the element of control, not the determination of "cause", that is the interesting question. The rest is philosophical mumbo-jumbo arguing about dictionaries.
