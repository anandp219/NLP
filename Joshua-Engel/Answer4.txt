 Joshua EngelIn the sense of "tear" as in a hole, no. The deformations allowed by general relativity are continuous. Think of expanding a number line by multiplying it by 2: no matter how many times you do so, you never reach the bottom of it. The Big Rip is not a rip in spacetime itself. It's what happens when the expansion is so fast that the quarks inside of atoms are ripped apart, something that is otherwise prevented by Color confinement. It's not clear what that means; it falls outside of our current understanding of physics. Numbers go to infinity, which points to the need for a new physics such as string theory.According to Soubhik Bhattacharya's answer to Can spacetime be torn? How? What are the consequences of such an event? there are solutions of string theory that allow for a shift in the topology of space-time. That's what you get by combining general relativity (the formula that governs the expansion of space-time that you mention in your question) with quantum mechanics. The rules of that unification are poorly understood, so a lot of things are possible, but it's unclear how many of them are actually physical. String theory right now isn't so much a theory as a framework for one. So basically, it's unclear whether spacetime can rip or not. But if it can, it won't be due just to the metric expansion of space alone.
