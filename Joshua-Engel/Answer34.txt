 Joshua EngelLength contraction means that you can go any place in the universe that you want.For some reason, people often seem outraged that they can't go faster than the speed of light. They can't. But that doesn't mean it has to take forever to get somewhere, because of another prediction of special relativity: length contraction. The maximum speed is fixed, but the actual distance in the direction of travel contracts.So, for example, a trip to Alpha Centauri at 80% of the speed of light is only 3 years, not 4. If you can go 99% of the speed of light, it's less than six months. The faster you go, the shorter the length, and the faster your trip is. There is no limit on where you can go.The trip back is still a problem. Or rather, the people are the problem. Even though you might have gone to Alpha Centauri and back in a year, the people on earth will still have aged 8 years. If you had enough energy you could get to the center of the galaxy and back, in as short a time as you want... but your friends will have been dead for 100,000 years by the time you get back.This isn't really "practical" in the sense that we're not anywhere near being able to crank out that much energy. Anything relativistic is impossible, now and for the foreseeable future, for anything big enough to be visible. Special relativity is still an absolutely critical component of subatomic physics, where the particles can and do move at relativistic speeds. It is tested every single day and is very well confirmed. We know it's true; we're absolutely certain. Even though nobody is actually building a relativistic rocket during your lifetime.
