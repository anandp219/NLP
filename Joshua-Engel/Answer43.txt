 Joshua Engel1.can a rock be hollow from the inside, when I mean hollow I mean a big cavity inside the rock so the toad can fit or live in it.Yes. There are large geodes, for example:Credit: Amethyst Spheres-Amethyst geodes- Amethyst Crystals-Amethyst Pond2.if the rock can be hollow how is it formed in the first place, doesn't a rock need extreme pressure to form which eradicate the possibility of a big cavity inside the rock?.Hollows form in a number of ways. Geodes like this often form in empty spaces (such as gas pockets, or where something has dissolved). Crystals grow into the empty space, over thousands or millions of years.3. is there any chance that a rock will form around a toad or a frog.....can this theoretically happen? please explain why that can't happen?Well, a frog can be buried in sand. But it's not going to survive the procedure. It may hibernate for a while, but by the time the sand has hardened into a rock, it will be dead. A frog can potentially survive for as long as a year, but the kinds of processes that form holes in stones aren't the kind that frogs can survive.So no, this doesn't happen. The various stories of toads in stones are myths and folk tales, and hoaxes. There isn't any good data, just the kind of anecdotal evidence consistent with people exaggerating stories, or just making them up. A decent discussion of the subject: The Frog in the Stone4.last thing how long does it take to form coal?Millions of years, under immense heat and pressure. There is no way a toad could survive it.Sandstone can form much more quickly, over the course of a small number of years, but still too long for a toad to survive it. And the circumstances that make sandstone grow most quickly also cause it to be deeply buried, so that it won't be found for many years. (It also gets very hot, which would surely kill anything inside.)
