 Joshua EngelThe one that drives me nuts is the persistent idea that Shakespeare invented large numbers of words. By and large, he didn't. See How many words did Shakespeare invent and what are they?What happened is that Shakespeare is often the oldest recorded use, but that's not the same thing. The First Folio happens to be a particularly old book that has survived until now. At the time, printing was extremely expensive. And the First Folio was very widely known, so when etymologists started recording the oldest known usages, a word that appeared in the First Folio was sure to be cited, while other older books and letters hadn't yet been checked. As the process grows more automated, the number of first citations to Shakespeare goes down.That's not to say Shakespeare wasn't extremely creative with language. He may well have been the first to use a word in a particular sense, or to have derived some new form of an existing word. He certainly had a way with a phrase: he's definitely the originator of thousands of expressions that are now cliche. He had a very large vocabulary (though again, not really any larger than the other playwrights of the day; see Page on dispositio.net).So he wasn't just inventing hundreds of words out of whole cloth. He wrote plays to be understood, which wouldn't happen if he were just making words up. He was using words that simply hadn't been written down before, or had been written only in books that haven't survived.
