 Joshua EngelI wouldn't call it a "point" exactly. Tolkien famously detested allegory. Being able to reduce a story to some other "solved" story is a pointless exercise for both writer and reader.But Tolkien was big on recurring themes. The same ideas come up again and again, with variations. Tolkien wouldn't force these variations in there. Rather, he'd prefer to discover them organically, as if all the stories in the world formed a tree, and he would explore the leaves. So there isn't so much a literary point as a literary opportunity. What do you make of the connections? Where are the differences, and where the parallels? What about their cases made Theoden saveable and Denethor unsaveable? It won't be as simple as "vice versus virtue", since Denethor is actually quite an admirable steward of Gondor, "wise in the lore of Gondor". It provides opportunities for essays like Pride and Despair: A Defense of Ecthelion's Son, to see Denethor as a real human being rather than a cardboard villain.The similarities give you a good grounding for drawing connections, from which you could look at the differences in detail, rather than as a simple bearer of an allegorical point. That's how Tolkien wants you to read his book, drawing the connections and meditating on them.
