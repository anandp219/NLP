 Joshua EngelThe color of the Martian sky is a different phenomenon from the color of the sky on Earth. Blue skies are caused by Rayleigh scattering, and that works the same on both Earth and Mars. But Mars atmosphere is far, far thinner than Earth's, so the effect is negligible. The ruddy color of the Martian sky comes from the same source as the ruddy color of the Martian surface: red-brown dust due to iron oxide.The color caused by scattering is a function of the wavelength, rather than the content of the atmosphere. The blue sky is blue because it's the longest wavelength. On a planet with a different-colored sky, you'll get a different composition of wavelengths. The shorter wavelengths will always be scattered most, but if the light consisted mostly of shorter wavelengths, you still wouldn't see it because you can't perceive them. (Also, you'd be dead, because the shorter wavelengths kill you faster.)If it's the atmosphere itself that's colored, it could be pretty much any color. If you allow suspensions and colored gases, it could be any color. Jupiter's Great Red Spot is caused by the glow if UV light hitting ammonia and acetylene, for example (according to Color of Jupiter's Great Red Spot Comes from Epic Sunburn). (It isn't actually that color down below; that's the color we see reflected. But at least in theory, any kind of chemistry is possible.) That same article predicts a green sky from ammonium hydrosulfide.So in theory, it should be possible to get any color sky you want, with the right gases or dust. But the scattering is always going to scatter the shortest wavelength you can see, blue.
