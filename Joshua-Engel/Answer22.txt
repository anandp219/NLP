 Joshua EngelNot really.I mean, I suppose it's not impossible. But "civilization" appears (from our limited data set) to be an extremely rare thing. Humans aren't all that radically different from other land vertebrates. Civilization could have been formed any time after, say, 300 million years ago. It didn't turn up until around .006 million years ago. I know it's perilous to extrapolate, but given that the entire point of the question is to take guesses, I'd say that this implies that even if life did exist at one point, practically no life ever turns into civilization. It's just a really rare thing, even on a planet with a lot of natural resources. Mars, being even farther away from the sun and with less oxygen available, would probably have developed its life forms even more slowly.So I'd say that it's almost certainly not "probable". I can't rule out that it's "possible", but only because that word covers such a vast territory. There's absolutely nothing that would give us reason to think that it happened, so even if it's true, it would be only by the wildest of coincidences. And as for discovering it "soon"... you'd be talking about something that left traces that could be discovered, but which can't be found by inspecting the surface from orbit. We've got pretty good topological maps of Mars already, and if they left something like pyramids, we'd have already found them. We already do that on earth, e.g.:Egyptian pyramids found by infra-red satellite images - BBC NewsSo you're hoping that some smaller piece of evidence (say, a metal artifact lightly buried) would be found by one of only two rovers operating on the entire surface of the planet,with one more planned in five years. I'd say that the possibility of finding it "soon" is as close to zero as makes no odds.
