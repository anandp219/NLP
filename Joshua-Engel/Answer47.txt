 Joshua EngelTOS was heavily inspired by 19th century sailing ships, and it drew its rank conception from that. "Commodore" appears in Horatio Hornblower (among other places, as the name of one of the books); Roddenberry had described Trek in the pitch as "a space-age Captain Horatio Hornblower".But the term hadn't been a formal rank in the US Navy since the late 19th century, and so when they redid the ranks for TNG, it was left out. I'm not aware that it was anybody's specific decision; it's not specifically mentioned in the writer's bible. Speculating... it may also be that it helps draw a stronger distinction between the "top brass" side, who were all admirals, and the functioning crew. The manual does specifically say that "our armaments and militarism have been de-emphasized over the previous series", so eliminating the in-between rank of commodore more clearly separates Captain Picard from the admiralty. Commodores command groups of ships, generally in military action, and with the military aspect becoming less important, so did the commodore. Top brass served more as an administrative overhead rather than for military coordination.
