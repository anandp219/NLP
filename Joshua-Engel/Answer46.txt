 Joshua EngelAs a purely biochemical matter, pregnant females are exposed to hormones like prolactin, which stimulates lactation. Prolactin also does a lot of other things; the hormone regulatory system in the body is a complex mess of feedback effects. The extra testosterone in males may help reduce prolactin levels.You probably mean it in the sense of how it evolved that way, and there's never any good answer to such a question. It might well be that some other evolutionary path might have led to male lactation. In general, though, females undergo changes during pregnancy that males don't, so it's not surprising that females evolved to lactate while males remain unchanged. In many species, in fact, the male does not stick around to tend the newborns, while the female is pretty much guaranteed (in mammals) to be there, at least immediately afterwards. So males just never evolved the regulatory mechanism that promotes lactation. Maybe some day it may happen, in some species, though it might be too disruptive of the rest of the male endocrine system.
