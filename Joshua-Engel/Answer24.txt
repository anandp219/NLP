 Joshua EngelIt's hard to say. It's been widely known for many years that these studies were of dubious merit. The field of psychology is both very new and very complicated. It's not unreasonable that people would be coming up with the psychological version of the Caloric theory, and designing affordable experiments designed to feel out what the new theories mean. Even if the theory is wrong, enough small experiments are going to show positive results that you can try to build on the theory.This rationale, however, has been rather taken advantage of. The favorite lab rat of psychologists, the freshman undergrad, is a poor subject. The experiments are easily done, but if very limited applicability. They don't get replicated because they are of little utility. Their value has been exaggerated in the popular press, and while practitioners of the field have a better understanding than the journalists of what the meaning of the experiment, they have nonetheless built a rather substantial edifice on theories of dubious merit with dubious justifications.I think that this result is a warning to the field that it's time to stop considering itself infantile. Enough work has been done that it's time to take its experiments more seriously, and that's going to mean a higher standard of publication. At least, I hope so.
