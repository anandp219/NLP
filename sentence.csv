 Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange are both private companies,0
Actually, at point of time there were nearly two dozen stock exchanges in India,0
You can have any number of such companies to sell/buy company shares,0
Think of stock exchanges as eBay or your favorite shopping website,0
You can buy the same book published by the same company through multiple shopping websites,0
In the same way, you can buy Infosys stock through multiple stock exchanges,0
Would you rather have just one Flipkart or have competition from multiple shopping websites so that the commission charged by the website is low?BSE is the older company dating back to 1875 and by 1992 the government found that it was slacking,0
BSE had no competition back then and its brokers were a closed group of merchants,0
There was very little technology, transparency or openness,0
That was not good for country that was just opening up.Thus, in 1992 Narasimha Rao prodded a bunch of government companies such as LIC, IDBI and SBI to create a new stock exchange company with the best of technology available and a much more open system of admitting brokers,0
Anyone with expertise could become a broker in this new company and not just some nephew of a powerful Dalal street merchant,0
This new exchange also provide better data on the prices and thus it became quite easy for ordinary traders to enter the stock markets,0

 It is just unfortunate and a game of politics,0
It can also be counterproductive as the left wing academia might be playing all its cards too early,0
That group is going all-in and staking all its credibility on an issue in which the central government has very little role to play,0
And most importantly, it is the nation that provides them the award,0
I feel they are insulting the nation for very little fault of them,0
For the first time since independence, the left wing academia has very little hold over the government and its only playing hand is when Modi is visiting abroad - especially the US and UK,0
The protests thus started to time with Modi's visit to the US and is peaking just before Modi's visit to the UK,0
Such protests gets attention of media in US & UK, and bad publicity for India at a crucial diplomatic visit could make the Indian government listen to them.Match a group that feels ignored and a government that puts marketing at the top of its game, and you get such weird protests,0
The accusation is not even one of government committing a crime or a scandal or even being negligent, but a government doesn't condemn publicly every crime that happens in India,0
This can tarnish some of India's reputation,0
Was India a more tolerant place in the past when schools were vandalized and professors attacked, maimed for remotely "insulting" a religion? How was the academia able to hold its conscience all this long when we have past so much bloodshed from every religious group [How do Indians feel about the many massacres that Indians have committed?]? If we stop our hypocrisy there will be a better fight against actual intolerance,0
If not, the award returning will have no impact on India,0
In the domestic politics, the award returning is actually counterproductive,0
The extremists in the right wing want to portray the academia as clueless marxists and by returning the academia is falling right into the trap,0
You can already hear some right wingers gloating,0
What this also does is it weakens the moderates within the right wing who want to respect those academics no matter what political opinion they have,0
On the whole, it might not have that much impact on India,0
None of the artists who returned those awards have any bit of following in the general public,0
General public has little recognition of the names of those returning the awards and some even accuse those who return as attention seekers [intelligent artists who are long past their prime].Most importantly, the actions just tarnish the name of the nation,0
If you have a beef with the BJP or Modi, go and fight them, but don't belittle your nation as none of the awards were given by the present government,0
I have very little respect for anyone who takes domestic politics to tarnish India's image abroad,0
Even if they were returning the awards to protest the Congress government, I would hate them for the same,0
Because, they are insulting the nation for the perceived faults of a political party.,0
 The people who keep overemphasizing the victory of the Labour government in 1945, don't often understand the sequence of steps that led up to India's independence,0
Labour election sure was important, but it just hastened the process by a couple of years,0
In May 1945, Lord Wavell [then the Viceroy of India] presented a detailed plan to the Indians for divesting the power,0
In the plan - Simla Conference - Indians would get full control of everything other than defense and foreign policy,0
In the government, only the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief would be British and the rest would be Indians,0
And this was done when Churchill was still in power,0
This was again a big move from the Government of India Act 1935, when Indians were allowed to elect their own governments, although their powers would be limited,0
Indians still didn't accept Wavell's plan as they wanted nothing but independence,0
By 1945, it already appeared to the British that India could not be ruled without the consent of Indians,0
Congress made it very expensive to conduct a government and various economic blockades by Gandhi made India not very profitable colony,0
The end of war also meant that the Indian soldiers and workers were not needed in as big numbers,0
Had the British tried to continue past 1947, there would have been chaos for which British government was not prepared for,0
As the old saying goes, British Indian government would drown in flood if the 400 million Indians were to just spit,0
By 1947, Indians were prepared for that and from that point it was impossible to govern,0
The best that was hoped was a respectful exit and continuation of economic ties.,0
 Only a small fraction of the Indian Muslims belonged to the ruling class,0
Among that ruling class, a sizable chunk [such as the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Nawab of Junagadh and many Zamindars in Awadh & elsewhere] migrated to Pakistan after the partition,0
A large section of Indian Muslims come from the lower segments of the Hindu society and thus face the same problems of their peers in the Hindu community,0
Instead of comparing Hindus v,0
Muslims as a whole, a better comparison would be comparing two people from the same locality/caste/class background, but only differ by religion,0
Besides the caste composition, there a several key factors:Geography: A large chunk of Indian Muslims live in poorer and often landlocked states,0
Muslim concentration is the highest in J&K, Assam, UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala,0
Other than Kerala, all the other states have low incomes,0
In prosperous states such as Punjab, Delhi, Haryana, Goa, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra Muslim population is quite less,0
Page on prsindia.orgColonialism: While colonialism hit all of India, Muslims were slightly more impacted due to their occupation and geography,0
A lot of them were artisans working in cities like Lucknow and Varanasi,0
They were now out of job through industrial revolution,0
In the new metropolises of the colonial era - Bombay, Calcutta and Madras - Muslim population was traditionally low,0
Unlike the upper caste Hindus, they were not able to switch to the new economy when British Raj changed everything around,0
Rights of Muslim women: While Nehru pushed through major reforms in Hindu civil law, he was too cautious in doing the same to Muslim women,0
These laws on divorce, marriage and inheritance helped Hindu women grow better than their Muslim peers,0
In 1980s, Rajiv Gandhi's government went against even a basic grant of alimony to a Muslim woman in Shah Bano case,0
Again, it is all relative - we are just talking about say 5-10% difference in incomes and education,0
Hindu women too continue to face enormous challenges, but are slightly better placed than Muslim women,0
A community cannot develop without its women,0
Modernizing education system: As much as 10% of Muslim children study in Madrasas,0
Modernity And The Madrasa,0
These degrees are not recognized and don't prepare the students for the modern economy,0
Far less percentage of Hindus graduate from religious schools,0
Government has to look to get a sizable portion of them into the formal schooling,0
I have written another answer on the same topic: What are the reasons behind Indian Muslims' backwardness (educational, social, political, economic)?,0
 Among the popular Tamil actors, many are/were light skinned - MGR, Kamal Hassan, Ajith to name a few,0
There were also a few dark skinned popular actresses such as Savithri,0
Only in the past two decades it seems to have shifted a lot into the lighter skinned actresses.While Tamils like many Indians prefer their icons light skinned, the male actors can get away with being dark if they can provide a powerful acting experience,0
Rajinikanth is dark skinned, but he has plenty of other positives to carry him through to the audience,0
The male actors have to be relatable and thus south Indian boys usually have a major advantage,0
On the other hand, female actors have no way to show their positives in acting qualities as their roles have become quite limited,0
Unlike even two decades ago, most of the actresses are brought from the north and the language is no big deal as they are not expected much anyway,0
They are made to play like dolls and in such a game the hottest light skinned girl wins regardless of how shabby the acting is,0
Since they have no character requirement to be relatable, homegrown girls don't have much advantage.,0
 By sheer coincidence or impeccable timing, both of India's nuclear tests came at a time when a US President was on the verge of getting impeached,0
A President getting impeached is a very rare event and it puts the whole administration in disarray, unable to focus on the world,0
When a US President is distracted, words of rest of Western allies have no biting power.In 1974, India tested one device and didn't openly state it as a weapon,0
It called it a peaceful explosion,0
To prove the point, India conducted the tests on Buddha Jayanthi - the birthday of Buddha,0
The ambiguity and geopolitical factors of that time probably saved India from sanctions although it later impacted India's technological cooperation with the rest of the world,0
In 1998, India tested 5 advanced weapons and dropped the charade to declare itself a nuclear power,0
It again tested the bombs on Buddha's birthday but probably with a wink this time,0
There was also the politics,0
In 1998, the bombs were exploded when the right wing BJP was newly in power and US had a lot of uncertainty about the party,0
They didn't understand BJP as much as they understood Congress and this brought a quick reaction in the form of snctions,0
There was mutual hatred between the BJP and US government for a long time, until things were mended quite soon after the explosion.The ImpeachmentsIn 1974 (first test), Nixon was very close to being impeached [he eventually resigned before the impeachment] and his Vice President was gone on corruption charges,0
This left the secretary of state Henry Kissinger to run a headless show in Washington,0
Kissinger had also softened his stance on India since the 1971 war to liberate Bangladesh, in which US fought on the other side of India,0
This meant that US reaction was very muted,0
In 1998 (second test), Clinton was getting impeached few months down the road [later acquitted by the Senate],0
He was battling a huge storm inside regarding his sexual affairs,0
That said, things were not as dire as in 1974 as the rest of the administration was not impacted as much,0
This left the President to impose sanctions quickly although some critics thought it was still somewhat soft.Another coincidence was that things moved pretty fast in the world of that time that there was hardly anytime to think about it,0
1974 tests followed the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, where Pakistan was split into two and the tests were followed by huge domestic disturbance in India [Emergency],0
There was massive inflation and oil crises world over too,0
It all put the nuclear question in lower priority in both the countries.In case of 1998, again there was the coincidence of a war with Pakistan that now followed the tests in 1999,0
Then a massive election scandal occurred in 2000 and a few months later September 11 changed the whole world for the US,0
Again, there were way many things moving around to focus on the nuclear question.,0
 As others mentioned Modi has a Masters in Political Science and thus he is sure to have read Ambedkar's works,0
It might seem ironic and counterintuitive to some, but the sangh parivar seems to be genuinely taking into many of Ambedkar's teachings - including fighting caste,0
The reason is that castes & caste leaders stand in the way of RSS' consolidation of the Hindu base,0
And no group stands to gain from caste weakening as much as the RSS,0
Here is a fascinating article in The Hindu on this: Hindutva 2.0s new caste challenge,0
This significant pivot in the last decade is one key element in the resurgence of BJP,0
The pivot firmly rests on bringing minority caste in each state to power and weaken the grip of the majority castes,0
Thus, RSS put weight behind Modi in 2001 to weaken Patel control in Gujarat and later put weight behind Nitish Kumar [again from a minority caste] to weaken the Yadav base in Bihar,0
In UP they sacrificed some of their Brahmin votes to Mayawati to focus on the Dalits,0
In Rajasthan, they brought a non-Jat [Vasundra Raje] and in Maharashtra they brought a non-Maratha [Fadnavis] after a long time,0
When the Patels revolt or Shiv Sena goes berserk it is because RSS' pivot seems to be working way too well for them,0
RSS Wants No Bar for CastesIf you thought Modi had a thumping win merely because of his economic ideas or his social media activities, you are mistaken,0
There is something big going underneath.Ambedkar would not have approved RSS' methods nor does RSS accept all of Ambedkar's ideas, but there seems to be a genuine recognition of Ambedkarism in the right wing, even if only in parts,0
They might add him to their pantheon of outside heroes alongside Patel and Bose,0
For Modi and the Sangh, weakening the castes works well for their power interests because weakening castes also means weakening of many of their key opponents [caste leaders].,0
 In many cases it was threat of outright power and war,0
The most dramatic of this is the Indian integration of Hyderabad,0
That kingdom was as big as the whole of UK and Patel's troops annexed it under 5 days with a loss of just 32 men,0
They called it a "Police Action" to avoid getting attention in the international community It was among the most efficient military operations in history although the whole period before and after the operation was marred with massive atrocities against both Hindus and Muslims.The swift operation by Patel's men and excellent diplomacy by Nehru's meant that UN Security Council could not do much despite all of Hyderabad's and Pakistan's pleading,0
Patel also silently let the Communists weaken the Nizam's forces through massive peasant agitations in the months leading up to the annexation,0
In case of Junagadh that makes a sizable chunk of present Gujarat, India sort of waited until the opponent made a mistake and made full use of it,0
The nawab had already left the state and its new head Shah Nawaz Bhutto [grandfather of Benazir Bhutto and father of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto] made the mistake of annexing a couple of smaller rulers who had already conveyed an intention to join India,0
This act was use as a pretext to attack and again very swiftly bring the state into India,0
A plebiscite was later held to confirm the verdict,0
Indian integration of JunagadhIn case of Travancore [most of present Kerala] the king thought he had ports and economy to stake on his own Hindu kingdom,0
Once again the Communists helped Patel's cause,0
A massive peasant unrest and an assassination attempt on the diwan C,0
P,0
Ramaswami Iyer [likely Patel had nothing to do with this] brought the king crawling to join India,0
An excellent book on this is the THE STORY OF THE INTEGRATION OF THE INDIAN STATES by the VP Menon [the person who did the job for Patel],0
 Apart from Mahatma Gandhi and Morarji Desai that Nagarajan Srinivas has already mentioned, there is Sardar Patel, C,0
Rajagopalachari, Netaji Bose, Vivekananda, the historian R,0
C,0
Majumdar who are respected by people of all political inclinations,0
A sizable body of the Constituent Assembly who wrote our Constitution were from the right wing,0
Again, some of these were right wing on religion only (Bose) and some were right on both religion & economics (Rajaji and Patel),0
In the present day again we have one group that is primarily right on religion, but left on economics (the Sangh parivar & a lot of BJP), one group that is right on economics, but not as much on religion (the Swarajya group, the economists Jagdish Bhagwati, Aravinda Panagariya, Gurucharan Das & Ashok Desai) and the rest who are right on both aspects (one faction of BJP such as Arun Shourie),0
Traditionally, across the world right wing is short in academia,0
As the old saying goes, the left wingers with brains become professors and the right wingers with brains become entrepreneurs,0
The right wing is thus still short of more intellectuals, but the tide seems to be turning.,0
 India has seen ups and downs throughout its long history stretching beyond 5000 years,0
For thousands of years, India has had a common culture no matter which empire ruled and which empire fell,0
Mauryas, Satvahanas, Kushans, Guptas, Palas, Mughals, Marathas, the British Raj and finally Sardar Patel kept rebuilding the pieces after everything fell apart,0
Lots of people with a limited knowledge of India predicted that the nation would fall apart easily,0
They have very little clue of the very strong binding forces that underpin India,0
In 1940s, many historians thought the union would not last,0
As late as 1991, New York Times penned editorials about the impending collapse of India,0
Why India's Unity MattersPity India..,0
Indian disunion would be a calamity for human rights..,0
History suggests a terrible cost if India dissolves,0
India didn't dissolve,0
Instead, it has become a major force to reckon whether it is in economy, tech or military,0
We have seen extraordinary levels of violence in the past and the 1980s-90s were a severe test,0
We passed,0
For decades, media painted a bleak picture that the rise of the Hindu right would break India,0
It didn't,0
India continues to have very low crime rates in the world,0
Nothing today is worse than what it was 3 decades ago,0
The past two centuries have been down times for India and such down times have occurred for every civilization in history,0
In the 21st, we will get back to our groove.How did India remain united as one country after 1947, given its huge cultural diversity and religious differences?,0
 In 1947, when India was partitioned there was a lot of pain and confusion,0
Millions were uprooted and hundreds of thousands died,0
It was the biggest human tragedy in Indian history,0
Confused and angry, many mistakenly blamed all this on the Mahatma as he was the biggest target they could find,0
They thought he had the power to stop the partition [he didn't] and he had the power to stop the violence [he did stop a vast chunk of it in the east].For many on the Hindu right, Mahatma was seen as soft towards Muslims,0
They could not see his vision and his message of peace was seen as compromising,0
The biggest issue was the India's west [Punjab to Gujarat] was exploding and no one really anticipated,0
Indian leadership prepared for the worst in Bengal and sent Gandhi to put out the fires,0
And there was nothing really done to put out the fires in Punjab,0
They had no real plans and were stunned by the sheer scale of violence,0
Hindu right was extremely angry on the western side that Gandhi didn't come to save him,0
Ironically, if he were not assassinated, he would have proceeded to Punjab to control the violence there,0
And Mahatma did plan to go to Punjab even earlier [Sept 1947] but was retained in Delhi by Sardar Patel as the situation in the capital was even more dire.Many of Gandhi's peace objectives were also twisted,0
The sad thing was the rumor mill was the key factor,0
55 crores to Pakistan: This was the much talked about thing of that day,0
Indian government over Pakistan Rs,0
75 crores from splitting the treasury and gave an initial Rs,0
20 crores,0
By the time it could give the remaining, the war in Kashmir begun,0
Some in the government want to block the money,0
Others wanted to pay,0
Although Mahatma Gandhi wanted the Indian government to pay what it owed, some twisted this as portraying the Mahatma having his major fast to arm twist the government to pay this money,0
That is absurd - why would he fast just for paying some amount of money? But, many don't question that,0
At the end of the day, the extremists some of whom didn't really oppose the partition wanted the Mahatma [the most vociferous opponent of the partition] to act as just a partisan Hindu instead of an Indian,0
They saw his overtures to bring all communities together as a threat,0
They mistakenly believed that the Mahatma was the source of this violence & believed he caused the partition and he fasted to pay the 55 crores to Pakistan.,0
 It is an outdated theory that refuses to die,0
The idea is that there was a huge lost continent south of Tamil Nadu,0
While many civilizations believe in such submerged islands [Atlantis], the sheer size & imagination of Lemuria is massive,0
If it were a country it would probably be the second largest,0
When I was a school kid I too fantasized about that after being misinformed by some of my school teachers,0
The idea was invented in the 1860s when an English zoologist noted that there were these monkeys called Lemur that were found in Madagascar, India and some parts of South East Asia,0
Thus, he had an hypothesis that a landmass connected all the three,0
Later as we begun understanding geography and human evolution better this theory became untenable,0
While the scientists abandoned this theory, a fringe group of Indian/Tamil supremacists took hold of that theory,0
Around the turn of the 20th century, there was a huge interest in race, migration and nationalism,0
Some Indians thought that the superior blooded Aryans came from the North pole while a few others thought the Dravidians came from this lost continent,0
Both sides wanted to boost their egos at a time when the wave of nationalism and identity seeking at its heaviest,0
There surely was a massive landmass under Indian Ocean, but that was between 2 billion - 85 million years ago,0
Far before mammals, leave alone humans,0
Fragments of ancient continent buried under Indian OceanWhile I believe that there were such massive landmasses well before human history and there were possibly many cities submerged near TN coast line, it is crazy to believe in a huge continent that supported the ancient Tamil civilization.,0
 A lot of us naively believe that we can build our new cities without taking any bit of agricultural or forest land,0
The fact is that there is hardly any good land left in India that somebody is not already using for something,0
40,000 acres is about 161 sq km,0
That is barely enough for a major city,0
London and New Delhi are about 10 times bigger than that,0
If things go by plan, up to a quarter of Andhra's 5 crore people will live in this major metropolis extending from Guntur to Vijayawada,0
How do you accommodate that big a population with all their apartments, schools, roads and hospitals?Maybe AP could build its capital in western Rayalseema districts without a lot of fields,0
If you build the capital in say Anantapur district, where would you get the water to support crores of future residents to this new capital city? The district is bone dry as it is,0
You need a massive water source to support a crore people,0
Historically, great cities have always been built next to rivers or other great water sources,0
In case of AP, this would have to be Krishna or Godavari,0
The problem is that every bit of land next to these rivers is fertile & used for agriculture,0
There is no way to build a great city without taking agricultural lands and that was true of most of the great cities in the world - whether it is Delhi or London or New York,0
Andhra Pradesh has an area of 3,95,87,200 acres of which farm lands are nearly nearly two-thirds,0
It is not running out of farm lands any time soon,0
Far less than 1% of this farmland is taken away for the capital and all other infrastructure projects,0
If there is an agricultural crisis it is not due to a shortage of land, but due to mismanagement of water, poor access to technology and lower productivity of the fields,0
India could potentially double the farm productivity enabling it to cut the arable land by as much as a half in the future.,0
 It surely is a major crime and how dare they do it in a secular country,0
We should ban such a heinous practice of chanting Aum near the tomb of Mahatma Gandhi,0
Next up, the government should ban the use of decimal number system as these ten digits have been devised by some Hindus in the past,0
Hindu numeral system,0
Such a blatant use of Hindu cultural symbols in a secular nation would hurt the sentiments of so many,0
To avoid the risk of India becoming a Hindu nation, the government should be made to use only Roman numerals everywhere,0
MMMMDCXXXVII crores this year should be earmarked for reprinting government documents,0
OMG can I use crores here without hurting anyone's sentiment? Because it is from Koti that is used in many Hindu scriptures,0
After that we should picket the homes of Viswanathan Anand, Koneru Humpy and other Chess grandmasters,0
How dare they publicly play a game devised by the Hindu monarchs,0
Such a casteist, racist, non-secular game where the white plays first must be banned,0
That is blatantly varna system and these upper caste slave owners are hurting the sentiments of millions,0
Balaji Viswanathan's answer to Is it racist that white makes the first move in a game of chess? After this, we will go after the school kids learning trignometry,0
The first use of sine and cosine tables come from ryabhaa's sine table and using such trigonometric tables in a blatant way from a Hindu would hurt the sentiments of so many,0
Next we will go after Diamonds,0
Those shiny rocks that some Hindu folks first discovered are playing havoc when it comes to buying rings,0
These stones long used as religious icons is non-secular,0
We will ban the entire diamond industry [double bonus, it is centered in Modi's state] and anyone wearing diamonds will be labeled as Modi bhakt,0
Finally, all Indian dance forms, music forms, drama arts should be banned near all government offices, because they all have their roots in religion,0
We should also take our lion emblem out, the national motto [Satyameva Jayate] and even the national flag because they all have religious symbols underneath.Secularism means a saint like Sankaracharya would not be passing laws in the Parliament, you will not be barred from becoming the head of the country merely because you are from religion X and the court would not punish you merely for not following a principle from Gita,0
But, it doesn't mean every element of Indian culture be removed from the public,0
Secularism primarily had its roots in Europe, where the Church historically had an outsized role,0
Indian religions don't have such a central church nor a powerful Pope and thus our Constitution was not written with the problems & paranoia of Europe in mind,0
Indian version of secularism is about tolerance and acceptance of all faiths like we always did through history, not a fanatic removal of cultural/historic symbols from public life,0
Should an Egyptian be forced to defend their great pyramids? Is a Greek expected to avoid talking about Herodotus or Alexander or any Greek symbol because of a possible (later) connotation with the crusades? Why is an Indian expected to avoid ancient Indian symbols and culture just because some outsider put a "religion" tag over this?Is the "Om" specific to only "Hinduism" or is it spread across a variety of Indian cultures? Where does Indian culture end and "Hindu" religion begin? How do you plan to whitewash Hindu religious elements without whitewashing Indian culture too? Once you whitewash this culture on what does the nation rest upon?,0
 If you include income, literacy, infrastructure, sanitation, gender rights as the primary factors North East scores better Odisha,0
Odisha's interior districts often drag down the state's overall indicators.Percapita income,0
Worldwide, this is considered one of the key factors in deciding if a region is developed or not,0
Other than Assam, all NE states have incomes higher than Odisha,0
Page on pbplanning.gov.in This is the same result for life expectancy at birth, unemployment, school enrollment and riots rate,0
In each case only Assam stands out in NE, while rest perform better than Odisha.Human Development,0
HDI is an index that measures a variety of things including literacy, income, and life expectancy,0
All NE states perform higher than Odisha,0
List of Indian states and territories by Human Development IndexPoverty ratio: If you count the percentage of poor in each states, all NE States other than Manipur have fewer poor than Odisha,0
Indian states and territories ranked by povertyCrimes against women: If you rank Indian states by violence against women, NE states have far fewer crimes against women than Odisha,0
Interestingly, Kerala seems to have the most crimes against women,0
Indian states and territories ranked by safety of womenThe same results for these other indicators too,0
NE states perform better than most of India, not just Odisha,0
Electricity coverage: households having electricityToilet availability:  availability of toiletsHIV awareness: HIV awarenessThat said, Odisha is better than the Northeast in a couple of indicators: drinking water, suicide and Child Nutrition,0
However, the overall winners are the states in the North East.,0
 One thing I want to add to Luke's good answer is that it also depends on which class & locality you are born in,0
If you are going to be born as a poor villager, then India is likely worse than Vietnam, Iran and China,0
India's healthcare, sanitation and primary education is terrible if you are poor.If you are going to be born in a rich, urban family India is the best place to be in,0
Ultra rich often face trouble from the party in China and face slightly more security issues in Vietnam,0
A rich Indian can have an outsized power in the society, have access to great education & healthcare and can also greatly utilize India's fast growing economy,0
Politicians, media, army and the civil society will not come in the way of a rich person,0
If you are going to be in the urban middle class, it is a tie between China and India,0
Middle class Chinese have a variety of advantages - such as far better roads, airports, trains & uninterrupted power, while a middle class Indian has better political power, the benefit of English & better relations with the west to travel the world more,0
A simple example is that, for an Indian it is fairly easy to get a 10 year multiple entry visitor visa in US, while until recently Chinese were limited to 6 months at a time [due to reciprocal arrangements],0
Middle class Indians and Chinese are thus roughly comparable in the range of benefits they can get from the society.Edit: There seems to be some confusion in the comment thread on what Middle Class means,0
Middle Class in Indian standards refers to about $600/month [10 times less than in the west] and that translates to about Rs,0
40,000/month,0
Only a small fraction of India is in middle or upper middle,0
Everyone in India thinks they are 'middle class' and almost no one actually is,0
 It is not easy to build a new capital on top of an old city,0
To create the modern roads and other infrastructure, you need to demolish a lot of existing buildings in that city & it is both expensive and time consuming,0
There will be a number of court cases and it is a headache,0
It is better to build a city from scratch, like New Delhi and Chandigarh,0
That way you have the new city that will be in addition to other cities, nor be a mere replacement,0
Just as New Delhi subsumed old Delhi, Amaravati would subsume Guntur and Vijayawada - this way providing a taste of the old culture and the modernity of the new city,0
Amaravati is also a great name as it connects the state to its glorious past.,0
 Gupta empire is the longest of major Indian empires extending for nearly three centuries,0
Mauryan empire lasted about 150 years; Mughal and British Raj each lasted slightly less than 200 years each,0
It had among the strongest of militaries and most efficient of administration among any Indian empire.It is in Gupta dynasty in which India had some of its greatest achievements,0
From chess to sex (kamasutra), from zero to Shakuntala, from Panchatantra to ayurvedha, the key elements that defined Indian history were made then,0
Aryabhatta developed 0 and the number system in this period,0
Varahamihira built the greatest works on Indian astronomy,0
Kamasutra was written by Vatsayana, Kalidasa brought the greatest of Indian drama that impacts Indian art to this day while Vishnu Sharma's Panchatantra stories entertain Indian kids to this day,0
In visual arts, we see stunning elements of Gupta art in UNESCO world heritage sites such as the Ajanta & Ellora caves [part of the caves were developed in Satvahana period though],0
Sushruta brought some of the greatest medicinal works for his period,0
It was under the Gupta, Indian education went to great heights with the establishment of the Nalanda University among others,0
It is fascinating to see that even after 1500 years their works are as good as new to us,0
We are continued to be fascinated by Shakuntala, Chess, zero, Panchatantra and Kamasutra,0
And Nalanda stands as a great inspiration for what can achieve.Literature, mathematics, physics, painting, medicine and religion were all in their glorious heights, while there was social stability, peace and economic prosperity,0
It is easily the golden age,0
If I had a time machine, 400 AD Ujjain would be my destination followed by 1000 AD Thanjavur [Chola Empire].,0
 Actually, Fortune 500 CEOs are more likely to have engineering background than anything else,0
Nearly a third of them did engineering in their undergrad,0
That said the functional role that led to the CEO path is quite diverse,0
Finance leads it at 15% of CEOs coming through that role,0
33% Of CEOs Majored In Engineering Of the 100 best CEOs 29 have MBA degree, 24 have engineering degree and 8 have both,0
The Best-Performing CEOs in the WorldA few other interesting statistics from: The Path To Becoming A Fortune 500 CEO75% of the CEOs come from operating related roles [such as COO] 30% of the CEOs took time early in their careers to build a strong finance foundation.Only 33% of the CEOs spent all their career in that company,0
Rest moved around,0
Average age for a CEO at the time of appointment is 50 and the average time spent in that company is 16.Nearly half of the CEOs spent time as a non-executive director in their company.Engineers are preferred choice for CEOs,0
 The biggest feature that will make or break India is its demographic,0
We have the world's largest population of youth by a huge margin,0
We have 356 million people in the age group 10-24 years old,0
That is more youth than US and China combined,0
India has worlds largest youth population: UN reportThis means we have a population that can potentially jump to the newest technologies and ideas without the burden of past baggage just as easily as Indians took Quora,0
We could quickly climb up the economic ladder by skipping past the past,0
Politics can move quite quickly the elections of Modi and Kejriwal showed,0
On the flip side, we have a huge population for which we don't generate enough jobs or have enough skill development avenues,0
Unemployment, crime and social unrest can happen if the expectations are not matched,0
The second feature is the arable land,0
India has almost as much arable land as United States - world's leader in that measure,0
With 162 million hectares of fertile land, India has more agricultural land than even China with more than thrice its area,0
This was the key feature that helped India throughout history,0
However, as we need land to build homes, factories and roads, we would have to take a chunk of this arable land,0
We cannot eliminate poverty without building people homes and jobs,0
This means India's success or failure will depend on how much of the agricultural land it can take away for other uses & make sure these are utilized well.,0
 In case of the first wave of English colonies (16th-18th centuries), the people from England settled in those colonies,0
Not just some men toting guns, but whole families - men, women and kids who made their voyage on Mayflower and countless other ships,0
Due to a variety of religious revolutions and civil war, many common English folk took these ships as a way out,0
In contrast, in other European countries there was not as much pain in that period to move whole families out,0
French, Dutch, Germans and Italians just stayed put at home,0
Only a few young men were sent and they would return after their mission,0
No major families or settlements abroad,0
Spanish and Portuguese settled more than the French and Dutch, but still were not moving as much as the English,0
[South Africa was one exception for the Dutch,0
There they Dutch stayed in large numbers & had a prosperous nation that was at the same time the worst for the natives.]In that wave of English colonies - US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - the locals were mostly driven out to remote settlements and the English immigrants totally took over the land,0
They brought their ideas and technology and built their homes,0
Since they were settling permanently they were more vested in ensuring rights, liberty etc,0
Other colonial settlers were not settling for good and out there to make a fast buck out of the resources and markets,0
Thus, they never setup as good infrastructure - social and physical,0
They also didn't bring the best of their technology,0
At the same time, other colonial powers didn't always wipe the native cultures as much as the English did at that time,0
From the late 18th century onwards the situation flipped,0
It was now the English who were done with the civil wars & revolutions and the rest of Europe picking up the chaos,0
Englishmen stopped settling outside in droves and in the second wave of colonization - India, Malaysia, Kenya, Egypt - they did like what other colonial powers did,0
They sent their young men to war, to trade and to rule, but they didn't send their families to settle,0
This meant that the native cultures were not exterminated, but at the same time the colonial masters had little incentive to think in the colony's main interests - as they were not settling there anyway,0
It was at this time that a lot of Germans, Italians, Irish and other Europeans took the boats to escape the chaos,0
They settled in large numbers in the US and elsewhere,0
However, by then England and other powers had already setup their culture,0
Thus, even when Germans rivalled the English in numbers in North America, US & Canada never turned German, but remained British,0
Britain's colonies ended in two extremities,0
On one end you have prosperous ones like US & Australia and on other end you have Myanmar, Zimbabwe, Sudan, etc,0
The difference is how many English tried to make the colony as their home vs see it merely as a land for exploitation,0
South Africa fall somewhere inbetween,0
At the end of the day, colonization provided two choices - lose all native civilization & culture or lose all of economic power & prosperity,0
All colonies lost at least one of the two,0
If the Native Americans & Aborigines lost their civilization & homelands, Indians & Egyptians lost their economic prosperity.,0
 Asian is a term too broad and is an outdated, Euro-centric way of looking at the world,0
Every civilization had an equivalent of "others" - people who were outside the civilization and Asia is just one such term [people who were not in Greek world of Europa],0
It makes no sense to put Japan and Syria in the same bucket as there is very little connection between the two - no common history, language, race, religion etc,0
This map is a slightly better grouping of the world,0
It does a good job in most places,0
However, this too suffers by grouping Africa as a monolithic unit.Here is an even better map used by UN's food & agricultural organization.There is a glaring issue of grouping Iraq with South-Central Asia and not including Japan in East Asia, but overall the above is the most accurate I have found,0
Such grouping can help you understand world issues better.,0
 There are two episodes in the Bangladeshi Liberation War,0
The one between March 1971 [when Mujibur was arrested] and end of November 1971 was the civil war,0
India while supporting Mukti Bahini and other rebel movements, was not officially a part of it.The two weeks between December 3 and 16 of that year was the Indo-Pakistan war,0
Indo-Pakistani War of 1971,0
Pakistan started it by sending a bunch of jets to attack India and India hit back,0
Both countries involved their navy, airforce and army,0
India captured territory and armed forces,0
And the war was not just in Bengal, but all over South Asia,0
India even had to cover up Taj Mahal as Pakistan jets tried to hit Agra,0
It was the only time India lost a warship as INS Khukri (F149) was sunk with 176 sailors,0
India has done such sacrifices during that war and taking India's name out of that war is sheer insensitive for any Bangladeshi,0
In short, there was a Bangladeshi civil war for the most part of 1971 and then a direct Indo-Pakistan war at the end of it,0
Both are important and related, but different,0

 When I went to buy my first car, the dealer gave me a 0% loan for 6 years,0
That ensured that he got my business that day [selling the car] and for a few years to come [maintenance, supplies] and even the potential to sell the next car a few years down the road,0
Seller financing is a prominent business strategy where the seller closes the deal by offering sweet financing,0
A lot of major businesses do that,0
And so do many countries,0
Japan does that, China does that and so does India on a smaller scale [prompting questions like why India provides aid to Nepal etc].In India, Japan and China are fighting to dominate the world's hottest rail market,0
China was leading in the game of finishing India's first bullet train that will get a lot of publicity and copycat projects,0
However, China didn't finance the deal,0
Japan entered the market with a easy financing deal and pocketed the deal,0
In this, it was not really different from my car dealer who gave a 0% loan to me to pocket business from a rival.To build the bullet train, you need a lot of things,0
Some of them will be made in India and the rest will be made in Japan,0
In the contract, Japan has said that 30% of the things has to be bought from Japan,0
There will be a large number of exports from Japan to build the bullet train,0
That is a lot of jobs,0
Once the line is built, there will be maintenance and adding new train carriages,0
More exports and more jobs.The Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train is just a starting point,0
If this works, India will be building advanced trains all over the country,0
And trains are just one among dozens of new things India will make - new homes, new cities, new factories,0
Trillions of dollars are at stake here,0
Like a Venture Capitalist, Japan is trying to enter the market early and capture it before others come in,0
At the end of the day, it is business,0
Just as your shopkeeper provides you cheap loans to buy TV, phones and other appliances, countries provide you loans to buy their technology and products,0
Do you think the Audi dealer below is providing you charity by providing a 0% loan? No,0
Neither does Japan.,0
 A big factor is the Kissinger's diplomacy in the region that time,0
In their massive geopolitical game with USSR, US was blinded on its own key principles - killing democracy in Iran and Afghanistan, helping the French fight freedom fighters in Vietnam and helping Pakistan unleash a major genocide (1971 Bangladesh genocide),0
In the process of helping Pakistan during that genocide, Nixon made India very insecure, forcing it to go nuclear,0
While India was always interested in going nuclear, the key event that tipped the balance was the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war,0
In that war, India was able to split Pakistan into two - create the new nation of Bangladesh,0
But, it was also a war that made India nervous because a number of big nations was on the side of Pakistan,0
US, UK, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia all threw their weight behind Pakistan,0
Sri Lanka provided logistical support and China helped slightly with weapons,0
The US 7th fleet was closing in on Bay of Bengal [US forces had orders to target Indian Army in 1971] and the danger of US fighting India directly was only avoided by the massive presence of Russian ships blocking off that route - 1971 War: How Russia sank Nixons gunboat diplomacy,0
China too luckily didn't bite Kissinger's tasty treat of attacking India on all 4 directions.After the war was won, Indians never forgot how close they got to being surrounded by world's superpowers for the mere fault of trying to stop a major genocide in what is now Bangladesh,0
India understood the importance of nuclear deterrence and also the value of military power,0
Nine months after the war, Indian Prime Minister ordered the preparation for the test,0
Within the next 20 months, India tested its first bomb.Indira Gandhi knew that the west would react harshly, but she had very little to lose,0
The west had already burnt its bridges in the 1971 episode and there was very little moral, economic, military or strategic argument that the west could make to stop India from going nuclear,0
By going nuclear, India is actually able to help its poor,0
Wars affect poor disproportionately and through the power of nuclear weapons, India was able to stop fighting wars,0
No one dares bomb a country with nuclear arsenal,0
India's last full scale war was in 1971,0
By proving its worth, India got recognized by the western powers on a more equal footing and the resulting large trade since late 90s has helped chunk of poor grow to middle class.The post-nuclear India is far better at protecting its people than the pre-nuclear India.,0
 Let's start with the assumption,0
Kashmiris Muslims hate India,0
Many do hate, but not all,0
What about the minority of Kashmiri Muslims that love India? What about their fate if the state is taken over by Pakistan? What about the fate of Kashmir's non-Muslims? The state of Jammu & Kashmir especially has large regions of Hindu and Buddhist populations whose fate is dreadful if India gives up the state,0
Protecting the millions of Kashmiris from chaos is what India wants,0
Because, we don't want another 1947 and another failed stated in the border.Why would India never give up Kashmir?The state of Hindus and Buddhists in Pakistan are far worse than the state of Muslims in India,0
The lives of few million people is worth the trouble.Indus waters through the state is essential for India's water security,0
Without that north India would be in a chaos.The high hills are also India's main defense for its northern plains,0
If J&K goes to Pakistan, Indian Punjab can be surrounded quite easily on 3 sides and the capital would be only a few hours drive from Pakistan,0
The state has already returned to peace and only recently turned to the voting booths in large numbers, placing their hopes on Indian democracy,0
India can always further reduce the anger by providing better infrastructure and having a more transparent law enforcement.,0
 Trying to catch the Indian Air Force napping, Yahya Khan, launched a Pakistani version of Israels 1967 air blitz in hopes that one rapid attack would cripple Indias far superior air power,0
But India was alert, Pakistani pilots were inept, and Yahyas strategy of scattering his thin air force over a dozen air fields was a bust!  -- Newsweek, 20 Dec 1971Pakistan officially began the war,0
The details are a bit more complicated though,0
The genesis of the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war lay in the 1970 Bhola cyclone - the deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in history and one that killed nearly half million people in East Pakistan,0
Remember, back then Pakistan had an eastern wing and an western wing.Pakistan's leadership was very slow to address the damage in a region it had traditionally ignored,0
Coincidentally, Pakistan had its national elections just 3 weeks after that disaster,0
The angry masses of East Pakistan whose traditional grievance got aggravated by the cyclone, came in large numbers to provide a thumping victory to Mujibur Rahman led Awami league,0
Pakistani general election, 1970This meant that the center of power had finally passed from the Punjab region to the Bengal region where Awami league was predominantly based,0
However, that didn't turn out to become a reality,0
Mujibur was never allowed to become the Prime Minister as the national assembly meeting [Parliament] to have these elected representatives vote their PM was postponed,0
By March, 4 months after the elections, the Awami league grew impatient and launched a non-cooperation movement,0
In response, Pakistan's President Yahya Khan imposed a martial law and a brutal repression of the Bengalis [especially the Bengali Hindus and Bengali intelligentsia] termed the Operation Searchlight.On 25th March, Mujib was arrested and taken to West Pakistan,0
This led a major outcry and a rebel commander named Ziaur Rahman declared the independence of East Pakistan on 26th March in a radio address,0
I, Major Ziaur Rahman, do hereby declare the Independence of Bangladesh in the name of our great leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.[This day is now celebrated as the Bangladesh independence day,0
After independence, Mujib would be the President until 1975 when he and most of his family was assassinated,0
Zia became the first dictator following him,0
Their daughters - Sheikh Hasina - daughter of Mujib and Khaleda Zia - wife of Zia are the two major leaders of present Bangladesh - keeping the rivalry alive to this day,0
Hasina and her sister were the lone survivors in their family's brutal assassination, as they were studying in Germany].Back to March 1971,0
As protests exploded in East Pakistan, refugees came in droves to India,0
The plight of Hindus especially moved India reminding of the brutal scenes of 1947,0
Indian PM Indira Gandhi assisted the rebels with money, training and arms,0
,0
Throughout that year things becoming getting worse for both India and Pakistan,0
Pakistan was now emboldened by the warmed relations with her two friends US & China and truly believed that the help of the major powers would help her "Crush India" - major campaign slogan across Pakistan,0
24 Crucial Facts About 1971 War When India Bifurcated PakistanBy the beginning of December, war was imminent,0
It was then that Yahya Khan tried what Israel did 4 years ago to the Arab countries,0
On Dec 3, he launched waves of planes to cripple Indian air defense and named it Operation Chengiz Khan,0
Unfortunately for Pakistan, despite all the inspiration it was neither the great Khan nor Israel,0
PAF tried to hit as far as Agra, but India had the Taj covered,0
[Partial covering shown below]India quickly hit back,0
At the height of the cold war, in it Pakistan was assisted in that war by Saudi Arabia, United States, United Kingdom, Indonesia, Sri Lanka,0
The bigger power China, expected to join, didn't,0
However, even with all that external support Pakistan could not face the onslaught of the much superior Indian forces,0
Soviet Union's task force too thwarted any US Navy involvement in the Bay of Bengal,0
1971 War: How Russia sank Nixons gunboat diplomacyPakistan, at the end, lost far more aircrafts, far more ships and far more men,0
It was cut into two and it surrendered within 12 days of the beginning of the war,0
Instrument of Surrender (1971),0
It was a stunning collapse from the euphoria of catching Indians napping to surrendering tens of thousands of men in an embarrassing surrender - all under two weeks.ConsequencesIt was a defining moment in Indian history,0
It was one of its biggest military victories in the modern era,0
It led to its later confident rise.Cutting up Pakistan's access to most of the Indian ocean & South East Asia with the loss of Bangladesh was a huge strategic gain for India,0
This was the only war when US and India came close to facing off against each other,0
Only Soviet Union's nuclear triad put out this nasty standoff,0
The value of nuclear deterrence was far clear to India now and India went nuclear not long after this war - Smiling Buddha.While Pakistan's military spun up their military disappointments positively in 1948 and 1965, in 1971 it was hard to cover up the defeat,0
Bifurcation of the nation even with the world's leading powers supporting it, was too hard for the military to explain away,0
Thus, Pakistan switched its whole strategy to covert warfare fronted by rebels and 1971 became the last full scale war between the two countries,0
The victory eventually allowed India to build friendships with the countries that sided Pakistan - US, UK, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka,0
External powers bet on the winning horse and Indira Gandhi ensured that hers was the top dog in South Asia and not Pakistan.,0
 Let's separate Qatar & Brunei from Luxembourg, Singapore, Hong Kong, Liechtenstein etc,0
Qatar has the world's third largest deposits of natural gas and has less than 300,000 citizens,0
If you divide that large a resource among that small a population you get crazy high income,0
Apart from the energy, it doesn't have any important industry worth mentioning,0
Brunei is somewhat close to that description.Regarding Singapore, Hong Kong, Luxembourg etc they are trading cities sitting next to massive countries,0
Cities are in general wealthier than the countryside,0
If Mumbai and Shanghai were counted as independent countries, they have a higher GDP than Singapore and Hong Kong compressed in a comparable geographic area,0
List of cities by GDP,0
Does that mean Mumbai and Shanghai are better than Singapore and Hong Kong? By being counted in larger nations with much higher rural population their GDPs are sometimes less appreciated.Thus, it is not about being a small country or a large country,0
It is about being a city sitting in an important trade route vs,0
a rural region stuck somewhere,0
Singapore is a small rich city-state in an important trade route while Nauru is a small poor rural nation that has no such benefit,0
In the same way, USA is an large rich urbanized nation with massive amount of trade while India is a large poor rural nation with far less trade,0
While we should surely learn a lot from Singapore and Hong Kong, we should also make sure we are comparing apples vs apples - Singapore vs commercial cities in a country than the entire country itself.,0
 Siddhartha was probably born in Nepal,0
But, Buddha was born in India ;-)That is a cheeky way of saying both nations can claim ownership of him and that the India-Nepal division didn't exist at the time of Buddha,0
In that sense, Buddha was like William the Conqueror who though born in what is now France is mostly associated as the King of England,0
Buddha was born in the capital town of the Shakya kingdom,0
There is no agreement on where exactly this capital was,0
There are 3 close towns that each claim to be the birthplace of Siddhartha and the capital of that kingdom,0
Two of them are in present day Nepal and one in present India,0
All 3 towns are along the modern India-Nepal border,0
ASI digs into Buddha home debate,0
PBS produced an award winning documentary on this topic in 2013 although it ends inconclusive,0
Bones of the BuddhaLumbini in Nepal is the most popular of the three,0
Given that Lumbini is in present Nepal, they have a part claim to his legacy,0
However, the prince who was born in that capital town achieved glory when he meditated under a Bodhi tree at Gaya, changed the world through his sermon at Sarnath and eventually claimed his divine abode in Kushinagar,0
All of these places are in present India,0
That means India can also claim his legacy regardless of whether Piprahwa was his birthplace or not.At the time of Buddha, the political boundaries were also different from that of today,0
India is a cultural union that touched almost all of the subcontinent, but the political boundaries were often different from that,0
Here is India at the time of Buddha and the kingdoms straddled the present day borders,0
,0
 Doesn't look to align with India's strategic interests,0
Building modern states along ethnic lines is something that doesn't fit with India's model of multi-ethnicity and it is fraught with dangers,0
If India supports Kurdish identity [who span multiple modern nations - Iran, Iraq, Syria, Turkey] what about the question of Nagas who span India and Myanmar,0
That is dangerous,0
Recognizing a Kurdish state might bring India directly in conflict with Iran, Turkey and Iraq,0
Iran is a traditional friend and with Turkey India is trying to open new relationships,0
Traditionally India has avoided such touchy, controversial issues and it would ideally push for Kurds to be worked into the national framework wherever they live.,0
 The premise is disputed,0
I will still take the bite,0
India is traditionally resource-constrained, while Europe & US is labor constrained,0
India has a lot of labor, and Europe-US have a lot of resources,0
This have an impact on the respective lifestyles.In the US, I can easily afford a Dishwasher, have access to reliable water and lot of electricity,0
In India, my maid would wash with much lesser water and electricity than that,0
While driving, I use the automatic in the US as the gas/petrol prices are quite low and the decrease in efficiency is worth the comfort,0
In India, the resource price is higher and might go for a chauffeur driving a manual,0
Most Indian families do fine in the US as they quickly adjust to the new society as above,0
They don't miss their maids and chauffeurs much.Things get tricky when you have a child,0
Unlike dishwashing or vacuuming, childcare cannot be automated and thus it is fairly hard to raise kids,0
You need to constantly look after them, run after them and clean after them,0
This is where many Indians miss labor abundance back home,0
Thus, many Indians ask the help of their parents to help with the kids,0
Locals too have huge trouble managing kids without nannies, but they have a wider support network [parents, siblings, friends, cousins] locally while Indians in US often have none,0
In summary, it is not about daily chores there is a problem,0
It is in raising kids where expat Indians often face a pain,0
Kids are lovely, but also take up a lot of energy to manage.,0
 Other than the 19-20th century CE, cold weather regions were not really ahead of the economies of warmer regions,0
Historically, the civilization was centered around warm, tropics & subtropics,0
The first 5 civilizations - Sumer, Nile valley, Indus Valley, Yellow river valley, Norte Chico - were all in subtropics,0
The ones that followed - in Greece, Persia, Rome were in the same zone too,0
Subtropics often were better than tropics because the latter was often next to dense rainforests with wildlife & epidemic dangers,0
Still the warmer regions performed better throughout history.Colonialism changed this dynamic for the first time,0
I will explain this how,0
The cold weather regions have very low population density as not many people preferred cold winters,0
This allowed the farmers to have much larger lands and more potential mines & mineral resources,0
Until the modern era, these were hard to tap though.When industrial revolution came, the technology drastically helped those in cold climates,0
Mechanised farming - tractors and other machines - allowed industrial scale farming over those lands,0
This allowed the farmers to get rich because they had now huge lands that could be fully tapped,0
Factories also could now get minerals resources and infrastructure as large parts of their countries were sparsely occupied,0
In contrast, industrial revolution could not do much to densely populated tropics that already had high farming productivity - but shared by a large number of farmers,0
Tropics were too densely populated - meaning lesser resources & lesser room or infrastructure.Other aspect colonialism did was to open up huge markets,0
England had a small domestic market - population was small,0
But, through its colonies it got a huge market for its textile mills and industries,0
In earlier times there was not much international trade and thus those in sparsely populated regions could not benefit from their innovations.In 21st century CE, we are entering a post-industrial era and the pendulum might be shifting again,0
Mines and lands are not as important as they were in say 20th century,0
It is about the number of minds networked,0
In this, the subtropics/tropics such as California, Singapore, Shanghai or Bangalore are getting back in the game,0
The size of the domestic market matters big once again - as Californian startups could attest and density helps in various other ways too for an information economy.,0
 On October 12, 2015 a couple of radicals allegedly stole a copy of Guru Granth Sahib [holiest book of Sikhism] and these torn pages have emerged from a variety of places,0
Sikhs were enraged by this desecration and there are protests across Punjab,0
To make things worse, couple of protesters were killed in the police firing, further aggravating the situation,0
Why are Indian Sikhs angry?There are a variety of speculation on who might have done this tearing,0
One of the accused is a controversial sect called Dera Sacha Sauda whose leader Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is facing several criminal cases on unrelated cases,0
Couple of weeks ago, he stirred controversy with an offensive propaganda movie - MSG-2 The Messenger.Indian media is also claiming "foreign" links with the usual suspect - Pakistan's intelligence agency believed to have been behind this,0
Lot of speculation and little clarity.Intelligence Agencies Warned of ISI Plot to Create Trouble in PunjabPunjab desecration case: 2 brothers with foreign links held,0
 Many nationalist Indians would say yes,0
And once India has joined Nepal, there would be reallocation of seats in the legislature,0
Given India's size and population, 95% of the Nepali parliament would be Indians,0
These legislators would then pass a law to change the name of the country to India and change some of the national symbols,0
The rest of it would not have to change much as India and Nepal share a common culture,0
Job done ;-)I always smile when nationalists of other countries desire for a large chunk of India,0
There is the "Greater Nepal" or "Khoarsan", "Mughalistan" etc,0
If a sizable chunk of India is joined with Nepal or Pakistan or whatever other country, that resulting county would be Hindu by the sheer size of Indian population,0
Thus, Indians would be the dominant population in that "Greater Nepal" and they would legislate a variety of things that Nepalese might not like.,0
 Around the world people do crazy things to appear attractive,0
The whole world of cosmetics and cosmetic surgeries would be out of business if people stopped being insecure of their beauty,0
Think of tanning salons, sunbathing, fairness creams, tattoos, skin piercing..,0
people in every part of the world do dangerous things in their pursuit of beauty,0
And this didn't start in modern era, but is as old as human civilization,0
Tribes around the world have painted their faces in all sorts of fancy colors for ceremonial reasons as well as for aesthetic reasons.We probably carry innate animal tendencies to spend effort on looking for our mate and make ourselves attractive in the process,0
Skin is a good indicator of a body's health and thus people do all sorts of things to make the skin appear good to "prospective mates",0
In some places, tribes would abandon their children or even kill if they were born light skinned (Persecution of people with albinism),0
In other places, being born as dark skinned would bring discrimination,0
It is all about what each society thinks of being healthy,0
And in modern world most often these are stupid intolerance,0
Also see: Why are Indians color obsessed?,0
 As others mention, Japan and Germany have a sizable military,0
That said, post Second World War, both Japan and Germany put strong anti-war provisions in their Constitutions,0
This was partly pushed by the allies controlling their territory and partly came about as the moderates came out in disgust of the calamity,0
Article 9 of the Japanese ConstitutionThe world war also pushed out the hard right wing out of power for a long time,0
The prospect of having a highly weak army that would invariably draw comparisons with their military past also meant that military's purpose was strictly defined to domestic security,0
Also, the need for a large military became moot after the US military umbrella promised them to secure their resources,0
Hitler went after Russia to secure oil in its south,0
Japan went after SE Asia to secure iron ore and other raw materials,0
Post-WW2, both nations got all their major resource access protected by US and this provided very little rationale for war,0
In some sense, western nations pay an implicit tax to the US in return for US fighting wars to protect all of their trade routes and raw materials,0
This is Adam Smith's specialization.,0
 It was a marriage of convenience primarily connected by their common fear of the Soviet Union,0
Both hated the Communists and in the 1930s signed an anti-Comintern pact,0
Otherwise there was little ideology overlap as Hitler thought China to be their ally and Japan was looking at UK,0
As China entered into a pact with USSR, Hitler moved to Japan and as Hitler was gaining on UK, Japan wanted to pick the winning side in Europe.Later, both found US to be a huge threat and feared the entry of US against them,0
This moved them even closer and once US entered the war against Japan, Germany too declared war,0
Ultimately both fought two different wars,0
While we simplistically group them as WW2 just because the Allies fought both, there was not much overlap between the Pacific and the Atlantic war,0
They started and ended on different times, involved different motivations and strategies and didn't even share much of troops or resources due to geographical barriers.,0
 It starts with energy - natural gas and oil,0
Iran is right next door to India and has plenty of gas and India is extremely energy insecure,0
It is a match made in heaven,0
All other sources of energy are far from India and through expensive ships sailing across piracy infested routes.Then there is history,0
India and Iran are very strongly related culturally throughout history,0
They share the same race, same family of languages,0
Iran means the "land of the Aryans" and Arya has superior connotations in India,0
Until Hitler came to misuse the term, it used to be much widely used,0
Hinduism and Zoroastrianism are sister religions worshipping the same gods,0
Later, Islam spread into India and Persian culture became widespread - in food, language etc,0
Then there is Afghanistan,0
India and Iran share very close ties with Afghanistan, which is often at conflict with at Pakistan's interests,0
It was the Indo-Iranian funded Northern Alliance that helped US win the Talibans,0
In the past few decades, Indo-Iranian ties went into strain as Iran went close to Pakistan & US in coldwar and later India went close to Iraq & Israel,0
These are now getting rebuilt,0
Iran likes India more than any other country and India in turn has a favorite outlook of Iran,0
Attitudes towards Countries,0
 War is one of the biggest motivators to bring new technology,0
WW2 drastically increased the money, motivation and political resources available for science,0
Two related factors that really revolutionized science was the Tizard Mission - where the UK effectively gave away all its tech secrets to the US so as to build enough weapons to counter Germany,0
The second one was the German scientists who were then given the resources of US and USSR after the war to build massive projects,0
US got to moon with a Nazi scientist,0
Space explorationNazi Germany originally developed the V-2 rocket to hit Britain,0
It was the world's first ballistic missile,0
After the war, US and USSR split up Germany and got a large number of these German missiles, facilities and scientists,0
This is how both countries got to space in the 1950s,0
Nuclear ResearchThe Manhattan project to develop the atom bomb was the largest ever research project until that time,0
The race to build the bomb produced major breakthroughs,0
A decade post the war, Soviet Union [again with the help of German scientists] began civilian production of electricity and two decades later it became a key energy source for the world.MedicineAlthough Fleming had invented Penicillin in 1928, it was not put to wide use,0
It just stayed low until war needed it,0
Suddenly it was produced at massive numbers and had a major change in global health,0
The cavity Air travelUntil 1940s, air travel was primarily for the adventurers,0
The main issue was the cabin was not pressurized leading to very high discomfort when flying high,0
For the war, Boeing produced B-29 that had cabin pressure and this quickly became a standard in civilian aircrafts,0
How Things Work: Cabin Pressure,0
Radars, radio navigation and a variety of things needed for modern aircraft have their origins in the war,0
More importantly, we now had Jet engines due to the war allowing much higher speed and range of airplanes,0
CookingMicrowave oven really became a practicality only when cavity magnetron was invented,0
Someone (Percy Spencer) working at Raytheon found melting chocolate in his pocket and that became the motivation for the oven.ComputingWhile computers were around for more than a century, they never got major government patronage or big use case,0
The need to break enigma machine provided all the resources needed to make a computer work,0
Without the war, introduction of computers might have been delayed by a couple of decades.,0
 Every god needs a satan,0
Every revolution needs an enemy to turn people's anger upon.Iran and Israel historically had good relationships,0
Iran helped Israel in this war against Egypt, and in turn Israel helped Iran fight Iraq,0
However, the 1979 islamic revolution needed an enemy,0
The Ayatollah could not make Saudi Arabia his #1 enemy as the place is too sacred for Muslims,0
Israel and US became the easy enemy,0
Even when they have often worked together behind the scenes, there has to be a public appearance of beating the enemy and this is important in every revolution,0
Israel and US helped the Shah & indirectly helped fight the revolution,0
This was one of the angers,0
Israel stands in Iran's way to develop nuclear weapons,0
Iran uses its proxy armies in Hizbollah and Hamas to control the region and this affects Israel's interests,0
Iran also wants to be seen as the leader of Islam and shouting for Palestinian interests brings credibility & attention.The Iran-Iraq war of 1980s provided a period of common interests,0
In 1988, the end of Iran-Iraq war and the scandal of the IranContra affair [involving US-Israeli arms trade to Iran] pushed Israel & Iran back,0
Iran also moved closer to Saudi Arabia this time,0
For both sides there is a fear of survival,0
Iranian government fears the failure of revolution if the lightning rod of their hatred - Israel goes away and people warm up to western ideas & culture,0
Israel government fears the further expansion of Hezbollah and Hamas.,0
 Two years ago the media was talking about whether India was becoming the "rape capital" of the world,0
Now, there is very less mention of rapes,0
Has India suddenly become a great country for women in a matter of months?While Dadri is a terrible tragedy and we must make sure mob justice is prevented & law order handled, we must also be careful not to take media as the barometer for what is happening in the country,0
One swallow doesn't a summer make,0
If just one incident alone would make a nation go from normal state to extremist state, we must either be setting an impossibly high bar for ourselves or we are just kidding ourselves,0
Hate crimes happen across the world and this is why we have police and courts,0
If people stopped criminal activities, we would not be needing police,0
To objectively judge India is getting intolerant/extremist, we need to define some variables [say deaths from communal violence], take the trend over a period of time and also compare that with other nations,0
I have quote a few statistics here: Is India gradually becoming intolerant as claimed by the Sahitya academy winners? and it doesn't look like India is getting any more extremist,0
The beef issue is centuries old,0
Indians never really revolt,0
But, in 1857 they did and ended East India Company partly because they suspected there might be beef in the gun cartridges used,0
There was no RSS/BJP back then,0
Imagining that beef controversy is just specific to BJP or 2015 is being totally ignorant of Indian history,0
Pretending that people just started caring about it now or it is somehow related to Modi is ignorant,0
We have had riots for beef well before modern India, well before politics,0
Every culture has its own set of taboos (Why are the British revolted by the idea of horsemeat?) and not paying attention to it is not smart,0
Let's again put this in perspective with the rest of the world,0
Let's get into the concept of hate crimes - violence motivated by religion, ethnicity etc,0
[Violent hate crime,0
International Statistics],0
Leave alone West Asia or Pakistan,0
The most peaceful Canada has 1200 hate crimes a year with 1/40 of India's population (Police-reported hate crime in Canada, 2013) and highly developed Sweden has about 6500 hate violence incidents (Record increase in Swedish hate crimes) with 1/120 of Indian population,0
France and Ireland have far more,0
India too is likely to have lakhs of such incidents every year,0
If you want to start counting all the ink throwing, all the harrassments in a country with 1.3 billion people - you will need a lot of fingers,0
Only difference is that the national media in other countries don't cover each individual hate crime in lurid detail,0
They focus on patterns, trends, statistics when they report crime,0
This is not to justify violence, but helping you understand reality,0
Taking a handful of crime incidents to brand India more violent than other nations is stupid,0
World is a violent, hate-filled place and finger pointing doesn't help change for better.In summary, it is an unfortunate incident and a crime,0
We must look to solve them,0
However, let us also not exaggerate one incident and take it to label a whole nation,0
If we do that, we could put any label on any community.,0
 For centuries, Japan was a frontier region that enjoyed a fair amount of cultural influences from China, while still remaining independent,0
In many senses, it resembles Britain that again was a frontier for a long time looking up to the empires of the mainland,0
In the 19th century both had enlightened monarchs (Queen Victoria and Emperor Meiji) who ruled a very long time and took their countries to their heights.Perry ExpeditionIn 19th century, Japan was under feudal lords with only a nominal power with the emperor,0
It was a very closed and stagnant society,0
This changed in 1854 when an American named Matthew C,0
Perry was dispatched by President Fillmore to force the opening up of Japan,0
There was both a religious missionary motivation as well as business motivation,0
US and China had a very booming trade capitalizing on China's fall and US wanted to extend that to Japan too,0
Perry Expedition and Gunboat diplomacy,0
With warships threatening Edo (Tokyo), the local chief Abe Masahiro had to give in and open trade with the west,0
Like in China and India, the trade with the west didn't go well for the Asian country as it was not in their terms,0
It was disastrous and shred the Japanese economy to pieces,0
To make matters worse there were massive earthquakes that shook Japan - in a physical as well as a metaphorical way,0
Ansei great earthquakesWithin a decade the Shogunate [rule of feudal lords] came to a dramatic end through public anger,0
The teenage emperor called Emperor Meiji took up the throne after his father was poisoned,0
In that time, the emperor formally ruled from Kyoto, although the real powers were with the Shoguns based in Edo (Tokyo),0
Meiji RestorationMeiji made Edo the formal east capital (now named Tokyo) with the recognition of economic power,0
He abolished feudalism with powers moving out of the Shoguns, Daimyos and Samurais,0
That said, many believe that oligarchs still had a quite a large power even after the restoration.The emperor brought a modern army by extending the power to bear arms beyond just the samurai,0
The disgruntled samurai were then employed in various government bureaucracy,0
The transition to modern army and navy made Japan stand out in Asia and allowed it to eventually deal with the west on more equal terms.In parallel, there was a massive industrial revolution,0
A ministry of industry was created in 1870 and a whole bunch of industrial conglomerates called the Zaibatsu arose,0
Literacy rose quickly and women were employed in large numbers by the nascent industries,0
This crashed the birth rates and the,0
 newly liberated classes were now openly adopting western culture and clothes after centuries of domination by the samurais,0
In the 40 year period from 1872, railways went 400x from 18km to 7100km,0
Coal production multiplied 30 times,0
Silk production multiplied 10 times and merchant ships multiplied 60 times.20th century warsThe massive growth of economy, partially helped by lack of competition in Asia, and a modern army brought a very aggressive Japan at the turn of the 20th century,0
Its first victim was Russian Empire and the defeat of Russia in 1905 was a major coup,0
Getting recognition from this, Japan fought with the allies in WW1,0
After WW1 it felt cheated that it got none of the colonies from the losing powers and tried to go on its own,0
With a very hungry domestic economy, it had to go for more and more resources,0
This led it to occupy Korea, China and eventually most of East Asia,0
Their aggression and ambition was matched by Nazis on the west and thus they both entered into a marriage of convenience, although neither side really liked the other,0
As Japan feared the entry of the US into the war, it tried to preempt by attacking Pearl Harbor in Hawaii,0
Their gamble failed due to multiple reasons including not attacking Hawaii's oil stores and aircraft carriers,0
This left US only partially wounded, but very angry,0
US had its revenge in a war that climaxed with the dropping of atom bombs.Post-war reconstructionJapan was thoroughly beaten and totally disgusted with war,0
They put in their constitution to effectively outlaw war and put all their energies in economy,0
US liked such a distraction as that would mean Japan would not become a major threat and also be its big trading partner in Asia, especially after China fell to the Communists in 1949,0
Gen,0
Douglas MacArthur was especially instrumental in this transformation,0
After the Korean war in 1950s and rise of cold war, Japan became US' principal ally in the Pacific - bringing more aid, more technology and more trade,0
While the war left the infrastructure broken, it left a highly educated and motivated populace who could now rebuild the cities with the state of the art 20th century technology instead of saddled with old infrastructure,0
Japanese government and its Ministry of International Trade and Industry on its part did a fantastic job pushing their corporations to dominate world trade,0
With rising education, falling fertility, Japan enjoyed a massive demographic dividend - with parents totally focusing on careers unimpeded by children [or so they thought that time].,0
 Landlocked: India's least developed states - Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh are all landlocked,0
Access to sea is a huge factor especially in modern era centered on global trade,0
Obviously, this alone is not a factor as a few states like Punjab are developed despite being landlocked.Government expenditures: Here is the table of how the governments spent their development expenditures per person,0
Bihar and UP got the least resource allocation, while states like Punjab got as many as 5 times per capita allocation,0
Part of this reason could be higher population of Bihar for which it was punished many times,0
For a long time Bihar & UP got very less dams, irrigation projects, roads, railways, airports or any such infrastructure,0
Political circus: Between 1961 and 2005, Bihar's leadership changed as many as 30 times,0
List of Chief Ministers of Bihar Political instability meant no one would invest in the state,0
In the 1990s, when India was getting large foreign investments, Bihar that accounted for more than 10% of the population received only 0.10% of the FDI,0
As anarchy loomed, caste became far more important for organization than in most other states,0
No new urban development: Madras, Bombay, Bangalore, Calcutta, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, New Delhi are all modern cities - built in the past 400 years and with the technology of present time,0
Bihar and UP have no such cities,0
There is an excessive reliance on ancient towns such as Patna and Gaya - built for different times,0
While Patna was expanded a bit in the British era [with the addition of the "New" City], no new cities were built from scratch for such a massive population,0
With no cities & modern jobs, Biharis have to travel as far as Mumbai and New Delhi and often face brunt of xenophobia.Extremely large political units: Bihar and UP are too large political units,0
They have more people than all but 10 countries,0
This makes governance very hard,0
Even in the past, Bihar was part of monstrous political units such as Bengal that had more people than the next largest units - Madras and Bombay combined,0
List of states in India by past population While the split of states in 2000 helped the smaller Bihar grow fast, it is still too big to govern and its past poor growth still impacts,0
Industrial policy: Bihar had a large textile industry that mostly vanished in the British Raj,0
Colonists made peasants grow crops like Indigo and this led to wide agricultural crisis prompting leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi to launch his satyagraha at Champaran,0
In independent India, the freight policy that provided practically free transportation for Bihar's raw materials all over the country meant that industries chose the coastal towns instead of locating closer to the resources,0
No major reforms: After independence, Indian government started its land reforms to take lands away from exploiting feudal lords,0
In the south it succeeded,0
In the gangetic plains, it didn't,0
Feudal Zamindars had a huge sway from UP to West Bengal until recently,0
Here is a good paper on this from which all the data in the post was sourced and goes deeper into the factors,0
Page on tandfonline.comAlso see: Causes for Development Disparity between the Indias North and the South,0
 Two very different issues.In case of the Tibet dam, China was not building in any river, but one of the key water sources for India and Bangladesh,0
The dam is the largest in Tibet and the river serves over 100 million people,0
Tibet's largest hydropower station starts full operation,0
In a water scarce subcontinent there will ofcourse be worries when rivers crossing multiple nations are dammed this way,0
If the river were not a shared resource there would have been no concerns.In case of the South China sea lighthouse, the lighthouses are made over disputed reefs in an area claimed by half-dozen countries,0
Over $5 trillion of world shipping moves through them and no one wants a war/conflict there,0
China completes construction of lighthouses in disputed South China Sea,0
If those lighthouses were not in disputed reefs there would have been no issues.If you see these issues from the other side of the table, you can see why they can be worrisome.,0
 Other than a couple of its neighbours, India's relations with the rest of the world is fairly ok,0
Most of India's hostilities are dated post-1947 and precursors of the present Indian state didn't have major enmities with the rest of the world,0
India's key enmity is with Pakistan,0
The brutal breakup of India to form Pakistan in 1947, the bloodshed accompanying this partition, the non-resolution of things in Jammu & Kashmir still keeps the hostilities alive,0
India and Pakistan have fought 4 wars.With China, India's conflict is more nuanced,0
India and China historically coexisted without much conflict,0
Their only conflict is traced to a brief border tussle in 1962,0
However, outsider powers have always played a role,0
China's relationship with Pakistan and India's historic relationship with US & USSR has played hidden games,0
What are all the conflicts between India and China?With Nepal, India has had a cordial relationships despite occasional roadblocks like what is happening over the past few weeks [autumn 2015],0
In Myanmar, India has a neutral stand with potential for deeper relationships,0
With Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bangladesh, there has been moments of highs and lows,0
India helped Bangladesh win independence from Pakistan and helped Sri Lanka win over Tamil terrorist outfits,0
In Maldives it helped fight coups,0
In Bhutan, India has the most friendliest of its neighbors with no major tussles,0
Afghanistan would be the second friendliest neighbor for India although the Taliban period strained the relations temporarily,0
FriendshipsIndia's closest ally is probably Israel and both nations significantly underplay their friendships to their public,0
India doesn't want to irk its friends in the Islamic world and Israel plays along.After Israel, India's key friends are US and USSR,0
US has had key interests in the subcontinent and in general helped better peace despite its friendship with Pakistan,0
With Russia, India has had very cosy relationships through most of the cold war although that friendships are a little low now,0
In France, Germany and Japan, India has its biggest technology & defense partners,0
These relationships are getting stronger as of 2015.In the commercial sector, India's closest friends are Singapore and Mauritius - both with a huge population of people with Indian ancestry and key conduits of capital into India,0
With countries of British commonwealth - UK, Australia, Canada, Caribbean etc, India has a somewhat positive relationship with Cricket providing both the friendliness and rift [India Cricket board is among the most hated],0
These ties have not been fully capitalized until now.In Africa, India has some kinship relationships and there has been traditional warmth on both sides,0
However, this has not translated into trade or geopolitics until recently,0
India's ties in South East Asia is somewhat similar,0
There are historic relations and buddy relations developed from colonization and period of Non Aligned nations,0
But, only recently they are getting translated to economy.In West Asia, India has a lukewarm friendship,0
It has a lot of interest in the region including oil and immigrants, but the region's friendship with Pakistan and some of India's domestic troubles have not made this into a deeper friendship,0
Iran and UAE are probably India's closest friends in the region at present, although in the past there were warm ties with Iraq and Egypt,0
In Latin America and Central Asia, India's relationships are very limited and mostly focused on oil exploration,0
There is a long way to go there.Looking ForwardOne advantage going for India is that its hostile powers are not that well regarded internationally as of 2015,0
Pakistan, for instance, is widely seen as the culprit although only a few decades ago the shoe was on the other foot.India was also not exploiting its diaspora around the world and focused too narrowly on its strategic interests,0
In the past few years, there is a welcome change as the diaspora is used to build new bridges,0
There is much more focus on economics and geopolitics than any time in India's past,0
This pragmatic thinking is making for more involved relationship with the rest of the world.One thing that might surprise you is finding who looks India's influence positively,0
It is Iran, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Nigeria,0
Those are all the countries in which India has not fully engaged in trade relationships,0
Attitudes towards Countries,0
 Contrary to popular myth, every part of India had its own mighty warrior classes,0
Valour is not regional,0
That is how you could have great empires emerging from every part of India,0
If Sikhs were the only martial group, we would have had the rest of India ruled by their empires,0
There were 18 major martial classes in British India: Martial races of undivided India and much more before that,0
How come there are more Sikhs in army and less Sikhs at the top? There is one theory that is used in a few places like this book: Civilian Control of the Military (pg,0
49),0
Indian politicians have always feared the military's incursion into democracy and followed principles from British Raj to carefully engineer the army,0
One of the key principles is to keep one group of loyal minorities form the army and some other loyal minorities run the army leadership,0
Of the first 20 Indian Chief of the Army Staff, there were two Kannadigas (Cariappa, Thimayya), two Tamils (Kumaramangalam, Sundarji), two Telugus (Shriganesh, Rao), two Gujaratis (Jadeja, Manekshaw), two Jammu Kashmiris (Malhotra, Vij), two Marathis (Rodrigues, Vaidya), two Bengalis (Chowdhuri and Roychowdhury), two Punjabis (Thapar, Raina) one each from MP (Bewoor), Kerala (Padmanaban), Uttarakhand (Joshi) and NWFP (Malik),0
One thing we can see is the spread of regions - from Kashmir to Bengal to Gujarat to Kerala, although the army is far less heterogeneous,0
This way no one region gets too powerful when it comes to heading the Army,0
Next we see their tenures shorter [typically about 2 years vs 4 years in case of countries like the US] preventing them to become too settled,0
The third is that Army Chiefs are carefully selected from places [such as south India, Bengal or Kashmir] that would neither align with the bulk of army [drawn from Sikhs, Gorkhas in more numbers] nor align with the bulk of the population [political power in the Gangetic valley],0
This seems too precise to have evolved on its own without some political engineering,0
In the past 10 though it seems army leadership getting less engineered [finally Sikhs get their due credit at the top with two Chiefs of Staff] as the government finally stopped fearing the army, but instead sees a bigger role for the defense as India aspires to be a superpower.,0
 I don't believe in Aryan Invasion Theory, because there was nothing called Aryans [Indo Europeans is the right term], there is no proof for an invasion [of Indian kingdoms] and it is not a theory [more of a speculation],0
The Aryan Race: Time to Forget About It?The Aryan theory is mostly fantasy used by both Indologists and Hindus with the script that a few racially pure [Arya] fair skinned folks riding the chariots just swept past vast chunks of the world, including India, winning the "inferior" dark skinned people who were too weak to fight a handful of invaders,0
This theory was liked by Hitler, many extremists Hindus as well as many extremist non-Hindus,0
It is time we put a rest to it,0
While I do believe that there is a strong commonality between European, Indian and Iranian cultures and there surely were human migrations, I don't believe in the idea that a vast chunk of India is populated by a handful of outsiders who moved around 3500 years ago,0
Math doesn't add up there,0
Population doesn't add upIndia was densely populated as early as 500 BCE based on Arrian's and other outsider accounts of India,0
To account for 50-100 million people who made India's population then after clearing the vast chunks of the subcontinent battling dense tropical jungles, malaria & other diseases, it requires a few thousand years of migrations and not just couple of centuries,0
India has been invaded so many times in the past and so it is not hard to believe that India was invaded by Central Asians,0
But, in all the invasions we know of since then [of Afghans, Hunas, Europeans], only political control was changed, not the populace,0
England came with the most modern of invasions and ruled centuries with all the technology, but with little change in the population itself [Anglo Indians form a miniscule population],0
So what was so special in the invasions of circa 1500 BCE that was so different from the later invasions that the population itself changed? How did the cold weather people so swiftly get used to India's brutal climate that no subsequent invader really survive?For a few thousand Central Asians unused to India's weather and diseases, with inferior technology, to just sweep across the subcontinent so efficiently that there is no trace at all for invasions, master agriculture, complete a total domination of culture and multiply into tens of millions requires a major suspension of disbelief,0
It requires far more proof than what is offered.Writing systemsOne of the migration thesis called the Kurgan hypothesis believes the Aryans migrated into India crossing Mesopotamia,0
Many of these groups including the Mittanis and Hittites who are closely connected to the Vedas had their own written languages, while the Vedic Indians apparently didn't,0
How come the Indo-Aryans who migrated past Mesopotamia and whose various branches developed written scripts, forget all that as they enter India? To me, it makes more sense in a reverse migration where the Vedic Indians who didn't have scripts migrated out and learnt written languages as they settled in Mesopotamia and other places creating Mittani, Kassite and Hittite kingdoms.GeneticsThis is again controversial,0
There is some evidence that Indians, Central Asians,0
 and Iranians have close relationships,0
But, we also find that the genetic distance between the various castes of north India and those of various Indian tribes and the south Indians is very, very small,0
In other words, almost all Indians [north and south] have quite close genetics regardless of this Aryan-Dravidan debate,0
Also see: Indian ancestry revealedI again accept that Indians and Central Asians do have strong links, but it is equally likely for sparsely populated Central Asians to come via more denser regions [as tribes were moved around] than a billion nation people with very close genetics to all come from a few thousand people group in 3000 years.Here is a very good paper that debunks the massive migration around 1500 BCE in a more formal way,0
Genetics and the Aryan Debate.Page on sciencedirect.comModeling of the observed haplotype diversities suggests that both Indian ancestry components are older than the purported Indo-Aryan invasion 3,500 YBP,0
What about the Horse?Various debaters in this topic beat up the dead horse,0
The apparent absence of the horse in Indus Valley seals while its copious presence is used as the key support for the Aryan Invasion Theory,0
In the recent decades far more finds of horses in India have been made,0
Although the issue is far from solved, the belief that there were no horses in the subcontinent before 2000 BCE is fading away,0
This is discussed in this book: The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture : The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate and The Horse and the Aryan Debate by Michel DaninoWhat are the alternatives?There a few other speculations.The migration happened over a long period of time - probably 1000s of years,0
This would account for India's large population and also be consistent with how the Vedic Indians didn't have written scripts while their companions in Mesopotamia and elsewhere did,0
The migration started from India instead of Central Asia,0
Indigenous Aryans,0
This is still very speculative at the moment and there are again plenty of holes in it,0
However, it would fit with the collapse of Indus Valley Civilization,0
As a massive civilization collapsed there around 1500 BCE it is possible for the millions of its inhabitants to migrate in various directions including India, West and Central Asia leading to the widespread chaos of the time,0
Those millions must have gone somewhere as the civilization collapsed,0
Page on uwf.eduSummary:The origin of Indo-Europeans in India is a controversial topic and there is no proof from either side of the debate,0
On both sides there are vested interests - one group wants to prove Hindu civilization as superior and other group bent upon proving it as inferior,0
The truth suffers inbetween.As mentioned above there are far too many holes in a major migration into India 3500 years Before Present,0
Although there is not much proof yet, my hunch is that the exodus of Indus Valley civilization was the source of Indo-European cultures,0
IVC a culture that collapsed that time and whose massive population likely migrated all around from their desertified land,0
I wish there is more research on that.Also see:Indians are not descendants of Aryans, says new study and ICHR debate on Aryan invasion theory cut short,0
 There is nothing specific about India here,0
Discussing politics is fraught with a lot of dangers both online and offline,0
Regardless of the side you are in, you will get a regular amount of garbage and harassment,0
Everyday I open my notifications, 5-6 comments fall into the abusive category,0
Some of them simple garbage like one below and others complex garbage with unprintable statements,0
Sometimes the commentors really get to the point instead of adding all those sentences around:You don't think this is harassment? It is and done by people often from leftwing in my case,0
However, I cannot generalize that to say leftwingers are harassers,0
It is just that users of all political groups harass people who don't agree to their idea.This sort of trolling is the reality regardless of the political subject you take up,0
The higher the stakes, the more venomous is this harassment,0
Thus, you might be able to get away with a controversial topic related to a small city in Croatia than say a major political topic in US,0
In religion related topics the venom can be even more severe on both sides,0
Some tips on handling this:Be reasonable: Temper your statements and be respectful in your criticisms and gracious in accepting one,0
It will not solve everything, but it will reduce the attacks,0
For instance, saying "India is s***, the nation s****" will expectedly bring back sharper comments,0
The question details fails this point #1,0
Be the solution: There are things people hold dear and when you try to abuse those things, people react bad,0
Don't fight the people practicing an idea, but just stick to the idea itself,0
Even in the idea focus on the bad features alone,0
The more specific it is, better is the response,0
Example 1: India is a shitty place for women,0
BAD Example 2: Female infanticide is rampant in places like Dharmapuri,0
We need to extend the cradle baby scheme & have stringent punishments,0
BETTER.Report & block: For some groups, politeness doesn't work,0
Shouting match doesn't work either,0
Look to use "Report" and "block" feature where real abuse is concerned,0
I block 2-3 people a day for severe abuse,0
Abuse grows proportional to the number of people you reach.Accept: The moment you are expressing a strong opinion and hoping people accept it, you are in politics,0
At the end of the day, politics is an aggressive place no matter what side you are in,0
That is a sobering and disgusting reality.,0
 They will not sue you and this won't ruin your life,1
They will likely (but not necessarily) revoke your offer though.As for other people saying that this isn't cheating, but rather you just demonstrated that you can solve business problems efficiently: Please don't listen to their justifications,1
You seem like an otherwise honest person, or at least someone who strives to be that way,1
Don't let them throw you off your ethical track.If the rules of the interview -- implicit or explicit -- were that you can't look up things during the interview, then you cheated,1
Period.Of course, in the business world, you can use Google,1
But interviewers don't ask you a question to figure out if you could solve this question in the real world,1
They ask you to derive some information about you (your depth of knowledge, your problem solving skills, etc),1
From there, they make a guess at your ability to do the work.You cheated,1
You gave them a false impression of your skills because you broke the rules.Nothing will ever remove the fact that you cheated,1
It already happened,1
The only thing you can change is whether you got your job by cheating.The question is: Do you want this new job so badly that you're willing to sit with the knowledge for the rest of your life that you kicked off your career and got ahead with dishonesty? From what you said, I believe that you're a generally honest person (perhaps even exceptionally honest) who made a mistake,1
I'd worry that you'd end up being pretty unhappy at this company as you might never really feel right in the role.The company might still decide to take you if you confess,1
Maybe,1
Or maybe they'll decide to just reinterview you,1
Or maybe you'll wind up somewhere else in the end,1
None of these are ideal situations, but at least you will have no longer gotten ahead via dishonesty,1
If you do confess, I wouldn't use the word "cheating." I would just describe the situation honestly:Although I'm really excited about the opportunities at <company>, I wanted to be honest about my interviews,1
While the interviewers asked me questions, I looked up answers online,1
I feel that this might have been a key factor in the offer decisions and I feel pretty uncomfortable about this at an ethical level,1
I worry that my use of the Internet might have made me seem more qualified than I am.This is behavior is really out of character for me, and I really regret my actions,1
That's why I wanted to let you know what had happened and see how to proceed.I expect that you will likely revoke my offer with this disclosure, and I absolutely understand that decision (much as I would be disappointed),1
Alternatively, if you'd like to give me some additional interviews, I would love that opportunity too,1
I assure you that, regardless of your decision, this will never happen again with this company or another,1
I really value ethics in my personal and professional life, and I'm really sorry that I didn't act in accordance with my own standards.I can't tell you what to do, but I can say that you'll be much prouder of yourself if you decline the offer -- even if you don't confess what you did.Good luck.,1
 Not particularly,1
I think it's good to discuss what good interview processes look like.However, I do think that many people's points are poorly thought out,1
(Then again, I think the same thing about pretty much any issue, so it hardly makes it worse here.)Many people's logic is: "Algorithm interviews are broken because of X, therefore we should all switch to Y instead." The problem is that Y is also broken in its own ways,1
All interview processes have their flaws,1
Developer Interviews are Broken, and You Can't Fix ItThe other key logical problem people make is the assumption that the interview process should mirror "real life." That's not actually true,1
The interview should assess relevant, important skills, but it doesn't need to be "real life." In other cases, many people just don't understand what the process is all about,1
They'll argue, for example, that it's ridiculous for an interviewer to expect you to write perfect code on a whiteboard,1
Well, yes, it is,1
But, generally speaking, a single bug does not lead to a rejection,1
(And if it does, then that company's implementation is very broken, but that doesn't mean that the process as a whole is broken.)I think many people's objections (or ultimate conclusions) are misinformed or just poorly thought through, but I'm not particularly tired of people making them,1
Or, at least, I'm less tired of them than I am of objections on many other issues.Now, people misspelling my name on the other hand..,1
sigh.,1
 You dont ask someone to be your friend,1
So why do you ask them to be your mentor?Think about your closest friends  or even your less close friends,1
When you asked them to be your friend, what were your terms? How often would you hang out? What would you do? What would the expectations be on each side? Oh,1
You didnt do any of that,1
You didnt ask them to be your friend,1
That would be weird,1
Plus, how would they know if they like you before they know you? Its a sort of ridiculous question to ask or answer.But somehow or other, you just became friends,1
Maybe you just fell into friendship by hanging around each other enough,1
Maybe there was something specific that connected you, like having children the same age,1
Maybe someone introduced you two because you just moved to their city,1
Somehow or other, nothingness evolved into friendship.Like friendships, mentorships  the ones that actually exist, not the ones that exist in name only  rarely start from a formal request, and certainly not from a near stranger,1
It doesnt work for mostly the same reasons,1
Its artificially trying to create a personal relationship,1
Doesnt work.Moreover, with many mentorship requests (especially those between strangers), the more junior person is often not actually committed to making it work,1
If youve never sought out my advice before, why do you think youre now going to want to regularly get it? More likely, you suddenly thought Know what I could use? A mentor,1
Your interest will likely wane.Lets be honest: neither of us are likely to follow through with this mentorship, even if we both intend to.A pretty typical mentorship request:How to Get a Mentor Without Asking for a MentorIf you want someone to be your mentor, dont ask them to be your mentor,1
Let it build (or collapse) authentically.That doesnt mean you cant seek out mentorships,1
You can, just like you can friendships,1
Theyre not all that different,1
Both are fundamentally personal relationships, even if one is forged over drinks and gossip and another over coffee and advice.To establish a mentorship: Make yourself not a stranger,1
I recognize the names of people who regularly comment on my Quora posts, who re-share my Facebook posts, and who re-tweet my tweets,1
If I feel like youre not just a total stranger, Im more likely to help you.Write well,1
No text speak or sloppy punctuation,1
I can absolutely forgive grammatical mistakes caused by being a non-native English speaker,1
But if youre adding spaces before periods or not capitalizing words (or Capitalizing random Words), thats just being lazy and unprofessional,1
If youre lazy and unprofessional, Im unlikely to try to help you professionally,1
Why bother, if youre not doing what you can to help yourself?Get to know them -- in person,1
An online connection just isnt the same,1
Make it really, really easy for the other person,1
Find out where they work or live and meet them nearby,1
Offer to buy them coffee; its not about the money,1
Its about establishing that you value their time.Be persistent  but only a little,1
I get a lot of emails and, much as I wish this werent the case, I dont respond to all of them,1
If this relationship matters to you, follow up,1
For the most part, I dont refuse to respond to emails,1
I just havent yet gotten around to yours yet (and I might never).Make them like you,1
If possible, do something for them,1
The vast majority of mentorship requests I get are from people who have read one or more of my books but havent posted a review on Amazon,1
Look, Im an author,1
Reviews are a big deal,1
If you tell me you love my book and youre asking for help from me, Im likely to think, If you love it so much, why not post a review? I recognize Im being a little unfair here  the prospective mentee probably hasnt really thought about posting a review,1
But, still, Im a lot more likely to help those who I feel are willing to help me,1
Ill feel a bit indebted to you, Im more likely to help you,1
In fact, if I even see signs that youre generally a nice and helpful person to other people, Im more likely to help you,1
I prefer to help nice people.If I know you (even a little), if I feel like youre trying to help yourself, if I feel youre a nice person, and especially if I feel a little obligated, Im a lot more likely to chat with you  especially if you make it really easy for me,1
We can see where things go from there,1
We dont need to establish terms and conditions, so please dont ask me to be your mentor.,1
 I got a 750 (out of 800),1
This is 98th percentile overall, but it's only a little above average for MBA programs like Wharton, Stanford, and Harvard,1
All three have means and medians around 720 - 730 (around 95th percentile).As I recall, I studied for two or three weeks using the booklets from Veritas Prep,1
Those are great -- definitely recommend them.I took some practice tests by hand,1
I did not take any computer adaptive tests as practice, which was a mistake,1
Some advice/comments for those preparing for the GMAT:I loved the Veritas books,1
My understanding is that they're targeted at people who are already scoring fairly well, whereas the other books are more broadly applicable.I didn't take a prep class, so I can't really speak from personal experience,1
My understanding is that they're great for people who have trouble forcing themselves to study,1
But if you are self-motivated enough to study, they aren't that useful.Take at least one computer adaptive test,1
I had never taken a computer adaptive before the real GMAT, and it threw me off a bit,1
The questions get harder the better you're doing, so you end up feeling like you're doing worse.Take the GMAT well in advance,1
I took it last minute, so it was my only shot (and fortunately I did well enough that it wouldn't hurt me, although it also wouldn't really help me),1
If you give yourself more time, you have the opportunity to retake it,1
I believe you can "hold on" to your score for up to five years, so you might want to consider taking it after you finish college or between jobs,1
This will offer you more time to study.Also: if you're applying to the top schools, don't get too hung up on your score,1
Focus on getting in the right range, but beyond that it doesn't matter that much,1
It's just one very small piece of the package,1
Your work and other experiences matter far more.,1
 Yes,1
This is pretty standard practice -- not just for interviews, but for any sort of meeting,1
The meeting is only truly scheduled when both parties agree to that specific time,1
When you give a range of times that you're available, they cannot reasonably expect you to keep the entire range open,1
By the time they respond, some of your availability might have changed,1
Therefore, they need you to reconfirm that this time works.We do the same thing socially:Alex: "Hey, want to grab dinner sometime next week? I'm free Monday, Tuesday and Thursday." Alex has no particular obligation to keep those nights open, but it's nice if Alex can.Pat: "Sure, Monday works."Pat is expected to hold Monday for dinner with Alex -- for a short period of time, until Alex confirms (or not).Alex: "Great, see you then!"Both Pat and Alex are expected to hold Monday for dinner.The event is only really scheduled once Alex has also confirmed,1
Before then, Pat is somewhat in limbo.Additionally, if Pat specifically asks for a confirmation ("Sure, is Monday good?") then it's definitely expected that Alex would need to confirm,1
This isn't redundant,1
It typically doesn't change the situation (since hopefully you are still free at that time), but it does often enough that it serves an important function.,1
 Marissa Mayer doesn't and shouldn't have to set a good example,1
But to the extent that she inadvertently does, she actually sets a wonderful example for women by choosing to take only limited leave,1
She sends a message that not all women are the same, and that babies aren't just the women's responsibility.Different Input, Different OutputSee, the thing with a choice like how much leave to take: it's a personal choice that every mother needs to make for herself,1
A mother's choice will take into account things like:her careerher financial situationher partner's careerher desire to care for newbornsher ability to hire or get helpher partner's parental leave breastfeeding decisionsher healthher baby's healthother children at homeTo impose one person's decision on another person's, when any or all of these factors are different, is not just unfair; it's illogical,1
Different input leads to different output.It's particularly illogical to generalize from Marissa Mayer to all women,1
She very likely has round the clock help just for the baby, plus additional help for other household things,1
She makes a lot of money and she's in a particularly important role,1
It's ridiculous to act like her decisions reflect anything about the expectations for, say, the typical female software developer who works for her.A Great ExampleIf you do decide to inappropriately hold her up as some sort of example for "all women", then she's actually setting a great example,1
What's important for women, for the tech industry, and for the country is sending a message that everyone is different.As a woman -- in tech -- with a young kid and another one on the way, I can say that the expectation is definitely not "oh, you must go back to work ASAP." That's the expectation on fathers.We don't need another woman sending a message that it's okay to not work, permanently or for an extended period of time,1
That's already the norm (at least within highly paid jobs),1
Society has that message, loud and clear.What the US needs to learn (again, in highly paid jobs) is that you can't generalize all women and that, yes, some women can and will go back to work immediately,1
And that choice is okay.I'm pregnant, self-employed and have several consulting clients right now,1
They assume that I'm not really going to be working for a while after I have my child,1
Of course they don't ask -- it's often seen as a no-no topic in the US -- so there's just this lingering assumption until I awkwardly bring it up,1
And that sucks, frankly.By Marissa Mayer taking limited leave, she helps clear the way for people like me who choose to make a similar choice,1
She makes my clients question their assumption that of course I'll take months off,1
That's a great thing because, you know, we're all different,1
And that's okay.Babies: Not Just for Women Anymore!Even the fact that we're asking this suggests an issue with US culture,1
How many male CEOs have had kids? Where is the "controversy" around their not taking much leave?People don't ask because it's assumed that the babies are the mom's responsibility,1
It's okay for the dad to not take much time off because, hey, he's not really that important, is he? The mom, on the other hand: the babies are for her,1
They're her responsibility, right?That's the message that's being sent when we create a "controversy" from her personal decisions, and that's horrendously unfair to both mothers and fathers,1
We need to stop denigrating the role of fathers in society and we need to stop assuming that the woman is the "primary" parent.Anyone can be the "primary" parent -- or they can even be equals!But at the end of the day, it's her choice.Ultimately, regardless of what "message" she sends, it's unfair to expect her to make a choice that is not right for her,1
It's her choice, and it's important that we respect that,1
Women (and minorities) need to have the freedom to make their own choices without being "an example" -- the same freedom we grant to straight, white males.,1
 As much as people are dismissing this question as obvious, it's actually more complicated -- or at least ambiguous.1,1
What do you want to mean by saying that you're, say, two months pregnant? I feel like that should reflect "I got pregnant two months ago." However, one could also count from the start of your last period, which is how the number of weeks counts.2,1
How many weeks are in a month? A lot of people say 4, but this isn't true,1
An average month has 4.35 weeks (365 days / 12 months per year / 7 days per week.With those two definitions agreed upon, this will compute the number of months: # months = (# weeks - 2) / 4.35.Therefore, 34 weeks is 7.36 months pregnant,1
A different set of assumption could also lead to different answers, such as:7.8 months (if pregnancy starts from the start of the last cycle and there are 4.35 weeks per month)8.5 months (if pregnancy starts from the start of the last cycle and there are 4 weeks per month)8 months (if pregnancy starts from conception and there are 4 weeks per month)Some people might even add a month to each of those, as they might not distinguish between "in the 8th month" and "8 months pregnant".Again, it's really a matter of definitions,1
The 7.36 answer corresponds most directly to how months since you got pregnant, which is logical to me,1
Some of the others lead to weird things, like saying you're 10 months pregnant on your due date.,1
 That's an interesting question.First, I'm not so sure that it's true that most adults are unvaccinated,1
Vaccination isn't a binary thing,1
An adult might have some shots but not all,1
By contrast, a kid whose parents won't vaccinate on principle are likely to have no vaccinations,1
The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.Second, even if most adults overall are behind on shots, that doesn't mean the adults you know are that behind,1
The adults I know tend to be well-educated and have good access to healthcare,1
They're more likely to have had their shots -- but they still might be refusing the shots for their [perfectly healthy] children, under a mistaken belief that these vaccines are too much for typical child's immune system to handle,1
The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.Third, an adult with insufficient immunity might still have some immunity left,1
A child with insufficient immunity was probably never immunized at all, and thus has no immunity,1
The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.Fourth, kids have naturally weaker immune systems,1
They don't have the experience fighting off diseases that adults do,1
If a kid and an adult were both exposed to the same disease, the kid would be more likely to get sick,1
The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.Fifth, kids are little Petrie dishes of diseases,1
They roll around in dirt,1
They lick tables and other kids' toys,1
They touch sticky things just because they're lying on the ground,1
They'll pick up anyone's drink and drink from it, just because it's there,1
They don't have a good sense for "eww, gross!" (they might think plenty of things are gross, but it's more likely to be broccoli than the freshly chewed gum on the bench),1
And they're around other kids who are doing the same things,1
Kids are actually more likely to be exposed to diseases,1
Adults don't generally do this kind of thing,1
The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.So you see, there are a number of rational reasons to be more concerned about a not-fully-vaccinated child than a not-fully-vaccinated adult.It's also worth noting that vaccines are not 100% effective,1
Your vaccinated child also poses a health risk to the not-fully-vaccinated child, more so than your child does to the not-fully-vaccinated adult,1
Many people dismiss this under the rationale that they chose to not get vaccinated,1
But remember: the parent chose that, not the child,1
And even unvaccinated adults don't deserve to die.That said, although the unvaccinated child is more risky than the unvaccinated adult, I suspect there's a good amount of "we blame because we can." A parent who doesn't vaccinate their child (other than for rare medical reasons) is willfully introducing a health risk to their child and other children, without their consent,1
Yes, the risk is small when it's just isolated incidents of unvaccinated children, but it's a stupid risk to take anyway,1
It also becomes quite a major risk when a larger percent of the population is unvaccinated,1
People who don't vaccinate their children are an easy group to hate, judge, and fear,1
So while unvaccinated children are riskier than unvaccinated adults, some of the "stay away from them" mentality is probably motivated by the aforementioned inclination to hate, judge and fear them.,1
 The short answer is yes.In any question of the sort "do I have to know __?", there's a trade off between:How often does it come up?How hard is it to derive it if you don't know it?How hard is it to learn it?How much of a perfectionist do you want to be?Tries are pretty easy to learn,1
If you understand trees, I could teach you the essentials of a trie in under two minutes.They also come up fairly frequently,1
The odds of you using a trie in your interview is under 50%, but it's not negligible at all.I think it's worth it to learn,1
You probably spent more time writing this question and reading my answer than it would take you to learn the basics of tries.,1
 Some celebrities are more "mockable" than others, and their costumes reflect this,1
This doesn't mean that the celebrity deserves the mocking; it just means that they have something that others like to mock.A costume of George W,1
Bush is generally there to mock him,1
People aren't dressing as him out of respect and admiration,1
They're trying to be funny,1
The costume-wearer will likely be trotting out some of his dumbest quotes.By contrast, a costume of Michael Phelps is not necessarily a "funny" costume,1
It certainly can be (particularly if the person pretends to be smoking pot), but it's very often not.Which camp does Caitlyn Jenner fall into? Will her costume be worn out of respect (or just to make a cool costume) or for the lolz? There are certainly a great number of people who respect her, either for her bravery in coming out or for her athletic accomplishments (or both),1
There are lots of others who think she's disgusting and a sin against nature, or something like that,1
And there are even more who don't really think much about her as a person, so much as a joke.I would strongly suspect that those wearing her costume will be doing it because it's funny,1
What's so funny (to them)? That she's transgender,1
That's what people are, in most or all cases, making fun of when they dress as her,1
Making fun of someone who is transgender for being transgender is offensive and hurtful to many people,1
And from the looks of it, the people who are selling the costume know this,1
They picked a man to wear the costume -- and a particularly "macho" man,1
HILARIOUS, right?That's not to say that a custom of a transgender celebrity couldn't exist respectfully -- or even non-offensively but still not "respectful",1
If we lived in a time where being transgender wasn't a "funny" thing, but just a thing, then absolutely (and we probably will live in this time),1
Or, if there were a transgender celebrity who just happened to be accepted for this but mocked for something else, then you could have a "funny" costume of him/her that wasn't inherently transphobic.Unfortunately, Caitlyn Jenner doesn't fall into this category,1
She's most strongly associated with being transgender, and she's being mocked for this,1
That's what's inspiring this costume,1
Therefore, it is innately offensive.,1
 I have a very unique first name (and, for my first name, a fairly unique spelling),1
To some of the older Quorans, it might seem fairly mainstream,1
It's not -- at least not anymore.From Everyone has a name: In 2014, there were just 7 Gayle's born and only 13 Gail's,1
Interestingly, Abigail is extremely popular -- it's the 8th most common name,1
Still, people just don't like Gayle/Gail.Fine by me,1
I've really liked having an unusual name,1
I find that it helps my career in that I can more easily brand myself,1
It's not just that search engines can more easily find me and I can get the usernames I want, although that's definitely handy,1
It's also that "Gayle" is sufficiently descriptive to point to me,1
If you're in tech and you hear someone talking about someone named Gayle, it's very likely me (or likely enough that you might ask, if you knew me),1
This would not be true if my name were, say, Sarah.For this reason, I prefer to a more unique name (although with easier spellings) for my children,1
Unfortunately, it comes with the downside of less anonymity, if that's the path one choose,1
Ah, well.If you're really concerned with anonymity, you can look for names that are unique but still have an obvious nickname that's common,1
This way your child can choose to go by this nickname if he/she doesn't like having a unique name,1
For example:Wilson is fairly unique, but your child could go by Will.Johnson is unique, but your child could go by John.Jennette is unique, but your child could go by Jen.Aliana is unique, but your child could go by Ali.Names like this offer "brandability" as the default, but the option of anonymity.,1
 For our son's first birthday, we did a book-themed party,1
We enclosed a note inside the invitation saying:There's one small requestThat won't be too hardPlease bring a book Instead of a cardWhether Cat in the Hator Winnie the PoohYou can sign the bookwith a sweet note from youA few people brought gifts as well (or instead), but most people just brought a book.I don't think anyone thought it was rude,1
It made sense, given the book theme,1
And it probably made things easier for people as they didn't have to look for an appropriate toy.,1
 I don't know how many babies were negatively affected by it,1
The number is probably a lot higher than 17, but a lot lower than other countries (as it wasn't approved in the U.S.).The articles I've read have hedged a little on the number,1
They'll usually say that only 17 babies were shown to be impacted, which is different than saying only 17 babies were impacted.Note that health and other statistics are typically difficult to compare across countries, as the methodology for reporting and labeling is different,1
A country with mandatory reporting may have a much statistic, but that doesn't mean the true number is higher,1
Additionally, some countries might be much less likely to link an outcome with a specific cause, whereas others might be pretty comfortable in saying "mom took drug, baby is deformed, therefore, drug caused deformity.",1
 You're hanging out at home and your buddy is in the other room,1
You ask him to bring you a cup of water.He walks back into the room with one of the following:Nothing at all: this is the null array.An empty cup: this is the empty list case.A cup with water: this is the non-empty list case.Now, case 1 and 2 might feel the same to you (no water for you!), but logically, they are different,1
An empty cup is obviously not the same thing as no cup at all,1
They just aren't,1
One is a cup,1
One is not.The fact that he brought you an empty cup might signal something different than nothing at all,1
For example, it might signal that he heard you but you didn't have any water.Depending on what you wanted to do with the water, it might have a very different result,1
If you wanted to, say, add a drop of red food coloring to the water to make red water, in one case the drop lands on the table and makes a giant mess, and in the other case it lands in a cup.This is the difference between an empty list and no list at all,1
In some cases it might have the same implications, but in other cases it does not.,1
 Many people do tell friends and family their name choice at first -- and then they learn their lesson,1
Revealing the name in advance can only hurt them,1
I generally avoid doing things that will only hurt me and won't help me; don't you?Look, if I tell you my favorite name, one of a few things will happen:You'll tell me that you love the name,1
Whew! But nothing's changed now,1
I don't really like the name any more than I did before, nor have you influenced me,1
I'm glad that you like it, but this wasn't really a value-add exchange of information.You'll tell me that it's too {common, unusual, hard to spell, easily confused with another name, black, WASPy, hispanic, old-fashioned, trendy},1
Um, okay..,1
so you don't like my name choice because it's unusual, but that's part of why I like it,1
Again, no value-add, but it was value-subtract,1
Now I know you don't like the name.You'll tell me that you don't like it because that one jerk you know has the same name,1
That is obviously meaningless in terms of the general quality of the name, but it's still a value-subtract,1
Now I know you don't like the name.In other words, your opinion is basically worthless,1
Your criteria are either stupid or different than mine,1
So let's review,1
If I tell you the name I've picked, I walk into one of two scenarios:Best case: no change / mild relief,1
Worst case: walking around with the knowledge that you don't like my baby's name -- and possibly even turning me off the name enough that I need to choose a new name.It's a no-brainer: Keep the name a secret,1
Only tell those you know will happily lie about how much they like the name.After the baby is born, people are considerably more tactful because, hey, what's done is done,1
They realize it's harmful to say they don't like the name,1
So they stay quiet and, often, eventually come to like the name.Note: If someone tells you their name picks, the correct response is "I love it!",1
 I've helped coach a number of teams through the Google acquisition process (as well as many other companies),1
It is quite common to require these interviews,1
It depends on whether it's a talent acquisition (acquihire) or a product/user acquisition,1
The closer it is to a talent acquisition the more likely that Google will interview the team as part of the "technical due diligence" process.This actually makes quite a bit of sense,1
If they're acquiring your company as a way to get engineers, doesn't it make sense that they'd want to assess the quality of those engineers in the same way they hire their own?Employees who underperform in these interviews are not brought on as part of the acquisition ("fired" as you might say, but it's not truly being fired),1
If too many people do poorly, the acquisition just won't happen at all.,1
 An "unlimited" (within the first year) parental leave policy might not be as good as it sounds.It's understandable that people are excited about this,1
It seems like a good thing,1
It's equal across mothers and fathers; that sends a nice message that babies are not just the woman's responsibility,1
I think all parental leave should be equal,1
The flexibility offered through it is nice as well, since not every parent wants to leave full-time.However, I'm deeply concerned about how it will actually play out.From what I've heard, when companies offer "unlimited" vacation or sick leave, employees actually take less time off,1
The reasoning is that the time isn't considered yours, free to spend as you see fit,1
You also now have to worry about how you're perceived,1
Will taking X weeks off be considered excessive?Facebook, for example, offers four months fully paid to both men and women,1
That's very generous (by US standards, especially for fathers) and it's equal,1
Men and women both know that four months off is absolutely reasonable in the company's eyes.Netflix didn't state their policy as one-year of parental leave,1
No,1
That would be quite different (and very admirable).They say it's "unlimited" (within the first year),1
Now parents need to worry about what's truly acceptable,1
One year might be normal in other countries (where, notably, leave is typically paid for by the government and not by company), but it's not normal in the US,1
You probably won't see a lot of people taking one year just because they can, just as you probably don't see people at Netflix taking three month vacations under their "unlimited vacation" policy.People have to figure out what's acceptable, and that might well mean erring towards the more limited six-week leaves that other companies offer.And, what's worse, this might impact men more than women,1
Many people (erroneously) don't feel like men "need" much leave, so men might feel expected to come back to work earlier.Netflix's intention was likely quite good, especially as this is inline with how they offer vacation and sick leave,1
However, the actual impact might be quite bad.It'd be far more powerful if they had explained the policy as one-year of leave, for men and women,1
That's technically the same thing, but sends a very different message.,1
 A lot of people value uniqueness in a name,1
There can be several reasons for this, including:Emotional: My kid is so special that I want him/her to have a special name,1
He/she shouldn't be just like all the other kids.Practical: It's annoying to be one of five Johns in your class,1
Many parents don't want to put their kids through that,1
Strategic: Some believe it's beneficial for your career to have a unique name,1
It's believed (by them) to be easier to make a name for yourself if your name is actually unique.Many are relating to their own experiences in this,1
For my kids, I prefer names that are unique but easy to say and spell,1
Why? Because I like that my name is very unique, but the unique spelling is annoying,1
So that's what I pick names based on,1
I want a name that's uncommon enough that he'd rarely meet anyone with that name, but still easy to spell and sounds like a normal name.Interestingly, if you listen to what people complain about with these "unique" names, it's often not about uniqueness or spelling or even newness.Uniqueness: Nevaeh was the 65th most common name, and it's was as high as 25 a few years ago,1
(A comparison point: in 1985, the 65th most common name was Catherine, with Cynthia at #66.)Spelling: Precious is very easy to spell,1
So is Apple.Newness: Hudson doesn't get nearly so much hate,1
And yet, it's quite a new name and very "trendy."Know what name is unique and hard to spell? Gayle,1
There were just 7 Gayle's born in 2014 in the US (and 13 Gail's),1
You think that's a ridiculous name too, right? Oh,1
You don't,1
(You probably just think it's old sounding.)So, what is the real objection here? Why do these names seem weird? Because:You're not a baby,1
They were weird 20+ years ago, but that doesn't mean they're weird now,1
The names just seem so..,1
black,1
Very often, the names that people complain about are ones that are associated with black people,1
Names with equivalent popularity/trends that aren't "black names" don't get nearly as much hatred,1
(You might not have been consciously thinking this -- I doubt you were,1
But I'll bet if you presented people with two equally popular names and with equal trends, one that sounds "black" and one that sounds "WASPy", they'll much prefer the WASPy one.)To summarize: Many people value uniqueness in a name, for a variety of justifiable (and some silly) reasons,1
Others look down on those choices, especially when it doesn't match their age/racial culture.,1
 No.There are many reasons why unplanned pregnancies happen,1
Lack of access to contraception.Contraception failing.Rape and/or abuse.Being told that you're infertile.Using contraception incorrectly.In addition, there are reasons why someone might want an abortion, even in a planned pregnancy (for example, fetal and maternal issues).These things happen, but let's be honest,1
The number one reason for an unplanned pregnancy that leads to an abortion is just people being irresponsible by not using contraception and then deciding they don't want kids.Should they be able to access abortions, despite their stupidity? Why on earth not?Pregnancy is hard -- really hard,1
It sucks even when you want to have a kid, and I can't imagine how much worse it'd be if you don't want to,1
Raising a child (or giving up a child up for adoption) is even harder,1
These are not reasonable "punishments" for a couple's irresponsibility,1
I don't want to force a woman to go through pregnancy and then adoption/child-raising just because she was irresponsible.In fact, do you really want the woman who was repeatedly irresponsible and doesn't want a baby to be forced to raise a child?,1
 While I understand where you're coming from, no, it's not re-writing history,1
In fact, it'd be frankly weird to not update the pronouns,1
This is essentially how we handle everything else,1
People say "Gayle McDowell worked at Google",1
But McDowell is my married name, and I was "Gayle Laakmann" the entire time I was at Google.Someone might say "I met my husband at my friend's 25th birthday party," but at the time he wasn't her/his husband,1
Names and pronouns are just "pointers" to the person,1
They typically reflect the current name and pronoun, not the name or pronoun at the time,1
I am not inherently Gayle McDowell; I am me and people happen to refer to me as Gayle McDowell.Convention is to use the current pointer, not the then-pointer (probably because the pointer is designed to be useful, and using an out-of-date one isn't so useful),1
It'd be quite strange to break from convention specifically to use a transgender person's "original" sex.Additionally, for many transgender people, their original name/pronoun reflects a painful time in their life,1
They might not want to be reminding of this time themselves,1
They might also not want to "out" themselves to others.Given that convention is to use the original pointer and the pain it would cause to not, it seems pretty evident that we should use the current pronoun.Of course, if a specific transgender person has a different preference, go with that,1
Even if it doesn't fit the "standard." This impacts them far more than you.,1
 Obviously I applied topological sort to a graph of the dependencies across sections and chapters.First, there was the decision about which chapters and sections to include,1
Second, I had to draw a directed graph and connected nodes where one should be discussed before the other, either due to a dependency in the material or a difference in complexity,1
Third, I applied a simple topological sort to determine a linear ordering,1
There's some randomness to it too.Sections"Introductory Material" obviously needs to be before anything else."Solutions" obviously needs to be after the questions themselves,1
"Data Structures" needs to be before "Algorithms", since they're less complex and the algorithm questions often depend on knowledge of data structures."Assorted Review Problems" needs to be after all the other questions.So you get this graph for the sections:Applying a topological sort to this, you get the order in the book.ChaptersWithin Data Structures, "Arrays" needs to be before anything else, as it's the most fundamental,1
It makes sense to me to discuss linked lists before stacks and queues or trees, since linked lists are more basic than either of those.Within "Algorithms", there isn't a lot of dependency,1
"Recursion and Dynamic Programming" should be before "Sorting", since sorting uses recursion.Within "Knowledge Based", C++ and Java should be discussed adjacent to each other and before Databases.Within "Assorted Review Problems", moderate problems should obviously be discussed before hard problems.So then I just applied a straightforward topological sort to get a linear ordering.I presume this is the standard algorithm for all authors to decide chapter ordering..,1
right?Okay, fine, I didn't really draw this out,1
But something like this was roughly in my head,1
Certain topics were dependent on others, and certain topics were just less complex and should be discussed earlier,1
A lot of chapters, especially within algorithms, could be discussed in any order.,1
 Talk to him/her as much as possible,1
Don't use baby words unless you want him to learn baby words.Point out some simple objects: ball, mama, dada, etc.Listen carefully to what they say,1
They may be speaking in their own language,1
My son calls buses "ma" (no one knows why),1
It's not a real word, but it's his word,1
It counts! You don't need to use their makeup words with them, but you should respond as though they're saying the real thing.When they start being able to speak a bit, avoid yes/no questions ("Do you want to read a book?") and use either/or questions instead ("Do you want to play with the car or the spoon?"),1
This forces them to speak a little more while pushing their limits a bit.Push two word phrases,1
Teach them "more" and then "food." Once they have those, encourage them to put the two together to say "more food." Play dumb a bit, like you don't know what they want more of,1
As they develop their language skills, continue to push their abilities a bit and play dumb,1
Make them need to use their words to get the things they want.,1
 If you actually performed poorly and your interviewer said that, he/she would be a jerk,1
It would be a bad sign, but mostly because you had an interview where you didn't do well and because you had an interviewer who was a jerk.But, honestly, I find it quite unlikely that your interviewer said this if you didn't do well,1
It's FAR more likely that in fact you only think you did poorly.See: Why Your Interview Performance is Impossible to Judge (More relevant for software engineering roles, but applicable regardless.)So, really, what you have is this question: Is it a good sign or a bad sign if your interviewer says "I hope the rest of your interviews go as well as this"? That indicates that you most likely did well and your interviewer really liked you,1
That's a great sign!,1
 The design is important to the extent that it affects the ability to easily grab the highlights and other essential content from your resume,1
Few recruiters would judge you (at least consciously) on the design of your resume, unless design skills are important for your job function.As far as the "CareerCup template": there's nothing special about it,1
It's just a boring, normal template,1
It's designed to be able to fit a good amount of content on it and to make it easy to see the key details (job titles, companies, etc),1
It was right for me,1
It might not be right for you.I dislike templates for me with my experience which use the entire left column to just have headlines like "EXPERIENCE" and "EDUCATION",1
Sure, it looks pretty,1
But it wastes so much space.I dislike templates for me with my experience which don't adequately highlight the company names,1
My resume highlight was company names,1
I needed reviewers to be able to skim my resume and say, "Wow, she worked at Microsoft and Apple,1
Let's interview her." Frankly, that's really all I needed to land any interview,1
That's probably not your situation though,1
If your company names actually reflect poorly on you, then you might want to hide your company names and instead highlight your job titles,1
Formatting like item below is harmful to me but potentially beneficial to you.Software Engineer, Company Name (City, ST), June 2010 - June 2015I don't care if a template includes the cities of each job,1
Many people needs this in their resume,1
I didn't.I don't want to highlight specific skills (languages, software, etc), but it does need to be on my resume somewhere.I wanted a one page resume,1
Short resumes help the highlights jump out,1
Long resumes end up with some great things pushed to the next page, or just lost in a bunch of other weaker items.So these were (some of) the criteria used to design this: This is what a GOOD resume should look likeIt's an okay template for many people, but there's nothing special about it,1
It's just a normal, boring template,1
It was designed to fit my needs,1
Those probably aren't the same as yours, but they might be close enough,1
Or not.The major thing you should ask it what the selling points of your experience is,1
Pick a few things that you think will be the keys to landing an interview,1
Is it a job title? A company you worked for? A project? An award? Your school? Pick a template that allows those to stand out on your resume.,1
 This will not pose an issue with Google or with the vast majority of tech companies in the U.S,1
In the U.S., the law is that a company cannot discriminate on the basis of physical disability if you would be able to perform the job with or without reasonable accommodation,1
(And the bar for "reasonable" goes pretty far.)I don't even see a reason to mention it to your recruiter,1
So you have to get up every 30 minutes? Most people get up and walk around periodically,1
No big deal.There's no accommodation they need to know of, so no reason to mention it.,1
 Maybe, maybe not.1,1
Is this a good question?I can't really comment on the problem as it's not clear what the problem means.Many people have interpreted the problem to mean flipping left and right,1
In this case, it's a pretty uninteresting trivial problem,1
It's a bad question, unless maybe early on in the process, because it doesn't really demonstrate much,1
It's easy,1
(And I would be somewhat concerned about someone who couldn't do it.)However, the OP later says that it was "to min-max a tree, ascending to descending",1
I don't really understand what this means,1
Max Howell on Twitter2,1
Was he rejected because of this question?It's also unclear why he was rejected,1
Was he specifically told that he was rejected because he couldn't invert a binary tree on the whiteboard? If he had multiple interviews (which is likely, since he was brought onsite), does he know that it was that interview that led to his rejection? If he did know it was that interview, how does he know why he was rejected? Usually recruiters don't provide that information.Perhaps it had nothing to do with his technical performance and was in fact his communication skills.In my experience, a candidate's assumptions about their performance has no correlation with their actual performance,1
He might have very strong beliefs about why he was rejected, but unless he was specifically told, I don't really put much faith in it.3,1
Why was he rejected?If it was his technical performance on this question that led to his rejection, it's still not quite true that he was rejected because he simply "can't invert a binary tree on a whiteboard."Interviews aren't graded on a binary basis,1
It's not like, "Oops, you can't do X, so I'm going to reject you."More accurately, if it was this interview question that led to his rejection, he was rejected because he performed worse on this question relative to other candidates,1
That is, other candidates who tackled the same problem with the same interviewer demonstrated stronger problem-solving/coding skills than he did,1
It's very much feasible to perform better than other candidates on this problem (whatever it is),1
He just didn't.4,1
Was he a false negative?Yes, the interview process is flawed,1
There are false positive (bad candidates who are accepted) and there are false negatives (good candidates who are rejected).Was he a false negative? We don't really know,1
Maybe,1
He's certainly done some excellent work, but that doesn't mean he would perform well in Google's environment,1
Just because you're great in one environment doesn't,1
 mean you'll perform well in all.5,1
Should you hire on past experience?You might argue that, despite poor performance (relative to other candidates), he should still be hired because of his prior experience,1
I'm somewhat sympathetic to that view, but it can also present a dangerous slippery slope,1
How widely do you start making exceptions because someone has great prior experience? How do you roll out such a policy at a large company without letting the bar slip to more marginal cases?It's worth noting that, in the vast majority of cases, you can't hire based on someone's prior experience,1
You can only hire based on how someone discusses it,1
It's hugely subjective and very coachable,1
In a "hire on prior experience" process:There are lots of false negatives because candidates don't know how to discuss their prior experience,1
There are lots of false positive because candidates are able to trump up (sometimes even lie) about what they've done in the past.There are lots of people who are brilliant and would do great work given the right opportunities and mentorship, but haven't gotten that opportunity yet,1
Google's process can identify those people,1
Many people don't classify those situations as a false negatives since those people haven't in fact accomplished much,1
I think that's a mistake,1
You care about what they'll do for you, not what they've done in the past.It's also circular logic, since it's saying that hiring based on prior experience justifies rejecting based on a lack of it,1
If so, then doesn't hiring based on whiteboard problem-solving skills justify rejecting based on lack of those?Hiring based on prior experience comes with its own set of issues (and its own advantages).6,1
Does it work for Google?As far as if it works for Google: well, let's look at it this way,1
Virtually every "elite" tech company (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Airbnb, Dropbox, Palantir, etc.) has built its team of software engineers through this process,1
Unless you're going to argue that a randomly selected group of programmers could have built systems like the ones at those companies, the interview process can't be that bad,1
Somehow, it's selecting reasonably good people, even if it rejects some good people and hires some bad ones (and even if there's a better way of doing it).This is not to say that Google's process is perfect,1
It's not,1
But all interview processes are broken in their own ways,1
The key is to find the one that's least broken for your company.Developer Interviews are Broken, and You Can't Fix It,1
 "Shameful"? Yikes!Even so: No, it won't be released on the same day,1
It's not really possible.The way that the book is printed in India is different from the US,1
In order to make the book affordable in India prices, I have to do bulk print runs,1
It takes time -- an unpredictable amount of time -- to get that ramped up,1
The printer also isn't quite as tightly integrated with Amazon and Flipkart (through no fault of theirs),1
That also causes a delay as books have to actually be shipped to a warehouse.By contrast, in the US, when I say "go", it's available that day or the next day.I suppose I could just arbitrarily hold up the US release until it's released in India, but that doesn't help anyone.,1
 I've definitely heard (frequently) of interviewers selecting questions from Cracking the Coding Interview.However, they shouldn't,1
When I do interviewing training, I specifically tell companies not to.First, questions in the book are there not because they're necessarily good questions, but because they're useful for candidates to prepare with,1
The correlation between is strong, but not perfect,1
For example, brainteasers are in the book even though I don't recommend asking them.Second, and much more importantly, it's stupid to ask questions from the same book that candidates are largely using,1
The point of problem-solving questions is to see how candidates solve new problems that they haven't seen before.,1
 I don't actually have control over that, interestingly,1
I set a list price on Amazon, but then Amazon can (and does) arbitrarily drop the price.The list price for the 5th edition is $39.95, but Amazon sells it for $30.05 (right now).The list price for the 6th edition (on pre-order right now) is $39.95, but Amazon has just dropped the price to $27.64,1
I don't have any control over this; it just happens.So in other words, the price could be anything from $21 to $40 at any given point,1
On pre-order though, the price is "guaranteed" in that you pay the lowest price as the price varies.Cracking the Coding Interview: Gayle McDowell: 9780984782857: Amazon.com: Books,1
 I typically vote as a democrat,1
More specifically:I lean much more strongly democrat on most social issues (gay rights, transgender rights, black and minority rights, women's rights, gun rights, healthcare, immigration, religious involvement in politics, assisted suicide, etc).I think the increasing disparity between the wealthy and poor is problematic,1
I'm concerned about the shrinking middle class,1
Democrats seem more focused on this issue,1
I somewhat side with republicans on some economic ideas (for example, the value of being fiscally conservative), but I don't think they have actually executed effectively on this.While democrats have elected their share of stupid people, Republicans seem to take the cake here,1
Their adherence to religion probably has something to do with it,1
(This is not at all saying that religious people are stupid,1
It's that screaming the loudest about God seems to be a winning strategy for Republicans,1
That's taking the focus off more important things, like good decision making.)To put this another way: I'm somewhat torn between the two sides,1
I could be willing to go against my values and vote republican if there were very strong evidence that Republicans were better for the economy (after all, the economy also has life and death impact for people),1
But that evidence isn't there yet, and thus I would generally vote democrat.,1
 When I was in college, I TAd for a freshman/sophomore level computer science class,1
All the TAs were prior students in the class,1
We had by far the best set of TAs in the Computer Science department.Is that surprising? We surely had much less experience than the other TAs, who were usually PhD students,1
We didn't have the expertise in the subject area that the PhD students had.But here's the thing: We were great teachers,1
We were selected not because we were knowledgable in the material (although we had to of course do reasonably well in the class), but because we could effectively communicate it.They knew we could effectively communicate it because they'd just spent a year interacting with us and watching how we communicate,1
That's so much better than an interview.We'd just taken the class, so we knew what people struggled with,1
We could communicate it at their level because we were still at their level,1
We wouldn't try to explain things with concepts beyond their understanding.When a true subject-matter expert teaches something, he/she often communicates in a way that is too complex.You want your teachers to be great teachers, first and foremost,1
Experts absolutely have their role,1
You need an expert to set up the curriculum and to tackle some of the more difficult questions,1
But you don't need to be taught by experts at all times.I don't think it's that different at a coding bootcamp,1
You certainly want experts to be very involved,1
But prior students who really stood out in their communication skills could make excellent teachers,1
They can communicate the complex topics in a way that might just make more sense to a current student.,1
 I think what's disrespectful is to presume, with zero knowledge of the parent or child or situation, that we know better than them,1
Here's the entirety of our knowledge:Someone had a bumper sticker that said "Please be patient, autistic child on board."That's it,1
We presume that this was on a car,1
We presume that this was the parent,1
We presume that the kid doesn't want their condition known,1
We presume that the kid is able to even understand what this bumper sticker says,1
We presume that this was done with no reasonable justification,1
We presume that we know better although we know nearly nothing.Try this: When you see a parent doing something that you don't get, ask yourself, "Is there a plausible explanation for this behavior?"For pretty much anyone with kids, someone could look at a parenting choice and say that it's a bad one,1
Usually, when you know the situation though, it seems a lot more reasonable.Two examples from my personal experience:For much of my child's life, I've carefully tracked his calories,1
I don't give him food just because he asks for it,1
I ration food that many parents would consider fairly healthy (eggs, whole wheat bread, milk, fruit, etc).The parenting books say that you should let your kid eat whenever they're hungry and that those are healthy choices,1
Kids know how to control their appetite,1
Yes, that's true in most situations,1
Lots of people have told me that I don't need to worry so much about what my kid eats.But my kid will overeat into obesity and those foods, while healthy in many respects, are very high in calories.I have a friend who really pushes her kid to eat,1
She's practically force-feeding her kid,1
That's a big no-no in the parenting books,1
But her kid will, if left to his own, eat so little that he'll be unhealthily skinny and deprived of sufficient calories to grow healthy.We don't know what is going on in this situation, but I can certainly imagine situations where it'd be better to disclose this child's autism publicly than to not,1
Perhaps it makes other people more tolerant of the child's situation and less likely to do things that upset the child (honking, yelling, etc),1
Perhaps this parent tends to have trouble getting the child in and out of parking spots,1
Perhaps this is a vehicle used to transport severely autistic children and, again, they got a lot of hassle before putting this on.Remember that when you ask if a parent should do something, the question is about that parent, not all or even most parents,1
Most parents shouldn't ration food, but we should,1
Most parents shouldn't force-feed their kids, but my friend should,1
Most parents shouldn't use such a bumper sticker, but this parent -- if it even is a parent -- quite possibly should,1
The parent did this for a reason, remember,1
Why assume they're wrong when we know absolutely nothing?Give people the benefit of the doubt,1
Don't be so judgmental about other people's choices.,1
 Yes, it is in the works,1
It should be released June or July 2015,1
You can sign up to be notified (or just find out more details) at Cracking the Coding Interview, v6 | Coming SoonWhen I wrote the 5th edition about four years ago, I had a ton of interview experience but not as much coaching experience,1
Now, particularly through doing acquisition/acquihire coaching, I have a lot more,1
And, I have more experience with coaching the same people repeatedly,1
I have developed a bunch of new techniques and have been able to refine them by seeing what really works,1
This has motivated a lot of the changes.What's new?This is a huge expansion,1
You know that thing that many professors do, where they create a new "edition" that's not substantially different but forces you to buy a new version? I don't believe in doing that,1
This is actually a huge change (as was the 4th->5th edition).Some of the biggest changes:It's about 70% longer,1
The 5th edition was 500 pages,1
The 6th is (well, was) about 850,1
I actually hit the printing limit (800 pages), so I had to change the page size,1
(It's like college all over again...)It has 39 more problems,1
I took out a few problems I didn't really like, so there are probably more like 45 more problems.Hints! I'm really excited about this,1
I think this will be incredibly valuable,1
It will help you simulate the interview experience more and develop better techniques, since interviewers give you hints too,1
Each problem has an average of 5 or so hints (2 or 3 for some of the easiest problems), and more than 10 for some of the hardest,1
The hints for each problem are incremental,1
Try to solve the problems without the hints, but if you need them--use as few as possible,1
New strategies / techniques,1
I've done a lot of interview coaching over the past two or three years,1
There are a lot of trends and techniques that I see now that I never noticed before,1
They've even helped me to solve some of the harder problems,1
:)Lots of Big O,1
When I wrote the 5th edition, I don't think I realized how many people struggled with big O,1
Turns out..,1
the vast majority of candidates don't understand it well enough for an interview (even those who think they do),1
I have a huge section on big O now,1
In addition, many of the existing problems have been reworked or rewritten - fixing errors in some cases, clarifying things, adding new solutions/approaches, etc.Programming LanguageI have continued to use Java for this book for a few reasons,1
First, Java is more widely readable than Python,1
Pretty much everyone has written Java or a language much like it,1
Second, while I love Python as a language because it makes some things so easy (for example, doing a quick map or reduce), that makes solutions in Python a little less broadly applicable,1
I want this book to be as language agnostic as possible,1
The point is the algorithms, not the code.Third, for the purposes of this book, having explicit typing makes it easier for people to understand what's going on,1
It removes some of the ambiguity when reading written code,1
However, you can view or contribute solutions in other languages at gaylemcd/ctci.,1
 Your mom might not be going about it the right way (or maybe she is--we don't really know), but either way she has a point,1
I would encourage you to not brush it off entirely.Whether you like it or not, attractiveness makes your life easier,1
You'll make friends easier,1
People will think you're smarter,1
Teachers and strangers will like you more,1
You'll get treated better.These aren't just little things about how people see you,1
These are very real,1
Your friendships matter,1
Your grades matter,1
Your career matters,1
All of things come a bit easier when you're attractive and know how to put yourself together well.You're writing off caring about your appearance as superficial, but..,1
is all this superficial? Having friends? Grades? Career? Certainly many people go to excess here and care too much about their appearance,1
People can also care too much about their grades or too much about making friends,1
The fact that some people over focus isn't a reason to not care.What concerns me with your attitude is that you're just saying it doesn't matter to you, and I'm not sure you've thought through the implications of this,1
Additionally, given your age, there could be other factors at play,1
Perhaps you say you don't care about your appearance because you think it's hopeless,1
Or perhaps you think it takes too much effort,1
Or perhaps you don't want to enter into competition with your sisters,1
Or perhaps you want to feel superior over others and call them superficial.As I said, there's a lot of value in knowing how to put yourself together well,1
I would encourage you to find a way that works for you,1
Perhaps drop the sweatpants for stretchy skinny jeans (which can be much more comfortable, surprisingly, than normal jeans),1
Find some comfortable but fitted tops,1
Find makeup that works for your skin, even if you don't wear it everyday.If you do decide that you really don't want to care about your appearance, recognize what you're giving up,1
You're giving up something that will help you in many parts of life,1
It's okay to not leverage that advantage, just like it's okay to not leverage your network for a job search and it's okay to not work hard in school,1
You don't always have to take the "smart" path.Just make your decisions for you (not to spite anyone else) and with a full understanding of the consequences.,1
 Let's look at this from several aspects: correctness, readability, and style.CorrectnessIt's not actually technically correct,1
It's close and would only require minor tweaks to fix.First, you've implemented this extra little bit that isn't in the problem,1
If there's only one character of a particular type, you just insert that character (instead of the character + the frequency),1
That's actually not the assignment.Second, the problem requires that if the compressed string would be longer than the original string, you should return the original string,1
You haven't done this,1
This is the primary reason why the book's code is "longer": it's actually solving a different problem,1
If you strip this part out of the book's code, it's actually shorter and simpler than your code.If you make this change, there are two ways of doing it,1
You could check in advance (and save yourself the memory usage) or you can check after you've done the compression,1
You can debate which approach is better, and it depends on what assumptions you have,1
The book checks in advance, on the reasoning that if you really need to compress a string, then you potentially throwing long strings at it,1
It's nice to save yourself the memory usage.(Additionally, if your interviewer adds this constraint to the problem, then they may be looking for something beyond just throwing in an if-statement at the end.)ReadabilityYou've used nested loops where the inner loop modifies the outer loop,1
Yuck,1
It makes it look like you have an O(N^2) algorithm, even when you don't, and makes the flow of the program confusing.If you are going to do this, I'd actually rather you use not use "i" as the iterating variable on the loops,1
People usually use "i" when it's something very straightforward, like just looping through this,1
It has an implication of "ignore this variable -- it's not terribly important." Something like "index" would probably be better here.Avoid that when possible -- and it's definitely possible here,1
You can do this with just one linear loop forward,1
That's how the code in the book works.Style & other minor issuesFix your spacing,1
There should be a space after "for", "while", and "if".Be consistent,1
You can debate whether or not you should have spaces around comparisons (equals, less than, etc), although virtually every style guideline I'm aware of requires them,1
But if you really argue that you don't want them, then you should be consistent here,1
You have spaces sometimes, but not always ("i<input.length();").You declare the StringBuffer in the beginning, but then you have a (potential) return right after it,1
Why not just put the StringBuffer declaration after it?There's no reason to have the bulk of your code wrapped within an else statement,1
It's okay to do one-line if statements (actually, I don't love them, but I use them in the book for compactness), but don't mix a one-line if statement with a multiline else block.The first if-statement is actually,1
 totally unnecessary,1
I'd take it out.Given that you're using a StringBuffer, I don't see the benefit of concatenating a string first and then inserting the string,1
That will create a new string,1
I would just add the strings individually.Clean up time!First, I'll fix the style issues,1
I'm also going to put opening braces on the same line,1
This is my personal preference and the style that both Google and Facebook use,1
It's very much just personal preference; don't let anyone tell you it's bad to do otherwise,1

It's not actually strictly necessary,1

 It depends on how core that built-in library is to the essence of the question,1
Generally, you shouldn't replace the essence of the interview question with a built-in library,1
So writing array.sort() when I ask you to sort an array would be defeating the point of the problem (which is to see how elegant your code is).But, if your solution merely relied on the array being sorted but it wasn't really the point of the question, then please do use the built-in library.That said, it's sort of an irrelevant question,1
If you're approaching questions the right way, then this doesn't really come up as an issue.First, you should be discussing the problem with your interviewer before you start coding,1
You shouldn't just code as soon as you think you have a solution to the problem,1
This would be the point to mention that there's a built-in library that handles the problem.Second, when you code, you should approach it top-down, not bottom-up,1
Start with the most high level function and then fill in the details as you go,1
This ensures that you get the most important algorithmic parts done first,1
If you do things this way, it won't really matter whether or not you can use the built-in library functions,1
Use them--and make up your own functions as you need,1
You can fill in the details as you have time.,1
 No, certainly not.Let's make sure we're very clear on this point (because a lot of people don't really get this),1
The letter "n" is in O(n) is a variable that has a specific meaning,1
It's not a magic letter used for runtimes.An example: is inserting a value in a balanced binary search tree O(N) or O(log N)? Both are valid answers; it depends what N means.If N reflects the number of nodes in the tree, then insertion takes O(log N).If N reflects the depth of the tree, then insertion takes O(N).When someone something like "binary search in an array is O(log N)", they're being slightly imprecise,1
We all know that they mean that N is the size of the array (what else could it mean?), so we don't get too bothered by it,1
But technically, they should define the meaning of N.Given this, nested for loops are not necessarily O(N^2),1
Here are some examples:Example 1: O(A*W) and/or O(N)This code counts the number of a's in an array of words.1
2
3
4
5
6
array = array of words (where all words have the same length)count_of_As = 0for each word in array: for each character in word: if character == 'a': count_of_As += 1This is an O(A * W), where A is the length of the array and W is length of each word,1
You could, however, say it's O(N), where N is the number of characters in all the words, combined.You absolutely cannot say that it's O(N^2), because what would N mean? (Okay, there are some bizarre things you could define N to be,1
For example, if you defined N to be the square root of the number of characters in all the words,1
That'd be a very strange definition of N.)Example 2: O(N^4)This code builds a string of pairs of elements.1
2
3

6
array = array of charactersstr = ""for x in array: for y in array: pair_to_string = "(" + x + ", " + y + ")" str += pair_to_stringLots of people will want to say this is O(N^2), where N is the length of the array,1
Not so.Concatenating K characters together (naively, in most languages) actually takes O(K^2) time,1
A very simple explanation of this is that you're continuously creating a new string,1
The first time you create a string of size 1, then size 2, then size 3, then size 4,1
The total number of characters allocated O(K^2), which will take O(K^2) time.(I'm excluding times when the compiler might do some optimization, which is possible, or when the language does something fancier,1
This is a simple, naive example.)So if concatenating K characters together is K^2 time, then concatenating N^2 small strings together will be O((N^2)^2) time, or O(N^4),1
.Example 3: O(N)This code counts the number of sequences of 5 characters that are the same.1

array = array of intscount_5_the_same = 0for i from 0 to array.length - 4: all_the_same = true for j = i + 1 to i + 4: if array[i] != array[j]: all_the_same = false if all_the_same: count_5_the_same += 1This code takes O(N) time, where N is the length of the array.Example 4: O(N^2 log N)This code counts how many times the product of two integers within a sorted array is within the array,1

array = array of intscount_product_occurrences = 0for x in array: for y in array: product = x * y if binary_search(array, product): count_product_occurrences += 1This code will take O(N^2 log N) time,1
That's because the for loops go through O(N^2) iterations, and each iteration does an O(log N) search.There are an infinite number of examples like this,1
Perhaps you feel like these examples are cheating or bending the rules of the question,1
Maybe..,1
if you define the question to be as follows: Are all nested for loops O(N^2) where:The outer for loop iterates O(N) timesThe inner for loop iterates O(N) times, for each iteration of the for loopThe outer for loop only does O(1) work, other than the inner for loopThe inner for loop only does O(1) work.In that case, yes, those should be all O(N^2),1
(Or at least, I can't think of any counter examples, but it's possible I'm missing some additional qualifications.)The important take-away here is to realize that nothing is ever inherently O(N) or O(N^2),1
N is just a variable and it always has a very specific meaning (although sometimes we infer what it is),1
Big O is just an equation of variables that reflects the runtime,1
That equation can be anything and can use any variables.In fact, if you're struggling even a little bit with big O (and even if you're not, this can't hurt): just stop using N as a variable in big O,1
Seriously,1
Use logical variable names instead that reflect their meaning.Too many people say "O(N)" when they really mean "linear",1
Well, linear in what? If you have an array of [equal-length] strings, it's really not clear whether your "N" refers to the array or the string length, or something else,1
Avoiding N as a variable name will prevent you from making a stupid mistake like this: Sorting a string takes O(N log N) time,1
So if you have an array of strings and you want to sort all of them, it takes O(N*N log N),1
Uh..,1
nope,1
Different Ns,1
Try again, using S for the string length and A for array length.,1
 As I understand it, the connection you're making is this: a boy being sexually abused and then turning out to be gay indicates that sexual orientation can be changed,1
Therefore, since it can be changed, we shouldn't oppose "gay conversion therapies."This is misguided on a number of levels.A data point of 1,1
Many boys being abused wind up being straight too,1
So finding out an abused boy is gay indicates nothing about how changeable sexual orientation is.Gay conversion therapy is opposed because it's harmful, not because it's ineffective,1
Gay conversation therapies aren't opposed because they're ineffective,1
Many things are ineffective yet don't earn the amount of hatred that conversion therapies do,1
Gay conversion therapy is despised because it's harmful and often done on a child without their consent, during a particularly vulnerable point in their life,1
We should oppose this even if it did sometimes work, or even if it could potentially works,1
Being gay isn't harmful.Additionally, it's worth noting that gay conversion therapy presumably -- hopefully -- doesn't operate via sexual abuse,1
Nor should it,1
So even if sexual abuse were found to "change" someone's sexual orientation, that doesn't mean that the current gay conversation therapy would work.Correlation doesn't imply causation.Let's suppose that there's a correlation between being sexually abused and being gay,1
Does this indicate anything about sexual orientation being changeable? No.Boys and girls realize they're gay at different times in life,1
Many report always knowing that they're "different", and some report knowing that they're gay from a young age (7ish in some cases),1
Being different makes kids feel vulnerable,1
Not just feel vulnerable, but be vulnerable,1
They're often isolated from their peers and scared of their friends and family finding out their secret,1
Child abusers are sickly drawn to this sort of vulnerability,1
If gay people are more likely to have been abused at a younger age, the causal direction is very likely the other way around.,1
 The way that Amazon works is that anyone can sell an item on there (not just the maker of the item),1
And, if it's your item that you physically own (or claim to own), then you can set whatever price you want.It's possible that someone owns a copy of the book and has decided to charge this amount for it,1
It is ludicrous? Of course,1
But that's their choice.More likely though, some computer algorithm has said, "Hey, this book is popular and hard to find -- I'll go charge X amount for it." The issue with computer algorithms is that the lack common sense,1
If you haven't specifically told them to account for some piece of information, then it won't just magically know to do it.In this case, what's happening is that the version of that book (the 4th edition) is no longer on sale, and it hasn't been on sale for nearly four years,1
The algorithm doesn't realize that it's not on sale because a newer, better version is,1
It doesn't realize that it should compare the price to that item and, if anything, be lower.The 5th edition is the latest edition and is a reasonable 530 rupees,1

 He should regret it,1
He should not have rescinded the offer publicly,1
In fact, nearly every part of this was wrong: objecting so strongly to the candidate's actions, actually rescinding the offer, and doing so publicly.1,1
He should not have rescinded the offer publicly.This is a private matter between the company and the candidate,1
It's not okay to disclose this publicly.2,1
He should not have actually rescinded the offer, when he could have just politely discouraged the candidate from joining.Instead of actually rescinding the offer, he could have gotten on the phone with the candidate and said something like this:I saw your post and you're still welcome here,1
However, I think you should join Uber instead,1
You want name brand, and they have that more so than us,1
The money differences are irrelevant in the long run,1
Don't make the decision based on that,1
It's so much more important to go somewhere you are excited to be,1
And if that's Uber, go for it,1
You can't go wrong.And so on.It probably would have worked,1
The candidate probably would have taken the Uber job,1
The CEO accomplishes the same thing, but now looks super mature, professional, and empathic,1
Right now, he basically looks like the opposite.If I'm wrong and the candidate joined Zenefits anyway, then isn't that what he wants?3,1
He should not have been so offended by the candidate's actions.So the candidate sees name brand as a "plus." Um, so? Who doesn't see that as a plus?If he thinks that most other candidates don't want the same thing, he's incredibly naive,1
This is especially true when hiring out of college,1
Of course they're going to think about long-term career options.I really don't see what's so offensive in this candidate's actions,1
He posted an anonymous question looking for career advice,1
Who cares? Nothing he said was even particularly negative about Zenefits.The Zenefits CEO made himself look like a jerk,1
I knew nothing about the Zenefits CEO prior to this, and I really don't think it's fair to generalize from a single action,1
But other people will,1
He looks naive: he's unaware that name brand is a factor in most people's decisions,1
There was nothing unique in this candidate's thought process.He looks immature and arrogant: he buys wholeheartedly into his mission, so he expects everyone else to -- even people who haven't joined.He looks like he's dodging responsibility: rather than accepting that he/his company might not have adequately sold the vision, he blames the candidate for not buying in sufficiently.He looks unempathetic: he's unable to look at it from the candidate's perspective and see that the candidate is being reasonable.He looks callous: revoking the offer, and doing so publicly, was mean.He looks unprofessional: there were much better ways of handling this situation, as I've explained here,1
Now, I'm not saying he is these things,1
I don't know much about him and I'm not going to generalize off of one incident,1
Maybe this is a weak point for him, or maybe this just caught him on a bad day,1
He's human too, and even CEOs of A-list startups make mistakes.But to people quicker to judge, he looks like all of these things,1
That's why this was such a stupid move.Also, can I just say..,1
when it's you vs the Uber CEO, and you are the one looking like a jerk, you know you screwed up.,1
 The question asks "Why are people showing support or sympathy for Salman Khan?", but most answers here instead seem to be giving reasons for not sympathizing with Salman, and not addressing why there is such a huge outpouring of sympathy for him,2
Inasmuch that he did something irresponsible that directly led to the death of a person and crippling of others, the court has found him guilty.However, sympathy isn't always rationally calculated after weighing all pros and cons and their expected utilities,2
It's typically a much more visceral reaction,2
Likewise, hatred or lack of sympathy is often almost equally visceral, and can be vicious and unreasoned,2
There are a lot of loosely independent sources which can give rise to sympathy or support for Salman Khan,2
Needless to say, this is said not in his defense, but is intended to be an attempt at analyzing why people behave the way they do.Let's look at some of them,2
Fan base: His fan base loves him, and like a lot of loyal fans, is sticking with him in times of distress,2
Its important to highlight here that Salman Khan has an exceptional fan following who fondly call him "bhai", the ultimate big brother; even the fandom SRK enjoys abroad pales in comparison,2
Thats the closest Bollywood gets to a Rajnikanth,2
His hard core fans are his extended family and so their sympathy is largely based on emotion and sentiment: the kind you would expect from your close friends and family (See Point 3).The nature of the crime: Many people (especially among those who are likely to read this answer) may find it easier to empathize and associate with Salman since, in the US v/s THEM dichotomy of lawful citizens and criminals, they would find it more natural to place Salman in the US group.In other words, while they will never imagine themselves in a situation where they would be in a place or time like a lower income group laborer who molests a girl, it is not difficult for them to imagine themselves in a situation like Salman's,2
People drink, and they often do utterly foolish and irresponsible things such as driving while drunk,2
After that, it's only a matter of a loose hand on the steering and a lot of bad luck, and you cause someone's death.Bollywood: The sympathy from Bollywood is largely expected,2
Some extremely tone-deaf and immature remarks from some Bollywood folks were indeed unexpected (you know which ones I am talking about), but barring those, the general sentiment is hardly surprising,2
He also appears to be generally large-hearted: tonnes of people have tweeted how he helped them out in times of need,2
You expect family members to support each other, so this reaction from Bollywood, which typically always sticks together as a fraternity, was not unexpected, especially in light of the other points which further help people rationalize the crime.Celebrityhood: Being a celebrity is a double-edged sword,2
At one end, the police officers and other people involved in this case have been living in hell because of pressure from all quarters,2
The story of the prime witness (who is now no more) is heart-rending to the say the least,2
On the other hand, a lot of people know, deep down, that if this were not a high profile case, it would probably never have gone even this far, was very likely to have been settled out of court, with the settled out of court part most likely being a euphemism.Like I mentioned above, sympathy is only loosely connected to lawfulness,2
A person who uses a legal loophole to rob an old widow of all her money and belongings and bring her to the streets may have 'technically' done nothing wrong, but is likely to get a lot of public hate,2
Likewise, being wrong does not preclude someone from getting sympathy.Prison sentences have to end up serving the dual role of keeping dangerous elements away from the society, and providing a disincentive for people by punishing them for breaking the law,2
Typically, these two often get treated differently by people,2
For instance, everyone seemed to sympathize with Ravindra Patil (the prime witness) when he said that he was put in prison with hard-core criminals for repeatedly failing to appear in court,2
All in all, the outpouring of support for Salman is not entirely unexpected,2
Whether it is unreasonable or not is a call I would leave for the reader to make,2
This answer is likely to be misconstrued and misinterpreted, so it bears repeating: it is intended not as a defense, but rather as an attempt at analyzing why people (have) behave(d) the way they do (did).(Thanks to Alankar for help with parts of the answer),2
 As a student, you would probably want to intern with multiple companies to get a wider range of experience and exposure,2
This might be helpful in making career choices later on, and at the very least would also broaden your network.Of course, this might change a bit based on other variables,2
At big companies like Google, one internship might be very different from another based on what teams you are on,2
Another potential scenario I can think of is if you are in a research internship and have developed a good relationship with your adviser,2
In this case, if returning helps you go deeper into the field and get good quality publications etc., you might want to return there especially if you are planning to apply to grad school.,2
 As others have written, while the term cottage cheese is commonly used to denote Paneer, there are slight differences in the way the two are made, and the ultimate difference from an end-product point of view is that paneer is pressed and comes out as a solid that can then be cut, while cottage cheese is wet and has loose curds which cannot be used the way paneer is used in Indian dishes,2
I've tried making palak paneer (paneer in a spinach gravy) using cottage cheese, and though I tried to strain the cheese, I still ended up with the cheese splitting and breaking down into tiny chunks and spreading all over the gravy.So what is the solution? Simple,2
Use the term Paneer and give people one of the following options: Tell them to buy paneer from an Indian storeIf an Indian store is not accessible, tell them how they can make a close approximation of paneer from cottage cheese, because if they use cottage cheese off the shelf in Indian paneer recipes, they will not get what they are aiming for.If they are particularly enthusiastic about it, tell them how to make paneer from scratch,2
It's not very tough, actually, and Youtube has tonnes of videos,2
Here's one by my favorite Youtube chef.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...English is a wonderful language that does not shy in absorbing foreign vocabulary,2
Let's add to the lexicon,2
:),2
 The short answer is that they do not,2
In specific, you should not think of the GRE as the JEE (or GATE) of the United States,2
Your JEE score is the sole decider of whether or not you get into IIT,2
On the other hand, the GRE is one of the many variables that are in consideration when deciding the fate of an application,2
The General GRE is also subject agnostic,2
It is NOT designed or intended to judge your competence in your major (there are Subject GREs for major-specific testing which are fairly technical and directly relevant),2
At its more general level, the GRE is for checking your general aptitude for graduate studies.For instance, while many people whine about the Analytical Ability (Verbal) section of the GRE, I think it is actually pretty useful,2
The expectation is that a person with Graduate level education (no matter what the field) has a fairly high amount of analytical and reasoning skills, along with the ability to correctly analyze texts, draw logical inferences, and express their thoughts in a cogent and cohesive manner,2
While it is true that this test hinges on one's English vocabulary, the vocabulary level of the GRE is actually pretty reasonable,2
Likewise, the Quantitative Aptitude section is a general gatekeeper section to ensure that everyone, even those from non-engineering, non-math backgrounds, have a basic level of quantitative ability.We can debate about whether or not the ETS is a giant scam, and whether or not the GRE should be required at all, of course, but don't assume that the GRE is the only thing that decides whether or not you get in.,2
 Most social niceties are a 'waste of time',2
But we extend them out of basic courtesy,2
The question then isn't about whether it is a waste of time, but whether the context needs you to ask that question.It is always about context,2
If you are in an office in America, and your colleague is German, you don't need to ask them if they know English,2
If you have been invited for dinner to a German family with whom you have not previously interacted, it might be nice to confirm that they are comfortable talking in English,2
If you are in Germany and are shopping in the market, you should probably not only definitely ask, but also ensure that you do it in an apologetic rather than demanding tone.,2
 So far, it looks unlikely that any language will replace English as the lingua franca in the foreseeable future,2
Imperialism is largely a thing of the past and we don't have large-scale wars anymore, and nothing is actively stemming the growth of English, and, in general, I don't see how any other language will rise to that position given the inertia that English has.English became dominant at a crucial time: the spread of globalism and the rise of digital technology and internet have more or less cemented this dominance,2
Many languages would have been considered to be so-called world languages at various points of time in history, but the first truly global language was and is English,2
I mean, no language even comes close,2
The only potential language that people keep touting is Mandarin, but I don't think it stands a chance either,2
Even if you were to discount for the extreme tall barrier that their writing system is, the fact is that none of the candidate languages have the kind of global traction that is needed for a language to become the lingua franca.,2
 When it comes to learning any language, there is nothing special about English,2
It needs the same kind of effort as learning other languages,2
The formula is usually straightforward: immersion and performance.Immersion: This is about how much exposure to that language the learner gets,2
In case of English, this is delightfully easy,2
We are surrounded by English content,2
Movies, radio, TV shows, songs, books, magazines, what not,2
No matter what your interest, you are sure to find English content in it,2
Encourage her to listen to and read English even if she doesn't understand all of it.Performance: Stimulus is one thing, but the next important thing is to actually use the language,2
All the time,2
Without worrying about being wrong,2
Encourage her to be adventurous and keep trying out new expressions,2
This is tougher for English because a lot of people already know it well and so there is this default expectation of competence, so she can begin with speaking English to a close group of people who can be expected to be supportive,2
One of your biggest enemies, if you are learning a language, is the existence of a viable alternative for communication,2
Even if you can talk to her in Hindi or Tamil, try to speak to her in English,2
You can speak a bit slowly if required, or explain stuff using different words,2
Encourage her, but also correct her as needed,2
Best of luck!,2
 My experience has largely been with scholarship/fellowship interviews, consulting interviews and CS coding interviews,2
At least in an interview setting, the tell me about yourself question is a pretty useful conversational starter and is often used by people to break the ice and make the interviewee comfortable,2
It is important that you dont get tensed up; instead, use this question to ramp up the interview,2
Jaime has talked about the kind of content you should have in your 'About Me',2
A few more pointers:Avoid rambling: Sometimes, when people haven't thought of what they want to say, they end up talking incoherently for a long time,2
You will bore the interviewer and likely make them disinterested,2
Do some homework on the kind of values the company has,2
It might be good to show them in your work to improve your cultural fit within the company,2
For scholarship interviews, it is useful if you can link stuff in your background with the values of the funding organization.If it is a general scholarship kind of interview where they are judging my overall profile, I like to end with my hobbies / other interests or whatever I like to do for fun,2
This helps me in two ways: It helps me end my monologue on a confident note, and it gives an easy anchor point that the interviewer can use to steer further discussionI think the ideal sweet spot is when your answer shows preparation (that you have thought about what you want to say), but doesn't look entirely rehearsed,2
In short, prepare a list of things you want to talk about, but dont memorize the answer word by word,2
Answers that sound rehearsed are a turn off, especially if you are applying for a job that relies on communication.,2
 I understand it would hurt to feel so disconnected with your son,2
While I cannot fix this directly, I'd try and help you with potential reasons why this might be so, and you could introspect a bit about whether they apply to you,2
Now, just to clarify, although I'd appear to be blindly favoring your college-going son, I am no apologist for our generation,2
I don't think we are blessed with exceptional intelligence or insightfar from that, we are winging it, like everyone else.I am going to talk about three things: Conflict, Autonomy and EscalationConflictMost people take the path of least resistance; they will tell you whatever lies you need to hear in order to minimize the conflict in everyone's life,2
What lies you get depends on what conflicts you mutually create,2
Sample this:Instance 1: (Son is out having dinner with his friends,2
His dad calls him)Dad: Kya kar raha hai? (What are you doing?)Son: Dinner karne aaya hoon baahar,2
(Ive stepped out for dinner)Dad: Jab dekho baahar ghoomta aur khata rahta hai,2
Mess hai na tere yahaan? (I see you going out all the time,2
You have messing facilities in the hostel, right?)Instance 2: (Son is out having dinner with his friends,2
His dad calls him)Parent: Kya kar raha hai? (What are you doing?)Son: Kuchh nahin, mess mein dinner kar raha hoon (Im having dinner in the mess)Parent: Yeh gaane ki aawaaz kahaan se aa rahi hai peechhe se (Why do I hear music in the background?)Son: Wo side mein lounge mein dance practice chal rahi hai..,2
(Erm, they have a dance practice session in the lounge)The truth is that you cannot realistically control every single living moment of your children's lives, especially not when they become adults themselves,2
So you have to resign yourself to the fact that they are going to do what they want to anyway,2
If you frequently express disapproval of their activities (in some cases, your disapproval may be justified, but that doesn't matter), they will probably just stop telling you about what they do,2
If it creates conflict or unnecessary headache or drama, it will be avoided,2
For instance, if your first reaction on hearing that your son has a girlfriend is one of anger (or worse: OMG! You have a girlfriend? No kissing! Get married soon!), you are pretty much guaranteeing that your son will never talk to you about his love life,2
Ultimately, unreasonable or excessive expectations are not going to be met with compliance,2
They are going to be met with defiance and deception,2
The question is, do you want them to live lives so secret that you don't even know them as persons any more, or do you want to actually be connected with who they really are? If you want to be a part of their lives, you'd have to relax a bit on trying to judge and control them.Note that this does not even need to be directed to your kid,2
If you make disapproving remarks about your neighbor's son getting a girlfriend, be assured your son is going to hide his from you,2
If, for instance, you made homophobic remarks while watching a movie or flipping through news channels reporting about 377, you can bask in the assurance that your gay son will never come out to you,2
Now, this is obviously not easy,2
After all, your values are not merely a fashion statement,2
You hold them because you, to a large extent, sincerely believe in them and subscribe to them,2
But every generation rebels,2
30 years ago, people might have prided themselves for having a 'love marriage',2
Many youngsters today take that to be the bare minimum.These differing versions of morality across,2
 generations aren't new, but it is possible that the chasm has widened due to the much more increased exposure that our generation gets,2
You will have to resign yourself to the fact that your kid may live a life vastly different from yours.AutonomyIf you made your child grow up with a lot of rules and restrictions, subjecting their lives to unnecessary or excessive scrutiny, there is a good chance that they will want to break free of it all at the first available opportunity,2
This is also why being overly protective is problematicyou are only creating a recipe for rash and irresponsible decision-making later, making them rush to make use of whatever autonomy they get, because they have been bottling up their frustration for so long,2
If you try to be too nosy or try to micro-manage their lives, they will initiate micro-rebellions,2
For instance, although they could tell you that they are going to Marine Drive with their friends, they'd choose NOT to, because that gives them a sense of self-control, of autonomy, and of not being constantly monitored or policed.Ironically, the more you try to be a helicopter parent of someone who is essentially an adult, the more likely you are to become distant from them,2
Someone I know had such helicopter parents,2
She worked in a different city, but they'd try to remote control everything she did, everywhere she went, and so on,2
Did it stop her from doing what she wanted? Obviously not, but it did encourage her to create an elaborate web of lies about her actions and movement,2
Whose gain was it? EscalationHow do you behave when your son does share something unpleasant with you? Do you go paranoid, or enter panic mode, or go just plain ballistic? If so, you are strongly disincentivizing him from sharing anything with you,2
There's a reason friends are often perfect for sharing your fears or worries or insecuritiesthey are sufficiently close to you without being so close as to take everything extremely personally,2
People share stuff for different reasons,2
Some just want someone to confide in who can process the information relatively calmly, not necessarily a problem solver,2
If you get emotional or teary eyed or livid at the shortest provocation, your kid will avoid telling you unpleasant stuff, as telling it increases the problems in his life rather than easing them.The 20s are a difficult time for all of this,2
People have to make the mental transition from needing their parents to potentially being needed by them,2
While school-going kids are taught to see parents as infallible authority figures, as captors who need to be defied, young adults have to slowly learn to see parents as more human, with their own hopes and aspirations, fears and insecurities,2
Between these two extremes is the territory most late teens and early 20s find themselves in, wherein they feel the need to assert their independence and gain footing in the world without being tethered to their parents.I don't intend to tell you that your kid is perfectly capable of taking all life decisions wisely,2
It is likely that he makes several bad decisions,2
But irrespective of whether he is or not, he is past the age where you can micro-manage his life,2
Just like the younger generation, you should also try and choose your battles, intervening only for stuff that merits intervention,2
(Hint: Haircut doesn't qualify)Needless to say, none of this is easy, and I'm obviously no expert, but I hope I did manage to shed some light on what you could potentially do to make it slightly less difficult.,2
 I mean, I can understand if we want more people to know about Sanskrit, but I don't get the obsession with wanting to revive it, or trying to shove it down people's throats,2
The sad part is that when it comes to nationalistic sentiments, we are faced with a perilous dichotomy:At one end, we have a breed of Indians who feel ashamed of showing any association with their cultural background,2
These are the kind for whom Yoga was uncool until the west appropriated it and made it fashionable,2
On the other end, you have those who credit everything from Cold Fusion to In-Vitro Fertilization to ancient Indian culture and spread half-truths and outright lies,2
And don't even get me started on the absolute nonsense that is generally spewed about Sanskrit, a language that deserves so much better.Both these extremes are ridiculous and untenable, and yet, these are the ones we keep encountering most often.Other answers have talked about making people feel proud of the past,2
Apparently Sanskrit is now charged with the gargantuan task of providing a nation of a motley group of 1 billion people a sense of common identity,2
Keeping aside the futility of the project, I'm pretty supportive of showcasing the laurels from our history, but with two giant caveats: correct messaging and intellectual accuracy and honesty.Correct messagingWhat is the undertone of the exposition? Usually I see outright racism or pointless chest-thumping,2
It is one thing to say, "Hey look at the cool stuff our ancestors did",2
It is another to say "My Daddy strongest! We were awesome, then foreigners came and now we are useless" or "North Korea, best Korea!"Accuracy and honestyFor every explanation of how the quadratic formula was derived by Indian mathematicians, we get 10 versions of how the Hanuman Chalisa proves that Hanuman jumped to the Sun because somehow distance * time = distance (I won't give links,2
If interested, feel free to Google "Hanuman Chalisa Yojan Proof" and you will get countless websites regurgitating this),2
For every explanation of how the Astadhyaayi cleverly encodes grammatical rules, we get 10 instances of "Sanskrit is the most beautiful, most unambiguous language in the world, Sanskrit sounds are a linear combination of all the sounds of the world".Until we fix these two, I don't want kids to be fed random trivia interspersed with lies and propaganda delivered with inimical messaging,2
[1] I am not using that term lightly,2
A lot of what is claimed about Sanskrit is nonsensical and cannot even be assigned a truth value.,2
 Beef is relatively uncommon at food places in India (restaurants, fast food joints etc),2
Popular joints such as McDonalds avoid controversy and maximize clientele by eschewing both beef and pork,2
However, you can find beef either at more upscale restaurants in cities like Mumbai or in hole-in-the-wall places in specific areas, such as in localities with a high concentration of Muslims (eg,2
Kurla),2
I imagine you could also find beef at touristy places with a generally high availability of Non-Vegetarian food (so Goa works, but Rajasthan won't).,2
 I thought about this myself when I first read Marina Keegan's thought-provoking article Even artichokes have doubts, but didn't find anything specific,2
Yesterday, I did a bit of searching again, and I think I have found the original source of the title, or rather, the source that the title seems to be alluding to,2
I think the title is a reference to a quote from the movie Amlie (Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amlie Poulain),2
The quote goes (Source: Amlie - Wikiquote):Vous au moins, vous ne risquez pas d'tre un lgume, puisque mme un artichaut a du cur.You couldn't even be a vegetable  even artichokes have a heart.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...,2
 Many factors make some languages more desirable to be learnt by people,2
On the global stage, English has emerged as the de-facto language that would make you most likely to be understood around the world,2
Some of the factors that contribute to this are:English is spoken in several countries around the world, so even passing competence in English is more likely to help you be understood around the world, whereas even expertise in Turkish is largely useless outside of Turkey,2
For a lot of people, the pragmatics of being able to communicate to a larger group of people far outweigh whatever motivations they may have for learning niche languages.English is massively culturally exported,2
Hollywood in particular and the American entertainment industry in general have given the world countless movies, TV programming, songs and the like that play over the radio or can be seen on TV no matter what country you are in,2
On the other hand, while some people might like Turkish music and watch Turkish movies outside of Turkey, Turkish culture has a significantly smaller active impact on the world.Because of the above factors, the knowledge of English often increases people's mobility, employability (and often, provides access to a much greater pool of information, or resources), much more compared to knowledge of relatively niche languages,2
If you look at the above points, you'd notice that they are largely interconnected,2
Each strengthens the other and it's the synergy across them all that makes English such a no-brainer of a choice around the world when it comes to choosing a language to learn,2
The following factors have little to no influence on most people's decision to learn a language: How old / culturally rich the language is: while this is of ample academic interest and would also interest literature / history enthusiasts, the fact that English is at least 600-700 years old has little to do with people learning it.How many people (pure numbers) speak the language: The spread of a language is much more important,2
A third of the world speaks Mandarin (or a close variant),2
Who cares? They are all largely concentrated in one part of the world,2
The Chinese stand to gain much more by learning English than the other way round,2
Likewise for Bengali,2
It's spoken by 210 million people,2
A very impressive figure, until you realize that most of them are in a very small part of the world (West Bengal and Bangladesh).Now let's move to Indian languages,2
As a language spoken in several Indian states, and understood to some extent by most of North India, Hindi lends itself more naturally as a lingua franca even in places that don't have it as a native language,2
With larger movement of people across the country, especially to IT hubs such as Bangalore, Hyderabad, and to some extent Chennai, Hindi is now establishing itself as a fairly staple language of these parts too,2
Note that this does not mean that Hindi is the only language there or that people do not speak local languages or English: there are tonnes of people in South India who do not speak Hindi,2
But a (only) Hindi speaker will be better off on the streets of Bangalore than a (only) Malayalam speaker on the streets of Chandigarh,2
So, it's a simple question of pragmatics outweighing everything else,2
A lot of people are not specifically enthusiastic about going out of their way to learn a new language,2
I mean, they would probably try to learn basic vocabulary and some abuses (which everyone loves to pick up), but they will do only as much is necessary to get by,2
If they are naturally immersed in the language, they would largely pick it up organically anyway,2
So I don't think it's so much about hesitation as about not having to.,2
 I think the multilingual dubs of Let it Go are largely an internet phenomenon; and when it comes to the internet, there is very little to gain by creating content in Hindi, since most Indians who consume content on the internet are likely to know English, and many of them might not have Hindi as their first language anyway.Plus, as another person said, it was probably not worth the effort (and investment) for them because India wasn't a strong target market for them even for the movie, let alone for internet videos.This kinda feeds into the side-effects of the linguistic plurality of India and the dominance of English among the educated masses,2
You would see a general lack of quality and quantity when it comes to production and consumption of content in non-English languages by Indians,2
It is our own doing,2
How many of us English-knowing Hindi speakers consume (let alone create) Hindi content, in any form? Do we read blogs in Hindi? Do we tweet or put FB statuses in Hindi? When was the last time someone staying in a big city read a Hindi newspaper? We are the hip crowd who, every time the Hindi dub of an English movie is released, can't go beyond the "omg what a ridiculous translation of the movie title,2
wtf is naagshakti why can't they just say Slytherin",2
This is a chicken and egg problem,2
There aren't too many good Hindi fonts, nor is there quality content in Hindi (whether in the terms of blogs or news websites or whatever) proportional to the number of people who speak it.Disney movies and shows usually do get dubbed into Hindi (and even Tamil, Telugu etc.) for Indian Television, so I guess they do bother to put in the effort when they think it'll be worth it.,2
 When people write their SOP (Statement of Purpose) while applying to graduate school or jobs, they write sentences like:"After completing my project in #FancyTopicName working with Prof,2
#BigShot, I decided to do an internship at #PrestigiousMNC so that I could apply my theoretical knowledge to real world problems and gain experience of the corporate environment"While writing SoPs, people talk as if their life path was perfectly charted out in advance, complete with Gantt Charts and Key Deliverables,2
You'd get the impression that everything they did was carefully choreographed and optimized for best performance,2
I am sure there exist a few such people who are blessed with both remarkable clarity and remarkable luck, but for most of us, this is usually not the case.People in college do usually have a (very) broad idea of what they like, and many have a general desire to do well and be successful, but most of them keep exploring, finding opportunities and making the most of the ones they get, and it is only in retrospect that the dots connect.You could consider doing the following to help your search:Don't be idle,2
Keep experimenting / enhancing yourself,2
If something interests you, try to focus on strengthening your profile in it,2
Do extra courses or try to work on a project with a professor, read up about it or talk to others who are pursuing it..,2
Nowadays it's fairly easy to pick up new talents or skills if you really want to.Maintain good academic standing,2
A lot of things that I mentioned in the first point would be easier to access if you maintain good academic standing,2
Especially in the beginning, when you don't have specific experience, you might get good opportunities purely based on your grades / CPI,2
These will then help you gain more experience,2
One leads on to another,2
Like it or not, for the most part, CPI is not an unreasonable metric to judge the ability to put in hard work and persevere.Look all around,2
At IITB, for instance, I've come across people doing all kinds of things, from the run-of-the-mill to the obscure, and often succeeding in it,2
Watching all these varied people engaged in a motley bunch of things is useful in two ways: It lets you know the kind of options you have, and it also shows you that those options are feasible,2
Use this to tell yourself that there's a lot you can do, but obviously do not limit yourself to what has already been done.The problem with people with stereo-typically 'good' profiles is that life often does not take their decisions for them through rejection,2
It's easy to decide when you have just 1-2 viable options; it's tougher when you have 10 of them,2
Try not to get overwhelmed by them, and instead try to derive a sense of security or comfort from them,2
As for absolute clarity about what you want to do, well..,2
that may never come,2
If it does for you, consider yourself very fortunate.,2
 A resume of some sort is usually always required when applying for any position (even those procured via personal contacts, which involve Dad calling his friend who works at a good company and requesting them to place you).You might not have a lot of stuff to write about in your second year resume, but that applies to most people who have just finished freshmen year,2
Don't worry about it,2
I just went through my freshie year resume for reference,2
Consider including the following stuff:Your rank in standardized exams: JEE, BITSAT etc,2
Olympiad performance (if applicable)Your Class X and XII Board percentageCourse project you did in first year, if applicableAny extra-curricular activities that you were part of in first yearAny other school level competitive exams that you might have participated in (NSO, NSTSE, NCO etc.)Any major activities or clubs that you were a part of in high school, or competitions you won, or positions you head, such as head boy / girl or House captainAny other awards or honors that you won in high school or first yearBest of luck!,2
 Today is 4th July, the American Independence Day,2
The American Declaration of Independence contains the lines:"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS."Extremely lofty ideals, undersigned by people who owned multiple slaves on their estates, while asserting and championing the cause of Equality.I imagine this question resonates with a lot of people who are probably reluctant to ask the same thing out aloud for fear of having some unpleasant label (sexist!, misogynist!, entitled male douchebag!, mail chauvinist pig) stuck onto them,2
The problem with replacing 'feminism' with 'equal gender rights' is that it, to a certain extent, trivializes or hides the fact that it is indeed women who've gotten the raw end of the deal across the years, and that actions specific to reversing this need to be taken to undo the mindsets of the people, and the consequence of the current eco-system,2
It is true that gender normativism, gender stereotypes, patriarchy and related factors hurt everyone,2
It hurts the woman whose gender becomes an automatic and unfair metric for judging her technical skills.It hurts the man who can't pursue fields that interest him and is forced to study 'engineering' because 'soft fields are for women' and because 'how will he run a family with his arts degree?'It hurts the couple who would probably be better off if the wife with better educational qualifications and experience worked and earned for the family and the husband with a knack for parenting stayed home and took care of the kids.It is also true that, as a corollary of the above, both genders also get superficial 'perks',2
Listing just a couple:Women receive perks from the medieval concept of 'chivalry': there is the expectation that men would pay for them on dates, offer them seats on the bus, brave the cold to keep them warm, get into fights to 'protect their honor' and what not.Deifying women and putting them on a pedestal: this is common in Indian culture, for example, with women being called 'Devis' (Goddesses),2
The flip side of this 'respect' is even less independence.The stuff written here is particularly dangerous, since it promotes an insidious culture that conveys the impression that there is a perfectly level playing field for men and women,2
In other words, it results in women winning minor so-called skirmishes (not having to pay for meals) while massively losing the actual battle (not having autonomy in general),2
It also leads to a certain feeling of entitlement on the part of men, who are raised to believe that they 'deserve' female companionship (or, sometimes, more bluntly, sex) because they 'did their part' (paid on dates, bought expensive gifts, went around shopping, and what not),2
This manifests itself in various forms, from the fashionable concept of the Friendzone, to more drastic consequences such as the Isla Vista killings.Finally, the root cause of injustices against both men and women is the patriarchal framework,2
For instance, men find it tougher to get custody because of the inherent assumption that women are better care givers, and what not,2
My problem with 'Equalism' is that it sets a target that most reasonable people cannot disagree with, without providing clarity about what exactly needs to be done, and masking out the fact that the playing field is tilted in one very-specific direction,2
As Eivind says in Eivind Kjrstad's answer to Is there a gender-neutral term for feminism?, the term would be fine "if the world we live in was roughly balanced between women and men", which it isn't.There is a FB group called "IITians against rape",2
It's a bunch of very well-meaning people, but I find the name rather hilarious,2
Being against rape is like the most trivial lower bound I expect IITians (or any decent human being) to pass; however, as I pointed out in Let's get rid of the misogyny, shall we?, well-meaning people who do not rape can still behave irresponsibly in other ways,2
"Humans for equalism" is then similar to saying "IITians against rape",2
It is not wrong, but, as long as there remain inequities, whitewashing them with neutral terms or trivial objectives isn't going to cut it.[1] I don't wish to convey that 'not having to pay for meals' is a female aspiration; all I am saying that, everything else being equal (which it isn't, but that's what people think), not having to part with money is better than having to part with money.,2
 The US gets a lot of flak for not using the metric system in everyday life,2
Why they don't change is easy to understand (it's a huge pain in the ass, with hardly any return),2
But it's not like the metric system is a perfect, universally applicable system.Powers of 10 are great for scientific calculations, but they are mostly terrible for visualization or approximation in everyday life,2
A centimeter is often too small and a meter often too big, and no one uses decimeter, so it doesn't matter that it exists,2
Because of the factor of 10, these units aren't conveniently divisible into thirds or fourths, which is again not conducive to everyday use,2
Think of recipes, for example,2
The cup, tea-spoon, table-spoon, fl,2
oz,2
system provides an easy, small-whole-number system for converting quantities,2
It is true that the non-standardization of what a cup or spoon is leads to inexactness, but in most cases, you can still scale recipes by using relative units,2
You ought to choose units based on what you are measuring,2
Height, for example is mostly measured in feet and inches even in India, and I find it more convenient than using the meters scale where most people would be between 1.5 and 2,2
Another example is temperature--the boiling point of water, no matter how important it is to Science, is of little consequence in every day life, especially since even temperatures lower than that are dangerous for humans,2
The freezing point calibration is more meaningful for people living in cold areas, but like another answer suggested, having a scale which uses the lowest and highest ambient temperatures you will experience as 0 and 100 anchors is pretty meaningful,2
So, there is nothing inherently 'practical' about the Celsius scale, and it could be argued that the Fahrenheit scale is more 'natural' for daily use.It is easy to visualize a quantity double or triple of a given amount; it's not easy to reliably visualize 10x of a quantity,2
For instance, you can see how big a centimeter is, but it doesn't instantly give you intuition for how big a meter would be,2
And visualizing 1000 such meters is again not trivial,2
So it's not like the 10x multiplier helps a lot in everyday life,2
If you are measuring driving distance, the fact that a centimeter is one ten-thousandth of a kilometer is largely useless,2
So a mile is equally well suited for expressing such distances, since both are arbitrary units anyway.The moral of the story is that while the merits of using metric units in scientific computation are plenty, they are not necessarily the most natural units to use for everyday life,2
Of course, it is possible to use them, like Europe does, but the best strategy of course is to use whatever tool you find convenient for your purpose.,2
 To better help you out, the mentorship team at IIT Bombay (known as the Institute Student Mentorship Program or ISMP) has come up with a compilation of relevant information for all the UG programs at IITB,2
This website has a lot of material, and the aim has been to provide students with detailed information about the curriculum and general job portfolios of every department,2
We try to keep it updated every year with the help of students and alumni,2
Hopefully, it will help you make a more informed choice,2
Visit: IIT Bombay Programmes.Apart from you branch, the bigger overall aspect that will affect your experience is of course your life on campus, and for everything about your next 4-5 years at IITB, from academics (or as we like to call itacads) to hostel life to Cultural (cult) and Technical (tech) activities..,2
To give you a better insight into how life@IITB will be and how you can prepare better for your hostel stay, we initiated a "Freshmen Forum" back in 2010, which we hope will be as useful to you as it has been to the previous 5 batches of IIT entrants.Around 70% of all new entrants register on this forum,2
It is maintained by institute mentors, and is the ideal platform for pre-freshmen (freshie-embryos?) to interact among themselves and with seniors,2
If you have apprehensions about ragging or want to know what to (not) get from home, you'll find answers to most questions there.Feel free to ask away @ Freshmen Forum 2014.Links:IIT Bombay Programmes Freshmen Forum 2014 - Index,2
 I have written about this in the About section of my blog Linguistrix, so will cross-post relevant stuff here,2
There's also a lot of relevant fodder from my SoPs :)For someone who's deeply into Languages and Linguistics, I started rather late,2
Although my first experience with Linguistics was in Class VIII, when my English teacher taught me how to write the phonetic transcription for English words.I got to know of phonetics, learnt how sounds are produced, how stresses and intonation work in languages, and how the phonemic inventories of the world's languages were so different yet analyzable using the same tools,2
But it wasn't until after I had taken JEE that I actually started exploring languages,2
Although linguistics itself isn't necessarily about learning languages, having some background in linguistics does make it easy to pick up new languages,2
In the largely creative atmosphere of IIT Bombay, I got the opportunity to pursue academic interests peripheral to my major,2
I studied French and earned the DELF B1 certification,2
I used audio courses to study elementary German, Arabic and Spanish,2
I enrolled in a Japanese course and passed the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) level N4, after which I promptly took up Mandarin, which I studied for a while,2
I became a regular reader of LanguageLog, the world's best blog on linguistics, and have learnt a lot from the posts there and gotten exposed to a wide range of linguistic issues,2
I also read books like 'The Language Instinct' and 'The Atoms of Language', which further piqued my curiosity.I also took an undergraduate course in linguistics, where I found myself in my element,2
Next, I took a course on Paninian Grammar, in which we studied the linguistic basis of ancient Sanskrit grammatical texts.I figured it'd be interesting to do something that combines my various interests, and Computational Linguistics seemed like a good option,2
So now here I am, finishing a Masters in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington, Seattle, and up for hire in the job market!,2
 I dislike most selfies, but not for deep psychological reasons,2
My reason is very personal and very, err, selfishMost selfies aren't good,2
By good, I mean, good-looking photographs that have value for people other than those photographed (or their very close friends),2
And because of social media, we have to end up seeing them anyway,2
However, that should of course not stop people from taking them,2
Which is why I speak just for myself.In the last few years, mobile cameras were getting better, so you came across plenty of decent pictures on your stream,2
At the same time, more and more people started owning DSLRs, or had friends with DSLRs, so you ended up seeing lots of good quality pictures on your feed,2
If pictures are aesthetically pleasing, they are fun to look at.Then came selfies, which took us back to the 2009 era in terms of overall photo quality,2
Portrait shots look best at higher focal lengths, and the effect of low focal lengths on selfie shots can best be seen below,2
Notice how the leftmost shot of the woman and the rightmost shot of the man are 'selfie-like', while the opposite end is the kind of shot you'd see in a magazine.(Couldn't find the original source for either image,2
Both have been uploaded several times on various websites).So now people choose to chronicle major events of their life (weddings, graduation etc.) with selfies,2
These were the kind of events for which I'd earlier see extremely high quality shots taken in good lighting conditions,2
Photographs that were a pleasure to look at even if you didn't directly care about the event,2
Now, we get grainy, close-range shots with 5-6 seemingly dismembered and 2-3 partially covered heads with everything looking out of proportion,2
Definitely not my favorite style for capturing special moments.All that being said, it's their choice to make, not mine to prescribe,2
Nonetheless, it is an interesting and curious social trend.,2
 I think the golden standard for pranks is that, at the end of it, the prankee enjoys it, or at least, can derive fun / humor out of it,2
This usually rules out most pranks that cause physical harm, or put the person in considerable danger,2
Dangling someone from their feet over a ledge would mostly count as bullying, not pranking, for example, even if you have no desire to drop them.Also, I hate 'Crying Wolf' style of pranks, where you give your well-wishers a false alarm for the sake of a prank,2
The most recent example I found is a commercial launched by Airtel (idea flicked from a similar Carlsberg commercial),2
The Airtel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...) one looks excessively fake and seems to have been terribly executed, but the idea remains the same"Call your friend late at night and tell them that your life is in danger, and that they need to come and save you." I find these to be in extremely bad taste, and just watching the video was so infuriating, that I am sure if any of my friends pulled such an asshole-y trick on me, it'd be the last time I ever had anything to do with them.Stuff that causes fairly short-lived confusion / fear but doesn't otherwise cause any harm is usually kosher,2
Switching shaving cream for toothpaste, although very flimsy, is kosher,2
Switching hot water for cold water, which then proceeds to scald the user, is not.Finally, a much milder variation of the 'crying wolf' prank, which I'd illustrate using a personal story.When I was a kid, our school once declared the next day as a holiday for some reason,2
It wasn't a regular scheduled holiday, so my parents were not aware of it,2
I went back home, secretly happy about getting a day off, and decided to make a prank out of it,2
I let my dad in on the prank, telling him about the holiday, but asking him not to tell my mom,2
I'm a bit hazy on the details but my 'plan' was that I'd wake up a bit late the next day, and delay everything so as to get late for the school bus,2
Then, when the whole household would freak out and my mom'd probably ask my Dad to drive me to the school, I'd shout Surprise! and reveal the truth,2
Everything happened as per the plan, except when I yelled surprise, my mom just said quietly"You could have pranked your Dad instead,2
He gets up late,2
At least I won't have had to wake up at 4:30 am to prepare your lunch,2
I could have gotten some extra sleep for a change." I had a chance to choose between a good prank and a bad prank, and I screwed it.,2
 In general, when people talk loudly to foreigners, they also tend to speak slightly slowly or tend to pronounce words more carefully and clearly,2
These things definitely make it easier to understand a foreign language, especially since a lot of phonetic reductions that are natural for a fluent speaker are very unintuitive to a person who has limited knowledge of the language.Be very careful with this though,2
Loud, slow, directed speech, especially if combined with gestures, can come off as extremely condescending and rude, and gives the impression that you think the listener is stupid.Since the line between accommodating and condescending is not too difficult to step on, err slightly on the side of caution,2
If you have more general command of the language (native / fluent speaker), you should ideally try to tune your speech to your listeners's language level,2
That is, try to speak almost naturally, see if the listener can cope up, and tone it down a bit as needed.,2
 The best thing is to check with the host so that you don't end up with 10 packets of Doritos or 5 bottles of ketchup, but if you are looking for ideas, there are loads of possibilities,2
All of the below can be picked up from a supermarket.Beverages: Soda, Iced-Tea, Iced-Coffee, Beer, Wine, Liquor, as depending on what kind of potluck it is,2
Cocktail mixes (such as a margarita mix) are also useful,2
Condiments / Dressings: Ketchup, Mustard, Salsa, Ranch, Peppers, Sauerkraut, Olives etc.Dessert: Cookies, Pies, Ice-cream, Cakes, Marshmallows etc.Miscellaneous: Chips / Tostitos, Cheese platter, Fresh fruits, Veggies, Salads etc.,2
 I can think of a lot of very useful things, and I won't possibly recall them all at the same time, so I will update this list as I do,2
I would also refrain from using superlatives such "My mom is the best mom in the world!"while they are cute and I can appreciate the sentiment behind them, they do not give a lot of useful information,2
Personal growthFilled the house with books and cultivated in me a love for reading, which I share with my mother,2
I was reading books in English, Hindi and Marathi as long as back as I can remember.Tried to give me access to stuff,2
I grew up very technology literateused computers since I was 7 (this was in the 90s mind you; now kids are anyway born into computers; I am waiting for the first foetal selfie), started learning programming at the age of 9, and in general, spent a lot of time tinkering with stuff.Since both my parents work, I've spent large amounts of time alone at home,2
To a large extent, they didn't police me around excessively and put unnecessary restrictions,2
To give you a very 90s example, we almost always had Cable TV at home while many other kids had it only during vacations,2
To my credit, I was never much of a TV-watcher anyway.Financial MattersWe were comfortable but we were not filthy rich, so they shielded me from any day to day financial woes if any, but made sure I still had the 'global picture',2
I think that being subjected on a daily basis to the family's financial issues is pointlessly stressful for kids (who can't do anything to solve them anyway), while completely shielding them from these matters makes them extremely sheltered and they end up with no perspective of where the family stands.By example more than instruction, taught me responsible financial decision making,2
Before any big purchase, we always spent time researching our options and trying to ensure we were making a reasonable choice,2
The result is that I rarely make impulse purchasesthere's always a bit of 'due diligence', so to speak.In the same vein, taught me financial triage by example,2
They didn't mind spending, but they tried to spend it on the right things,2
They spent on fairly expensive books (which, in today's money, might have costed, say, INR 3000-4000), but would have probably cringed at spending the same money on a single night, eating out.MiscellaneousMaintained a largely peaceful environment at home,2
I didn't grow up witnessing constant shouting matches,2
When I discuss this with people whose experience has been otherwise, they tell me that parental conflict was a big source of stress during their childhood,2
I particularly remember the most glowing example of this strategy,2
In the March-April period of my 12th grade, when all kids sit for various crucial and decisive competitive examinations, I remember that my mother had declared the house to be an absolutely zero-conflict zone, meaning that no one shouted, bickered or had unnecessary arguments in the house for those 4-5 weeks,2
Anticipated my growth needs and didn't hesitate in taking decisions towards it,2
My mom led the initiative to transfer me to a new school (further from home and more expensive) when she realized I wasn't getting enough exposure,2
My parents are very helpful and hospitable; it's a bit difficult to put into words but would be amply clear to someone who has been at the receiving end of their hospitality,2
I like to think that at least some of that has rubbed off into me too; I try my best to help people out.Many of the sentences here sound like lines out of a resume,2
If only the stuff you did as a parent could be written in resumes...P.S,2
I guess this is also a great time to wish my mom on Mother's Day and thank her for all of the above and for all the rest that I can't even begin to put into words.,2
 I hope that, by graduate studies, you mean something akin to an MS and not a PhD,2
You shouldn't join a PhD program abroad if it is not paying you any salary at all and requires you to take loans.While it's not possible to suggest what you should do without a more detailed understanding of your family's financial situation, as a general rule, I won't particularly recommend selling off family assets if you can avoid it.INR 30 Lakh is not an insanely large loan amount if you are going to enter an industry that is well-paying (which seems to be the case),2
For instance, if this were a CS degree, and you were going to get into Software Development jobs, you are all but assured an annual income of (at least) around USD 80 K.Job markets can be tough, though, and things can be trickier in Europe, so you should have a realistic assessment of all that,2
If your undergrad (and now grad) are from prestigious universities, that would certainly make things a bit easier.This also, of course, depends on where the asset is,2
If it is depreciating rapidly due to any reason, you might consider selling it,2
But most land assets in developing / upcoming cities in India usually appreciate more than your loan interest rate,2
Either way, this is something you should discuss with someone who has a better idea of the property market, and that is certainly not me.Finally, you should apply for scholarships in India that provide interest free loans,2
Some of them are: Narotam Sekhsaria Scholarship, K C Mahindra Fellowship, J N Tata Endowment Scholarship,2
Note that this year's cycle is largely over, so if you want one of those you might have to apply next year.(A2A),2
 A lot of people love traveling on freeways since it helps reduce travel time, lets you drive faster than you can in cities, and doesn't have a red light every couple of hundred feet,2
But how many people care about the US freeway system enough to memorize which freeway passes through which city (even in parts of the country they have never visited or care about) or to study the intricacies of freeway intersection design despite no other specific interest in Civil Engineering?(Source: Wikipedia)The first category of people I have described have largely a functional interest in those respective topics, such as liking cars because they help you move,2
The second category's chief motivation for their interest from an inherent enthusiasm or devotion for that subject matter which goes far beyond what the functional requirements it can (or needs to) serve, such as identifying a car from the skid-pattern its tires make, a skill that is of little use outside of forensics,2
I should point out here that not all such people manage to invest all the time that's needed to pursue this interest, but a lot of them do want to.The general term for such people is geeks,2
Geek is not a universal label,2
It usually goes with specific subject-matter, such as car-geek, or train-geek, or astronomy-geek (though it is true that without the specific label, a geek is usually assumed to be a tech-geek, but that's besides the point).People like to put themselves into such labeled groups because it is a means of self-identification, and also simultaneously a means of signaling to and finding others with similar interests,2
It can be intensely frustrating to have a hobby that you do not share with anyone around you,2
Worse, it's absolutely soul-crushing to be surrounded by people who not only don't share your hobby, but can't associate with that sort of crazed up geeky obsession with anything.And so if you are like a friend of mine, you'd join the Indian Railways Fan Club mailing list and would love to discuss this topic with others who can identify the make of a diesel engine by the sound of its horn.That brings us to food,2
Many people use the term foodies to refer to food geeks,2
I personally am not a fan of the word, largely because it sounds kinda childish, and, like most labels, it tends to be applied to anyone and everyone and sort of loses the point,2
But the ultimate arbiter of language is usage, so I am fine if someone wishes to describe themselves using it,2
Also, I am very skinny, and the first question people ask is "But if you love food how come you are so thin!?",2
Another is "But IITians to kuchh bhi khaa lete hain naa" [But IITians can anyway eat anything right],2
That gets tiring fast.You might be a food geek, if, as some others have suggested, you care about more than just the functional use of food,2
You care about knowing more about how it's made, possibly making it yourselves, about what goes into it and how the various ingredients contribute to the final taste, about possessing interesting tools, devices, utensils etc to help you in your cooking, and about the kinds of skills people who cook food professionally exhibit (I have spent way too much time staring at cooks deftly throwing dough into the air to roll it for Pizza bases or Rumali Roti, and at people chopping onions at blazing speed):https://youtu.be/0tpvNUH3KDI?t=5sSo, yes, there is more to being a food-geek than just wanting to eat food,2
And people who share that extra enthusiasm for food like to identify themselves and possibly others.,2
 Consultancy firms usually like to see excellence in whatever you want to do (usually called spikes in the resume, and I will use that term here without loss of generality) and in my experience with the IIT process, usually aren't too picky about any one kind of excellence,2
The ideal profile of course has more than one spike, but I have seen loads of people getting shortlisted for interviews with excellence in just 1 domain (or a bunch of very closely related domains),2
Some of the 'standard' examples (but by no means exhaustive) of strong profiles in particular domains are:AcademicTop of the class with a very good CPI (say DR 5 or better, and 9+),2
Research experience, especially at reputed institutions,2
If papers / patents, then even better,2
Other awards or achievements surrounding academics.Cultural / SportsDomination or significantly wide-spread participation, victory and involvement in a culture genre / sport, including wins at various level such as intra- and inter-college levels,2
Any other formal acknowledgment if possible.OrganizationalStrong leadership roles at hostel or institute level or those involving large projects or dealing with a lot of people,2
and so on..,2
In each of these, you'd notice that the usual expectation is that you do whatever you are doing really well,2
There do exist small differences in the preferences of the top 4-5 consulting firms,2
I have noticed, for example, that one of them has been focusing on very stereotypically academic profiles in the last 2-3 years, while another focuses rather strongly on people with organizational experience,2
A CPI of 8, however, while being good, probably isn't amazing enough to be a spike, but you should hope that your other academic achievements make up for it.From what you describe, I imagine that at least some consulting firms would find your profile interesting, though they might be a bit skeptical of whether you really want to be in consulting, given that your profile is particularly well suited for academia and research,2
This is something you have to first convince yourself of, and then the firms you apply to,2
Best of luck!,2
 One of the top answers on this page (by Robert Frost) suggests that "Be a man" means to evidence the aspirational characteristics of a grown man, such as strength, bravery and control.If words could mean whatever the heck we wanted them to while ignoring the ground reality of how they are used by society, then I could posit that calling a woman a 'bitch' actually compliments her reproductive ability by assigning her the characteristics of a female dog in heat,2
After all, that is what the literal meaning seems to be, and there is nothing wrong in being called a female dog anyway, right?Unfortunately, the meanings and implications of words, which they absorb based on the way they are used, cannot just be wished away, and even if the speaker who uses them is clean of intent, they can still have ill-effects."Be a Man" is the kind of exhortation that is almost exclusively directed at boys and men, and is usually in response to displays of emotion or sentiment or 'weaknesses' which are considered fine when done by women,2
Note that this is unfair to both men and women,2
I am sure corollaries of the same can be found in cultures around the world,2
Hindi popular culture has a line Mard ko dard nahin hotaa (A real man doesn't feel pain),2
This kind of messaging is fairly pervasive in society,2
For instance, guys who cry are usually asked not to cry like (little) girls,2
As a side note, I find the societal prejudice against crying rather laughable, since I find it to be of immense therapeutic value.Of course it is true that most people who ask others to 'man up' or to 'be a man' aren't necessarily misogynists themselves,2
But this name-calling achieves absolutely nothing anyway,2
You could pluck petals and count 'Misogynist! Not a misogynist!', if you want, and we would get no further as a society unless we figure out exactly why such statements are problematic and correct the problem.As Gayle has suggested in her answer, whether we like it or not, misogynist or not, well-intentioned or not, this phrase (and specifically, its common usage):perpetuates a lot of (hetero-normative) gender stereotypestakes some supposed ideals (such as excessive stoicism) and sets them up as specifically associated with menassociates the negative quality of the lack of said dubious ideals with the female genderA certain amount of stoicism in the face of adverse circumstances is a positive quality, but encouraging (or rather peer-pressuring / bullying) people to bottle their emotions up forever because displaying them is unmanly is hardly the ideal we want to set up as a society anyway, as Eivind has pointed out in a long comment debate below one of the answers.Moreover, I find this phrase pretty indefensible even if we were to ignore the 'display of emotion' aspect and focused entirely on stuff like bravery or altruism,2
As cliche as it sounds, kids should rather be getting the message that they ought to be brave because they are good human beings, and not just because they are boys / men who have to act as knights in shining armor for their fragile princesses.Back when I was in primary school, if any of the boys had very long hair, the biggest threat the teacher used to offer was that if the kid didn't get a haircut soon, they'd put a clip / band on his head,2
These are kids in single-digit ages, and they are already learning that society considers it embarrassing for guys to be like girls.I could go on and on and cite examples, but I hope I have made my point,2
This kind of harmful messaging is all-pervasive, and phrases like "Be a man" are instances of the same, no matter what their original, optimistic intention be,2
I should point out here that "Be a lady" is almost equally regressive,2
A phrase sometimes found in Hindi stories is   (literally: diffidence / shyness fit for a lady),2
We no more want to teach girls they should always be diffident and shy than we want to teach boys that they should suck it up and not cry.When people talk about empowering women and removing gender divides, they focus largely on reducing rape and increasing employment for women,2
Most of us never realize the inimical effect of all these tiny but constant and ubiquitous signals that we as a society send to ourselves.I know all this seems like petty nitpicking, but I hope that we all agree that, as a society, we should be moving away from such normativity and especially from deriving modern-day ideals from the middle-ages.We cannot stem all of it, but the least we can do is to not actively condone it.,2
 Here are some things that usually never get told, and I figure they are worth giving a thought to,2
I'll talk about three things:Eschew Department StereotypesLook for full disclosureHave Fun with AcadsEschew Department StereotypesEver since the day you came to know about your branch allocation, you must have been inundated by pointless, irrelevant and often wrong feedback about your department,2
It will worsen now that you are in IIT, with every other person commenting on your branch selection and passing along traditional wisdom,2
If youve taken a low-ranking branch despite getting a high rank, youd be called stupid,2
If youve opted for Dual Degree when your rank allowed you to choose BTech, youd be called stupid,2
If you let it be known that you intend to do research in Meta, youd be called stupid,2
You will soon realize that, as a freshie, its very easy to be called stupid..Its also equally devoid of content,2
By giving in to department stereotypes, you not only straitjacket yourself, you fall prey to years of prejudice,2
Choosing Meta is not stupidbut whiling the first two semesters away because you were told Meta is a lukkha branch is,2
Obviously, branch does matter,2
All men may be created equal, but all branches certainly are not, which makes it all the more important that you have a realistic idea about your branch, instead of swallowing recycled stereotypical trash hook, line, and sinker.Department stereotypes are self-fulfilling propheciespeople tell you there are no future prospects in X branch, and you spend your IIT life resigned to this fatality, while wiser people go ahead, pursue those prospects, and get them.Eschew Department Stereotypes.Look for full disclosureAs freshies, you would find yourself at the receiving end of advice, suggestions, opinions, recommendations and what not from a wide variety of people (including, rather ironically, from me, through this post),2
Develop the judgment to figure out whose opinion to take on a particular matter,2
It is very rare that youd encounter a person who could give you valuable advice across a large and diverse array of fields,2
The guy who gives you excellent dating advice wont necessarily give you great foreign-internship fundae,2
And the friend who you trust your deepest secrets with might give you lousy advice about which elective to take.Also, look for full disclosure,2
Often, a lot of what people would tell you would be tainted with whats good for them instead of whats good for you,2
Did the hostel sports secy just tell you its not necessary to study for next days Maths Quiz because he wanted you to go cheer for the Hostel Water Polo team? Did a CG/Manager just tell you CPI doesn't matter? Did your neighborhood 10 pointer just tell you extra-currics are useless? No one really wishes you bad, but that doesn't mean you take in everything they say without scrutinizing it and looking for full disclosure.I find it funny when the only credential juniors offer about a piece of info/opinion is "Kisi senior ne bola hai" [Some senior told this to me],2
Avoid having "One Stop Seniors",2
At IIT, you find yourself part of a diverse group of brilliant people,2
Everyones different, and unique,2
Theres a huge wealth of experience to tap into,2
Talk to everyone, but take a smart call about who you would trust best for what.Look for full disclosure.Have Fun with AcadsIIT(B) is not Three Idiots; it is not Rang De Basanti; it is not Main Hoon Na,2
In fact, it isn't anything like the stereotyped mush that Bollywood (and other mainstream media) feeds you under the all-inclusive heading college life.A common motif in most colleges, and IITB is no different, is a fashionably cavalier attitude towards academics,2
Its a screwed up system where not only is it OK to not study, its actually socially desirable,2
Instead of going into a hatred spiral where you teach yourself to not give a fuck about academics, try to look at courses and subjects as something potentially interesting,2
Obviously, neither all courses nor all professors will be fun, but youll be surprised at how much the quality of your experience would improve if you treat academics with slightly more openness.Ask questions,2
Interact,2
Maybe read up a bit,2
It wont need a change in your schedule,2
Just your attitude.Dont suck up to profs,2
But carry an ounce of empathy.Have Fun with Acads.This was originally written for my blog (To Freshies - Antariksh's Blog),2
Originally, this post was supposed to be a retrospective post about college,2
I took those elements and condensed them into a few things that Id want to say to the new batch at IIT,2
Theres nothing batch-specific about the post, though.,2
 I think it's great.And frankly, I don't quite get the negative hullabaloo around this at all,2
Most of the internet seems to have well-deserved appreciation for this move, but I've also read some nasty comments too, which I hope are not representative of the majority.Since the benefits of such a move by FB are self-evident to quite a few people, I'll rather answer key points of criticism that I found on the internet."This is the height of political correctness!"This has really nothing to do with political correctness,2
The fact is that not all people comfortably identify with the binary buckets that we like to put ourselves in for ease of classification,2
And I imagine it would be greatly relieving for such people if they are given greater freedom to choose.Plus, it causes no difference whatsoever to the lives of most of us who are lucky enough to have identities that more or less align with social norms,2
And it makes a positive difference to the lives of the relatively few who to whom it does matter,2
A friend of mine, for instance, changed their pronoun setting on FB to they from the original he,2
Did it make any difference to my life? No,2
Did it make some positive difference to my friend's life? Apparently it did.What exactly are we afraid of? That kids would now be exposed to these fancy-schmancy terms that 'weird people' use to describe each other? Well, perhaps this is an excellent time to have a discussion with kids about the fluidity of sex, sexuality, orientation, identity and about the difficulties involved in navigating a world that finds it too difficult to see any shades other than white and black,2
If it leads kids to have better understanding and sensitivity about any of these things, and it makes at least a few of them stop bullying that 'girly, sissy kid' in school, we would all be better as a society."We should strive to discourage gender stereotyping completely instead of giving people 50 buckets to stereotype others into"But this isn't about stereotyping either,2
It is true that there is diversity of form and expression in this domain,2
It is also true that this should not be grounds for discrimination,2
The two are rather independent,2
The solution to the problem of stereotyping isn't to declare that we stop acknowledging variation or diversity,2
The path to greater acceptance does not include brushing stuff under the carpet."This is just a move by FB to make more targeted advertising possible!"Well, that's certainly plausible,2
Or even highly probable,2
But let's look at the horrifying implications of that claima company that makes a very large percentage of its 7 billion dollar revenue out of advertising added a feature that helped increase its advertising revenue.So, yes, even if FB did it primarily to increase their ad-revenues, it still remains a fact that it lets people express themselves more freely,2
And that's a good thing.,2
 My roommates and I were discussing (in jest, in case that isn't clear) yesterday night that we should all root for Sundar Pichai for the MS CEO role, just so that we can maintain the IIT hegemony in the tech industry,2
Jokes apart, though, I think most people realize and acknowledge that hard work and stellar performance almost always trump academic pedigree,2
This is likely to be overwhelmingly true for the choice of a CEO, where you'd rather judge a person on the acumen they have shown and the results they have delivered for their company across the years, rather that what school they graduated from 25 years ago,2
If it is true that Sundar Pichai was a strong contender for the post, I am rather confident that at no point of the selection process did anyone say "But this one is from IIT and that one is not!", except perhaps as a joke.Academic pedigree does often help you (or make it easier to) get into desirable jobs in the beginning of your professional career,2
It also usually increases your chance of being at the right place at the right time, and of grabbing a good opportunity,2
It also makes it more likely to be part of a great peer group, and these things come with other synergistic effects,2
It is also likely to lead to a more enriching undergraduate / graduate experience,2
But it is neither necessary nor sufficient for being 'successful' in life, and this probably stands true for a widely diverse range of metrics of success.IITians would do well to realize (if there are those that already don't do so) that the IIT on their resume doesn't give them a trump card or an all-access pass, and those who could not get into IIT despite wanting to would be well-advised to not consider their academic background a major impediment.This is true for the IITs, just as it is true for top US schools, and I don't think Satya Nadella's appointment has changed that.[1] I am assuming here that many people consider an IIT degree to be academic pedigree.,2
 There are many ways in which running marathons seems to be well-placed as a fund-raising activity, and appeals to us more than many other fund-raising mechanisms.From the POV of the fund-raiserRunning is an activity that is accessible to almost all of us,2
Barring specific cases of handicap, everyone can run, no matter how old, young, thin, fat, tall, short, and no matter what their general athletic condition is,2
Everyone and their grandmother, almost quite literally, can run,2
There has also been research demonstrating that the human body is particularly well-suited for long distance running.In continuation of the above, running is largely money-agnostic,2
Casual runners do not need very specialized gear, and you don't need access to fancy courts or other infrastructure,2
Feel like running? You can start today,2
You are rich? Doesn't matter,2
You are still gonna have to run yourself,2
Can't delegate it,2
This is also a kind of fund-raising activity that is not dependent on entry into elite social circles,2
Unlike, say, high-profile charity events,2
[Edit: it is true, though, that some marathon events tend to be very elitist and expensive for runners]Running, and the lead up to it when people train for it, promotes a culture of physical fitness,2
It creates positive idols, so to speak, and is therefore well suited with the whole charity image,2
Unlike, say, just starvation.A marathon is short enough an event to impact public memory and to attract media attention,2
If you want to do a 10-day long drawn out thing for charity, people are likely to get bored.From the POV of the donorIt doesn't ask money for a product / service that can otherwise be obtained at a potentially lower price / better quality elsewhere, and thus doesn't give you the feeling of being forced to spend money on something you probably don't need or appreciate,2
Unlike, say, scout-cookies.Deep down, I imagine that most of us have (not sure whether innate or conditioned) appreciation for raw hard work,2
Often, hard work and perseverance are considered as the ultimate arbiters, and running is the kind of activity that demonstrates pure, raw, determination and hard-work, untampered by anything else that'd tilt the playing ground,2
Rather, in continuation of the previous point, it abstracts out any product / service and replaces it with just hard work and perseverance,2
I will end with a small quote from Three Men on a Bummel by Jerome K Jerome Folks with nothing else to do, nursemaids chiefly and errand boys,with now and then a perambulating costermonger added, would gatheron the common of a fine morning to watch them pass, and cheer themost deserving,2
It was not a showy spectacle,2
They did not runwell, they did not even run fast; but they were earnest, and theydid their best,2
The exhibition appealed less to one's sense of artthan to one's natural admiration for conscientious effort.I think it's this natural admiration for conscientious effort, unfettered by anything else, that appeals to us all the most about marathon events.,2
 As a general rule, if you are in a foreign country, it is usually never a problem if you try to speak the local language [and appear to be making a genuine attempt rather than trying to mock them],2
The response you get may vary slightly with where you try this, but it is in general positive,2
In countries where English is taught but not really spoken all that much, the service staff would mostly be more than glad to talk to you in t the local language, and even humor your potentially wrong attempts at it,2
Even in places like India, where most people in the service industry (such as in fast-food places and so on) speak in English, and where English is relatively more common in every day life, we love listening to foreigners speak Hindi (or whatever the relevant local language is), even if it is just a terribly mispronounced "NuhMUHsTay",2
In some cases, though, especially in countries whose local language is spoken no where else, and where English literacy levels are very high, people are sometimes reluctant to talk to outsiders in the local language,2
Whether this is out of courtesy for the listener or out of the annoyance of having to listen to your language being butchered by a non-native speaker, or a mix of both, I don't know,2
Personally, as a language learning enthusiast, I find it very very annoying if I make an attempt to speak in the local language and I get replied to in English, but I usually give people the benefit of doubt and assume that they either did it out of courtesy or just wanted to practise English.Finally, when you are in the queue at a fast-food place or even in a busy supermarket, people might just not have the time or patience to entertain your attempts at trying to communicate in the local language if you are not making a lot of sense,2
So it might be better, in such circumstances, to communicate efficiently in English, and delay language practice to a more suitable time.Most people appreciate it when someone tries to learn / speak their language, and tend to warm up considerably to foreigners who do so,2
Don't miss the chance!,2
 I dont think Mood Indigo or IIT Bombay are at fault just because Palash Sen said something during Mood Indigo,2
As a matter of fact, if anything should tarnish IIT Bombays reputation, it should be the fact that Palash Sen said nothing that is not already expressed overtly or covertly in the male-dominated culture of the institute [1],2
The fact that most of the crowd cheered him instead of booing him is more telling,2
However, these are useful lessons for the future for everyone involved.Is Palash Sen sexist at heart? Does he lack respect for women? I don't know nor do I care,2
So, articles trying to prove that he is not sexist because he treats his coworkers well or because he wrote a song about mothers are not really relevant to the issue,2
The world probably won't become a better place even if we somehow proved so, because the issue isnt about who he is, but what he did.Specifically over-targeting Palash Sen, baying for his blood, calling for blanket bans on Euphoria, trying to somehow establish that he is sexist and an evil man, and other hyperbolic actions like these serve only to derail the actual issue that the Mood Indigo debacle has highlighted,2
And it's not often that such issues come into limelight,2
So lets use this opportunity to step back a bit and take stock of the situation instead of fulminating all over the internet.(In this answer, I will not use words that tend to bucket individual into 'opinion / action groups', such as feminists, misogynists, and the like,2
Let's attempt to see the whole issue without labels.)The first step is to understand why a certain faction of the society is displeased with what took place at the Euphoria concert at Mood Indigo,2
Mind you, what Palash Sen said is neither new in content nor category,2
As far as content goes, I am sure you've all heard stuff like this countless times,2
As for category, it was very representative of the kind of speech that peddles reductionary class-based stereotypes,2
There are reasons why such comments are frowned upon, and they have nothing to do with Palash Sen, Mood Indigo, or Euphoria,2
First, lets talk about stereotypes:Stereotyping by itself isn't always necessarily harmful,2
The key here is to understand what kind of environment a particular stereotype creates or perpetuates [2],2
For instance, in India, you may stereotype Bengalis as fond of sweets, or Tamilians as fond of curd rice,2
In absence of any other relevant evidence, this is a fairly harmless stereotype,2
However, if Bengalis are being systematically and unfairly persecuted by other communities because of their fondness for sweets, or if someone who doesnt like curd rice is systematically denying Tamilians equal opportunities just because they are from the South, it is easy to see how invoking such stereotypes would be below the belt.The second thing of note is that merely the fact that a stereotype is statistically correct doesn't make it okay to peddle it,2
It doesn't take a genius to observe that there are fewer women than men in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, while the reverse may hold for, say, the liberal arts,2
However, using this as proof that 'men are for brains' while women are for beauty is not correct,2
Additionally, it is important to realize that a possible reason for not too many women being in STEM fields is the fact that their participation receives significantly more social resistance than that received by men (if any),2
They also receive a continuous stream of both subliminal and overt messaging that discourages them from pursuing these fields,2
And when some of them do get into institutes like the IITs, they enter a male dominated world where guys are taught that IITian girls are ugly and non-male and what not,2
As if that were not enough, entertainers come to their cultural festivals and peddle this very stereotype again,2
And again,2
And again,2
Do you see why this is a problem?Two negatives stereotypes don't cancel each other,2
Saying 'girls are for beauty' doesn't become alright just because you also say 'boys are for intelligence',2
A couple of answers here seem to suggest that it's okay for someone to peddle patriarchal stereotypes if everyone is equally insulted,2
Sorry, but it doesn't work that way,2
Saying that boys shouldn't / can't cook is as bad as saying that girls shouldn't / can't,,2
 say, drive,2
Both perpetuate hetero-normative gender stereotypes,2
Palash Sen's comments feed into the very same patriarchal stereotypes, and are hence being considered to be in bad taste,2
Not only is mindless stereotyping therefore problematic in itself, but in a lot of cases, this affront comes from a privileged group that was often primarily responsible for causing the marginalization of the group that they are now mocking,2
Imagine being excessively bullied in school, being made to resent your existence, and then being laughed at by those very bullies for being in the wretched state you are in,2
Now imagine this happening day in and day out,2
Whether it be men mocking women, or whites mocking blacks, or the straight community mocking the LGBTQ community, such behavior is not too different from bullying.Whatever be the issue, such cavalier commentary is often so commonplace that most dont even realize that it is potentially harmful, and most dont realize that those who raise voices against it arent necessarily doing it for publicity.The second step is to realize that, as members of a class that has historically been privileged, it is not always easy for people to see or notice this disparity or discrimination,2
How many of you who are right-handed have noticed that the desks in many classrooms are much more difficult to use if you are left-handed? If you hadnt noticed this so far, that does NOT mean that you hate left-handed people,2
It doesnt mean that you dont want to help them,2
It just means that you have hitherto been completely unexposed to the problems of being left-handed because you have been lucky enough to have the world designed for the default setting that you belonged to,2
And that is perfectly fine,2
But when someone does point out why this is problematic, I think they deserve to be heard instead of being typecast as pseudo-whatever,2
IIT Bombay has now officially banned Euphoria,2
This is a bit like suspending a police officer for taking a 200-rupee bribe, or failing a student for cheating when everyone knows that most others cheated too,2
Its technically correct, but it doesnt necessarily improve anything in itself unless the system is cleansed too, because the police officer is mostly just a symptom of the bigger problem,2
[Later edit: I completely agree that celebrities (or anyone with a larger reach) should hold themselves to higher standards than others,2
But, these standards will come into place only when people realize and accept that there IS indeed a problem if you say in front of 10000 people that women are for beauty and men for intelligence,2
What annoys me isn't that Palash Sen said those things, but the fact that he so steadfastly refuses to acknowledge that they could indeed be problematic,2
It is clear that it's not a 'communication gap', since his clarifications are as incriminating as the initial claims,2
We all do slip up at times, but given time to look back at our actions, we should realize and own up if they were problematic,2
Palash Sen has refused to do that, and instead chose to bully those who raised their voice.So, not only did Palash Sen not show basic empathy, he: A) Trivialized the protest and mocked the protesters by making the facetious remark that they perhaps wanted to call him sexy/sexiest and not sexist,2
B) Refused to accept that what he said was problematic in any way,2
C) Tried to absolve himself of basic responsible behavior by implying that he didn't need to be mindful of what he said because he isn't a social activist.These are not signs of a man who hates women,2
But these certainly are signs of a man who, though he might respect women, is simply oblivious to the kinds of issues that plague our society,2
I expect better from our celebrities and role models.]And so, if our educational institutes really care, there is significantly more to be done by way of educating the thousands that pass through them, so that the next time someone says something like this at MI, we dont see statuses on FB suggesting that girls just cant take a joke.P.S,2
There are some additional issues here, which deserve some discussion, but this answer has already gotten too long, so I will probably write about them on my blog instead.[1] Let's get rid of the misogyny, shall we? - Antariksh's Blog [2] Gender Identity: What is wrong with sex-typing?,2
 Kinda sorta maybe yes, but like with everything, it's more complicated than that,2
Of course, it'd be nice if the English spelling system weren't so opaque,2
It would certainly help if more people could spell English words correctly more easily and learners (both native and non-native speakers) didn't have to waste a lot of time wrapping their head around the idiosyncracies of the English spelling system,2
After all, most other languages that use the Roman alphabet have a spelling system that's significantly more systematic than that followed by English,2
However, if your ideal is 'pure phonetic orthography', by which I take to mean that you're referring to a system that accurately and predictably represents in their spelling the exact pronunciation of English words, then you are in for a lot of trouble,2
First, which pronunciation? Even for languages that are spoken in a small area, you tend to get pronunciation variations across dialects, and across speakers,2
And that's for languages with a few hundred thousand speakers,2
Think about English, spoken by hundreds of millions all over the world,2
First language for some, second language for some others, and a third (or nth) language for the rest,2
Even within what you consider native speakers, you can expect to get a tremendous amount of variation, and it is tough to identify one canonical form.So, whose English would you spell phonetically? Would you spell pin and pen identically in Southern United States since the two words are homophones in their dialect? Or would caught and cot be spelled differently in Britain but identically in, say, Western United States? If everyone's gonna spell English their way (and they should be allowed to, if the whole point was to spell it purely phonetically), is this less chaotic, or more chaotic, than the status quo?Check out the variation in the caught-cot merger in North America (Source: Wikipedia),2
Mind you, this is just one particular variation,2
Furthermore, even if you did choose a dialect, what kind of speech should you accurately represent? A word spoken carefully as an individual utterance can sound very different from the same word spoken in a sentence, and even that can change based on stress and other factors,2
And finally, as a few others pointed out, it's sometimes worthwhile to maintain 'deep orthography',2
Since the words writer and rider are homophones in many US dialects, would you necessarily gain more by expressing the action of writing as write but the person who performs the action as raiduhr (or whatever system is chosen)?These are only some of the issues,2
Like it or not, at some level, spelling representations serve as abstractions of the underlying phonetic forms,2
Moreover, they are usually not expected to convey information to a person not familiar with the language,2
Even in languages with fairly unambiguous spelling systems (Indian languages, I am looking at you), the written form is almost never 'purely phonetic',2
The English spelling system should have been more regular,2
But purely phonetic? Not really.,2
 One of the first things taught in an introductory linguistics course is that our knowledge of our native language is tacit knowledge,2
It is notoriously difficult to actually write down the patterns that you observe in a language,2
But ask any native speaker if a sentence is grammatical, and they would tell you their judgment instantly.When people formally study their native language, or see others studying it, they are often introduced to the correctness conditions [1] of their language, or to interesting phono-morpho-syntactic tid-bits,2
This can be very fascinating, and very revealing, since they had probably never looked at their native language in that light,2
For instance, Hindi speakers might tell you that the Hindi spelling system is very phonetic and exactly represents words as they are spoken, but probably never realized that they pronounce a word like  in     differently from that in     (the nasalization in the terminal vowel of the second word is irrelevant to the example).There's also another factor in play here,2
Some people might still associate 'complexity' with language superiority or with a language being more developed / advanced / evolved (or similar pseudo-scientific terminology) based on how complex it is,2
And so there is some pressure towards maintaining the status of your language by asserting that it's fairly complex,2
Note that this doesn't mean that languages absolutely don't differ in their degrees of learning difficulty,2
Different aspects of a language may be of varying levels of difficulty for a learner based on the languages they already speak,2
And it is possible that aspects of a language may take a child slightly longer to pick up,2
But, in general, it's not a good idea to trust uninformed native intuition about the difficult level of their language.[1] I deliberately refrain from calling them 'rules' since most people interpret that as a normative statement about language, which it isn't,2
The term correctness conditions has been taken from Ideology, Power, and Linguistic Theory by Prof G,2
K,2
Pullum.,2
 This is not really a dilemma if you handle it well,2
You can definitely teach your kid English without having to choose between making her 'lose her roots' or 'grow up to ridicule'.For the first 7-8 years of my life, I was raised by my mother's parents,2
My grandfather knew English but no one else in the house did,2
Moreover, I grew up in Madhya Pradesh (a core Hindi state) in a Marathi household,2
My grandfather is a thoroughly self-made man, and can be counted on to understand the impact of tiny (dis)advantages early in life,2
Just like you, he recognized the importance of me learning English,2
Being the only English speaker in the house, he'd often talk to me in English, and encourage me to reply in English, helping me figure out the best way to frame reply,2
He was my go-to English resource,2
I also went to a school where the medium of instruction was English,2
However, that doesn't ensure anything in itself.Kids don't usually like to learn if they know they are being 'made' to learn stuff,2
He'd employ interesting techniques to ensure that I absorbed things without being consciously aware of them,2
When I was learning to walk, he'd make me count my footsteps in English as I climbed up the stairs,2
Mind you, all this happened when I was less than 6 years old, a period particularly facile for language acquisition,2
By the time I was 7, I could talk fairly comfortably in English for a non-native speaker, and since I grew up in a Hindi / Marathi household, I had native competence in the two languages.During all this, however, I was also reading Hindi (and occasionally Marathi) newspapers and books and comics and what not,2
When I grew slightly older and started staying with my parents, they subscribed to kid magazines (in India, they'd be stuff like Champak or Balhans) in both Hindi and English,2
By the time I was 8, I was reading Hindi translations of Mir publication books such as Fun with Maths and Physics,2
I grew up fluent in all three languages, and due to my exposure to books such as the one I just mentioned, I am luckily comfortable even with technical vocabulary in Hindi,2
So yes, it is completely possible to raise your kid in a way that she picks up English, but please don't let her grow up in a monolingual environment, thereby wasting the natural advantage that most people growing up in India get,2
Immerse her in English, Hindi, and other languages too if possible,2
She gets to learn them 'for free' and she will thank you later! :)My own personal plan is to have my kid grow up exposed to at least 4 languages.,2
 What to do is sometimes said in levity while making a reference to Indian English, with constructions like "What to do yaar?" [What should I do, dude / mate]In Hindi, kya karoon? (which would be the closest match to What to do?) can be a standalone construction,2
However, in English, What to do? is not grammatically correct as a standalone utterance,2
It does not have a tensed verb,2
The verb to do here is in the infinitive form, and in itself cannot complete the sentence,2
What to do is actually a subordinate noun clause, and would be perfectly fine if used that way,2
Eg,2
I didn't know what to do.English is actually particularly finicky in this regard,2
It requires tensed verbs and subjects almost all the time.,2
 This sentence is perfectly correct, and anyone who says otherwise has been a victim of wrong grammar advice and is now propagating the same,2
Unlike what some people would have you believe, the use of they as a semantically singular gender-neutral word is not a new phenomenon of English inspired by feminist movements,2
In fact, it goes back in history to Chaucer!And whoso fyndeth hym out of swich blame,They wol come up...Chaucer, The Pardoners PrologueHere's singular they from Shakespeare:There's not a man I meet but doth salute meAs if I were their well-acquainted friendShakespeare, The Comedy of Errors, Act IV, Scene 3 (1594)Now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight;And every one to rest themselves betake,Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.Shakespeare, The Rape of LucreceOr Jane Austen: Who makes you their condant? (Jane Austen, Emma)Or Lewis CarrollWhoever lives there, thought Alice, itll never do to come uponthem this size; why, I should frighten them out of their wits![...]If everybody minded their own business, the duchess said in ahoarse growl, the world would go round a deal faster than itdoes,2
Lewis Carroll, Alice in WonderlandOr Oscar Wilde...at the end of the season when everyone has practically saidwhatever they had to sayLady Bracknell in Oscar Wildes The Importance of Being EarnestWe could go on and on,2
Singular they is perfectly grammatical, and extremely and consistently well-attested in the English language for at least 700 years.Go ahead and use it,2
If anyone says it's wrong, ask them for evidence, because they don't know what they are talking about.,2
 But what I do believe is that being a virgin myself and having decided not to lose it before marriage ( yeah! that may sound alien, but that is true!) , I deserve to ask for a virgin girl,2
Well, deserve is a fairly loaded kind of word, and I don't think you necessarily deserve anything in such a case, so it'd be best to not approach the issue with a sense of entitlement,2
Your decision to not have sex before marriage is just thatyour decision,2
Others may not care,2
That's theirs.At an individual level, it is of course perfectly alright for you to want a wife who shares your ideals of pre-marital celibacy, just like it is alright for you to have a preference for blue eyes or long hair or dimples or short height or whatever succeeds in generating the right chemical cocktail in your body,2
As far as possible, we should try not to police people's liking / preferences.But when individual desires get fossilized and institutionalized, an innocuous preference turns into a much more malevolent societal prejudice.Take, for instance, the issue of sex selection in India,2
At an individual level, it's perfectly fine to want to have a boy and not a girl,2
A lot of countries allow couples to 'choose' the sex of their child and the sex ratio of these countries has remained healthy despite this freedom,2
One hopes that in a large sample of parents, there will be many who'd want to have a girl, and many who'd want to have a boy, and the numbers would even out,2
But in a country like India, the desire to have a male child has institutionalized itself to the extent that it is no longer possible to expect things to remain in a natural equilibrium,2
In a similar fashion, virginity has historically and traditionally been associated with arbitrary notions of purity,2
We know that women have been at the receiving end of long-term institutionalized prejudice, and glorification of virginity is just one face of this many-headed monster,2
Your ideal of pre-marital celibacy is likely a channelization of the same mindset.And so, coming back to your question,2
No, it's not really objectionable for you as an individual to want a virgin wife, but you should understand how your innocuous choice isn't necessarily innocuous in the larger scheme of things,2
And you should understand why most women would take offence at this 'requirement' of yours.[PS: Some commenters are accusing me of 'bashing' OP,2
I am struggling to find parts of the answer which do this,2
I think I tried to explain the reason OP's 'choice' may be considered objectionable by people,2
This is what OP asked in the first place,2
If he wanted people to agree with him no matter what, he should not have posted the question on a public forum.Furthermore, some commenters have accused me of giving a 'societal' perspective to an 'individual' question,2
Well, I wrote at the outset that, as an individual, OP has the right to choose what he wants, but that it is important for him to distinguish his choice from his entitlements and to also understand why others find his choice problematic.],2
 One of the basic concepts of Unicode is that it abstracts the concept of 'letters' or 'characters' as we understand them in everyday usage from their representation.As the Wikipedia page for Unicode explains: The notion of a code point is used for abstraction, to distinguish both:the number from an encoding as a sequence of bits, andthe abstract character from a particular graphical representation (glyph).This is because one may wish to make these distinctions:encode a particular code space in different ways, ordisplay a character via different glyphs.,2
 Last month, I got one of the nicest compliments I could have gotten as a human being.A guy pinged me one day and, after a small preamble, came out to me,2
He then said that he had told only a couple of friends so far and that I was probably the 4th or 5th person to know,2
Now, a bunch of people have come out to me prior to this, and it's not a big deal,2
But in this case, I was a bit surprised because I didn't know him,2
He is a junior from my university, but we have probably just met on a couple of occasions.I told him I was totally fine with it, and that he could trust me, but that I was curious why he had chosen to tell me despite not knowing me well,2
He replied that he had read my answers on Quora and the stuff that I write on my blogs and that I came off as a tolerant and rational person, and so he felt safe telling me what was probably the biggest secret of his life.Frankly speaking, this is one of the warmest compliments anyone can get.I wrote this in my answer to Interpersonal Interaction: How can I make myself more broad-minded?, and I'd reiterate it hereWe don't exist in a vacuum,2
We are a part of a complex society and our actions contribute to the overall health of the society,2
Everything we say and do, especially in public places and public forums, can have invisible but strong influences.If you are the sort of guy who makes homophobic remarks just to look cool, you are helping create an environment where gay folks feel scared and insecure,2
If you are someone who makes boorish remarks about women, it doesn't matter then that you think 'rapists should be hanged' or that you participated in candle-lights vigils after the Delhi gang rape,2
The truth is that you also ended up contributing to creating a negative environment for women,2
So don't be such a person,2
We don't need to put on a cape to help people,2
There are easier, more effective ways.[Thanks to Anasuya for 'editorial work'],2
 The idea of a new Star Trek television series excites me,3
Star Trek belongs on television not in the cinema.BUT..,3
I am concerned that the series will be produced by Alex Kurtzman, one of the producers and writers of the Abrams Star Trek films,3
I did enjoy the first of those films, but the second one is beyond embarrassing,3
Star Trek Into Darkness is not the product of people that understand Star Trek,3
It is not the product of people that understand story-telling.Kurtzman's television productions are a mixed bag,3
On the bright side, he is one of the people that gave us Fringe,3
But, on the other side, he is one of the people that brought us Scorpion.As a writer, he has written terrible scripts for Transformers and Amazing Spider-Man 2,3
Hopefully he will stay out of the writer's room.This new Star Trek television series will be the flagship of CBS All Access, the digital streaming service of CBS,3
To watch the series, people will have to subscribe to that service for around $6 a month,3
That means it won't merely be a product that CBS hopes will bring them profits, it will be something that can greatly affect their larger corporate plans,3
That means they will probably feel compelled to be involved in the show in an editorial way,3
That didn't work out to well last time,3
I would much rather a company like Netflix was producing the series,3
Netflix appears to be much more comfortable allowing creative people to tell their stories the way they want to tell them.I'm very curious to know what the concept will be,3
It won't be Captain Kirk and Mr,3
Spock,3
Will it be the Enterprise? Will it be a starship on a five year mission? Will it be set in interstellar space or will it be set on a planet or starbase?The series I would like to see would go back to Gene Roddenberry's initial inspiration,3
Gene Roddenberry saw Captain Kirk as a futuristic Horatio Hornblower,3
The Hornblower novels, by C.S,3
Forester, follow Horatio throughout his career - from midshipman to Admiral of the Fleet,3
I would like to see a series that followed a character throughout their Starfleet career, starting with their first assignment and leading to their first command,3
The perspective of the audience would change as that character climbed the ladder,3
We'd see adventures from below decks during the first season, rarely seeing the bridge or the captain, similar to the excellent Star Next: The Next Generation season 7 episode "Lower Decks".What I most don't want to see is dark rooms,3
If you have the energy to power a warp drive and a transporter, you have energy to turn the damn lights on,3
I want a show that is bright figuratively and literally.Star Trek is incredibly important to me,3
It is a fictional world that I crave to visit,3
It has influenced every facet of my life,3
I so much want more of it, but I don't want it to be soiled.,3
 Not sure where you got the idea that 17 km/s is the escape velocity of the solar system,3
The escape velocity decreased with distance as depicted in the above graph.The above graph also illustrates the gravity assists that Voyager 2 did at each gas planet,3
Voyager's mission was to visit each of those planets,3
In order to do so, it had to be be at the same location as each planet as Voyager moved outwards,3
That means very precise velocities were required,3
If Voyager had been significantly faster at Jupiter, it would never have approached Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune.,3
 There was one American onboard ISS on that day, NASA astronaut Frank Culbertson,3
Frank had been tasked with collecting medical data on the crew,3
When he called down to the ground to report that data over a privatized loop, the flight surgeon explained to him what had happened,3
The event had a personal connection to Frank,3
A friend and Naval Academy classmate was the airline pilot of the plane that hit the Pentagon.Soon after completing that conversation, the ISS passed over New York and Frank went to the window and captured photographs and video of the burning towers.,3
 I listen to:Doctor Who: Radio Free SkaroDoctor Who: PodshockDoctor Who: The Impossible GirlsWhos Talking: A Doctor Who PodcastMy preference for them is in that order,3
Radio Free Skaro is run by three Canadian guys,3
They are long-time Whovians and participate in Who conventions,3
It's the most professional of the four podcasts,3
Podshock is an American guy and a British guy,3
The Impossible Girls is interesting because it is all female,3
They often see the episodes from a very different perspective than I do,3
The downside is that a few of them have very annoying speech patterns, including chronic use of "like".,3
 The story doesn't explicitly say,3
Dickens wrote the story in 1842-1843 and it was published for the 1843 Christmas season,3
The only mention of time in the story is when Scrooge asks the Ghost of Christmas Present "Have you had many brothers, Spirit? and the Ghost responds More than eighteen hundred." Since we know there is a new Ghost of Christmas Present each year, we know the story takes place more than 1800 years after the birth of Christ.The easiest assumption is to assume the story takes place on Christmas Eve 1843,3
But, the epilogue narration tells us:"Scrooge was better than his word,3
He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father,3
He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world."That leaves us to either assume the omniscient narrator is referring to the future or the story takes place far enough in the past that Ebenezer could become a better man before the story was told.,3
 More than two dozen,3
From the 1901 silent film called Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost to the 2009 full CGI 3D Jim Carrey version, A Christmas Carol is adapted for film, television, and stage perennially.I believe that the best version is the 1984 version, starring George C,3
Scott, David Warner, Susannah York, Roger Rees, and Edward Woodward,3
In addition to the strong performances from such a stellar cast, it is the version that I believe is most true both to the spirit and the setting of the film,3
Every year, I read the book, see the play, and watch this version,3
I can almost recite it from memory.An Incomplete List of Film Adaptations of A Christmas Carol1901 Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost1910 A Christmas Carol1935 Scrooge1938 A Christmas Carol1949 The Christmas Carol1951 Scrooge1953 It's Never Too Late1954 A Christmas Carol1956 The Stingiest Man in Town1969 A Christmas Carol1970 Scrooge1971 A Christmas Carol Animated1978 A Christmas Carol1979 An American Christmas Carol1983 Mickey's Christmas Carol1984 A Christmas Carol1986 A Christmas Carol1988 Scrooged1992 The Muppet Christmas Carol1998 Ebenezer1999 A Christmas Carol2000 A Christmas Carol2001 Christmas Carol: The Movie2005 Chasing Christmas2009 A Christmas Carol2012 A Christmas CarolIf that looks like a lot of films, that list would be absolutely dwarfed by the number of episodes of television series that adapt A Christmas Carol,3
Everything from The Twilight Zone to Blackadder to Beavis & Butthead has put their spin on the classic story,3
It is such a perfect story that everyone wants to tell it.,3
 Umm, most recently he has been killing it on the funniest sitcom on television (Veep),3
He didn't turn from comedy,3
There is no point in his career when he only accepted serious roles.Early in his career, he was certainly best known for comedy, with hits like A Bit of Fry and Laurie, Blackadder, and The Young Ones,3
But, as far back as 1985's Plenty, starring Meryl Streep, he has done dramatic work,3
In 1993, he starred in a miniseries called All or Nothing at All as a conman addicted to gambling.While he was doing both comedy and drama on House, he did quite a bit of comedic side work, such as voicing the character of Dr,3
Cockroach PhD in several Dreamworks productions.,3
 You mean besides movies like Legend, Clue, Pass the Ammo, The Hunt for Red October, Oscar, Passed Away, Loaded Weapon 1, The Three Musketeers, The Shadow, Congo, Lover's Knot, McHale's Navy, Four Dogs Playing Poker, Sorted, Charlie's Angels, Scary Movie 2, The Scoundrel's Wife, Ritual, Kinsey, and Burke and Hare?And besides television like Wiseguy, It, Roseanne, Earth 2, The Naked Truth, Over the Top, Lexx: The Dark Zone, The Net, Martial Law, Rude Awakening, Attila, Family Affair, Monk, Will & Grace, Alice, Cranford, and Criminal Minds?He has certainly been very, very successful as a voice actor in animation, but he has also had a career in serious film and television that most actors would envy.Besides Rocky Horror, he is probably best know for playing Pennywise the clown in the Stephen King mini-series, It - a clown that is not child friendly.,3
 It's a great show,3
I've seen him in concert, twice - once in Napa and once in Houston,3
The first concert was after his album Let Them Talk and the second after his album Didn't It Rain.Hugh Laurie is a talented singer and musician and he's supported by the excellent Copper Bottom Band,3
He cycles back and forth between the guitar, piano, and just standing at the mic.Hugh is extremely knowledgeable about early American blues, jazz, and bluegrass,3
The concert is mostly those types of music and he accompanies the songs with interesting stories about the originators,3
His love for the art is evident and enthusiastic,3
He's not a stage hog,3
Everyone in his band gets their solo.There are quite a few videos from his concerts, on Youtube,3
I'm not sure if any of them are authorized, so I'm not embedding one, here.,3
 In the book, Mark takes up about half a page explaining what happened to his suit,3
That would be pure gobbledygook on the screen,3
Everyone in the audience saw Mark get hit by the antenna,3
Everyone in the audience saw that he was impaled by part of the antenna,3
Everyone in the audience can figure out that an impaled spacesuit leaks,3
No explanation was needed by going with the simplest explanation,3
It didn't change the story at all,3
It would have been silly to go with the same explanation as used in the novel.As for accuracy in the book, spacesuits with oxygenators like the one in the book don't exist,3

 They aren't painted white,3
There are a variety of colored surfaces, each functional.Most of the module surfaces are metallic,3
In the below picture we can see many metal panels,3
Those are meteor shields,3
Below those shields are thermal blankets and below the blankets is an aluminum hull.Most of the areas that appear white are not paint, but exposed thermal blanket (AKA beta cloth),3
Look closely at this picture and you can see the fabric,3
The beta cloth is white because white reflects heat.There are some surfaces and boxes with a white coating,3
That coating is white, again for thermal reasons,3
There are also some boxes with a black coating, also for thermal reasons,3
Those are boxes that we don't want to get cold.,3
 He already did,3
It ran for 13 episodes in 1966,3
They are on Youtube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...If the follow on question is - okay, but what about a new series? Well, in the current cartoon climate, that is unlikely,3
Currently, superhero cartoons are not purchased by networks like Cartoon Network unless they are toy sellers,3
Well received and viewed cartoons like Teen Titans and Green Lantern were cancelled not because of ratings, but simply because they were not resulting in toy sales.Captain America, solo, is not going to push as many toys as Captain America with the Avengers,3
Neither is Thor or Iron Man.,3
 I don't believe he is negative about the films,3
To the contrary, he has been quite positive,3
He has repeatedly praised Sam Mendes work as director on Spectre and Skyfall,3
He has repeatedly said how grateful he is for the quality of the script in Casino Royale that allowed him to be Bond, rather than just impersonate past Bonds.Any negative remarks he has made have been about the exhausting process of making the films,3
They are massive films that put a lot of pressure on the star,3
They are physically demanding films that strain the body - work on Spectre had to cease for a few weeks while he had knee surgery after an on-set injury,3
They are films that require a lot of travel, keeping him away from his family,3
He's just exhausted and wants a break.There are two things that have to be understood to understand the context of his remarks:1) Craig is English,3
Sarcasm is as essential as breathing, for him,3
One has to understand sarcasm to understand his remarks.2) He doesn't enjoy spending hour after hour with stupid journalist after stupid journalist,3
These big movies require press events where the actors sit in a hotel suite while journalist after journalist is put in front of them and given a few minutes to ask the same idiotic questions the last forty stupid journalists asked,3
Going through an experience like that makes one lose track of how many different people are asking the questions,3
It starts to feel like the same person is asking the same question,3
Imagine that instead of talking about the current film, you were getting asked over and over if you want to make another one,3
Wouldn't you eventually try to make it stop by using hyperbole and saying something like "I'd rather cut my wrists with this bottle!" I sure as hell would,3
Look at this clip,3
Wouldn't you want to throw this journalist through a window?https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sj...The same thing happens here on Quora - on a much smaller scale - We get asked the same questions over and over and over,3
That sometimes results in using a little sarcasm and hyperbole, hoping it will stop the nonsense.,3
 The cast had been playing those roles for 15 years,3
They knew their characters,3
They were protective of those characters,3
They knew what makes Star Trek,3
Stuart Baird had never seen an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation,3
He didn't know the world,3
He didn't know the characters.That created friction whenever Baird required the actors to do something their characters wouldn't do.Star Trek: Nemesis doesn't feel like Star Trek,3
The characters are not true to their fifteen years of history,3
It's a bad film,3
It was not a fitting sendoff for the actors and they know that.,3
 The orange suits (affectionately called pumpkin suits) are not spacesuits,3
They are worn only while inside a vehicle that is ascending or descending through the atmosphere,3
Their primary purpose is to protect the crew member from the adverse effects of a depressurization inside the vehicle,3
They are orange because orange creates a high contrast against the background for rescue crews looking for the crew members in the water or on land.The current white suits are spacesuits,3
They are designed for use outside the vehicle, in the vacuum of space,3
They are designed to provide a pressurized environment, thermal control, and protection against tears and punctures.,3
 The last twenty minutes of the film were all about trying to match the velocity and position of the Hermes with the velocity and position of the MAV,3
The crew of the Hermes had to go to extreme lengths to try to get themselves closer to the MAV.The MAV was designed to transport the crew from the Martian surface to Mars orbit where it would rendezvous with the Hermes,3
The problem during the last twenty minutes of the film is that the trajectory that returned the Hermes to Mars was not low or slow enough for the MAV to reach,3
The Hermes was not entering a parking orbit, it was doing a high speed loop around Mars and then back to Earth.Therefore, the objective on the ground was for Watney to reduce the mass of the MAV so that it could reach a greater altitude and higher speed.,3

 The special, titled The Day of the Doctor, was simulcast in 94 countries across six continents, in 15 languages,3
While that has been done for realtime events like the World Cup, it had never been done for a television drama.The special was also shown live in 1500 cinemas,3
I had the pleasure of being at the largest single gathering of fans to watch it,3
2200 of us congregated in one room to watch it live at Austin Comic Con.That's not the only Guinness World Record that Doctor Who holds,3
It was also recently recorded as the longest running sci-fi series.,3
 I can't imagine any other actor portraying Steve Rogers and Captain America with such verisimilitude.From the his first scene, we can see the determination, goodness, and spirit in the scrawny kid from Brooklyn,3
When Dr,3
Erskine says to Steve, "The serum amplifies everything that is inside,3
So, good becomes great,3
Bad becomes worse,3
This is why you were chosen,3
Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power,3
But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.""Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing,3
That you must stay who you are,3
Not a perfect soldier, but a good man."We buy it, because Evans has so convinced us that this kid is the right person to become Captain America.And then we see Steve step out of the chamber, transformed and bare chested,3
Evans has the physicality that looks like he stepped out of the comic book page.Evans brings Cap's earnestness, sadness, integrity, and bravery to life without a hint of irony or cheese.,3
 There are two wolves who are always fighting.One is darkness and despair.The other is light and hope.The question is: which wolf wins?The one you feed.Casey learned that old Indian legend from her father,3
She repeats it throughout the film,3
It is the central idea of the story,3
She and Athena are driven by that idea,3
Young Frank was, but adult Frank has started to feed the wrong wolf and Casey has to bring him back,3
Nix has been corrupted by his obsession with the wrong wolf.If we want a bright future, we have to see a bright future,3
We have to feed that future,3
The film has a couple of small jokes about movies with apocalyptic titles,3
The film isn't saying that such movies are bad, but it is saying that if all of our visions of the future are dystopian, how can we expect a future that isn't dystopian? We need to see the future we want - we need to see Tomorrowland.The film is about optimism and the wonderful things we can do, if we believe we can do them,3
There's a common refrain about the present in which people say "Where are the jetpacks and flying cars we were promised?" In the film, young Frank says "I got tired of waiting for my jetpack, so I built one."Walt Disney believed in projecting the future he wanted to see,3
He built Tomorrowland, at Disneyland, to be an exciting, positive view of what can be,3
Walt's dream, was to actually build the city of the future,3
He bought all of that land in Florida not just to build Disneyworld but to build a city called EPCOT (Experimental Protoype City of Tomorrow),3
At the center of that city would be research facilities for all of the major companies in America,3
It would be a city dedicated to the future,3
Unfortunately Walt died before ground was broken and the project faded away.,3
 If an actor starves themselves for months and becomes emaciated, for a single scene, they sure as hell aren't going to have a towel over their head for that scene,3
They are going to make sure you know it is them.The Martian was filmed on a very short schedule,3
There wasn't time for a hiatus while the lead actor starved himself.Matt may have been willing to lose weight for the role, but he's in his forties now,3
It would be a lot harder than it was when he did it for Courage Under Fire,3
Doing it for that film seriously affected his health,3
He was on medication for 18 months because of the damage caused to his adrenal system.,3
 White wine was very common for the ancient Sumerians, Egyptians, Romans, and Greeks,3
Atheneus wrote of the excellent white wine from Alexandria,3
Several years ago, evidence of white wine was found in King Tut's tomb.The Greek Retsina, still popular today, has been a staple for over two-thousand years,3
The island of Santorini built its fame on white wines made from athiri and aidini grapes as far back as Neolithic times.Homer's Odyssey refers to straw wine - a white wine made from dehydrated grapes.There are many mentions of white Falernian wine in Roman literature,3
Pliny mentions it several times, including talking about it being served at a banquet for Julius Caesar.,3
 Because the Marvel Cinematic Universe is inspired by the Marvel Comics Universe, and in the comics, more money can be made by going with choice (A) than choice (B).Choice A: sell the following comics each month:Iron ManCaptain AmericaThorBlack WidowHawkeyeIncredible HulkThe AvengersChoice B: sell the following comics each month:The AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersI believe the same would apply to the films.This is a very common question from people that aren't more than casual comic book fans,3
They often ask things like"Why didn't Iron Man help Captain America when SHIELD was after him in Captain America: The Winter Soldier?" or "Why didn't the Avengers help Spider-man save New York in Spider-Island?" The answer is "Because it's not their &@$*ing movie/comic!"If every time Batman got into trouble, he called Superman, Wonder Woman, or the Flash to bail him out, Batman would cease to be an interesting hero,3
The title character needs to be the hero of their title.It's not about reality, it's about telling good stories.,3
 There are two things to talk about, here: continuity and creative teams.ContinuityContinuity is a mixed blessing,3
It is essential to world-building and creating the serial aspect of comics that keeps the industry alive,3
The industry depends on those fans that purchase multiple titles every month because they don't want to miss out on a stitch of the tapestry,3
But, it is also a stifling burden, that constricts creators more and more each year,3
Superman and Batman have appeared in comic books every month for the last 75 years,3
Many of the Marvel characters are entering their fifth decade of publication,3
During that time, these characters have been kept in a recycling status quo,3
Both Marvel and DC utilize floating timelines that maintain that all of the stories have occurred in the last 10 years,3
These characters are worth more as licensing properties than as comic book characters,3
That means that they can't really change.Imagine you are a comic book writer,3
Your job is to write interesting stories that will captivate audiences and sell books,3
You are restricted in how much you can change about the characters,3
You also have to deal with the massive history of the characters,3
How do you write a Batman versus Joker story that is in continuity with every other Batman versus Joker story told in the last 75 years? That's hundreds of stories,3
How do you even maintain the plausibility that Batman would return the Joker to Arkham over and over and over again, knowing the Joker will escape and kill innocents?"Continuity holds the best writer hostage of the worst." - Marv Wolfman (writer of Crisis on Infinite Earths)"Continuity is the devil,3
Continuity is the devil! Its awful,3
It makes for bad stories, right? Because suddenly, well, wait a second, you said Wolverine hates ham sandwiches, hes clearly eating a ham sandwich! Thats trivia,3
 But consistencys important,3
Like with what Dan said, its about truth to character,3
The rest is ultimately trivia, and time isnt really time in comics, you know?" - Matt Fraction (writer of Hawkeye)The nice thing about coming in to write the New 52 is I dont have to worry about what came before the New 52,3
That stuff is great and it can serve as inspiration, but continuity is the devil,3
As a writer, having to slavishly make sense of too much continuity can kill a story,3
Yes, you want to stay true to the spirit of things, and continuity can absolutely be your friend in creating resonance and a sense of history and paying off certain emotional things  but: It was a beautiful, beautiful thing for me walking into the New 52 and being able to look at a small range of stories that had been told, and those are the things that are set in stone, and the rest of it we can make up as we go,3
We can build the stories that make sense for our characters in order to tell the emotional story that were telling,3
- Greg Pak (writer of World War Hulk)It is the editor's job to govern continuity,3
They have to balance ensuring the story fits into the ongoing universe of the comics with allowing creators to tell their best stories,3
Judgement calls have to be made,3
Not everything in the last 75 years was good,3
Mistakes were made, bad stories were written,3
Is it okay for a writer in 2015 to contradict a bad and forgotten story from 1973? Or must every writer in perpetuity be constrained by the choices of that long ago writer? Creative TeamsThe crux of your question is about having multiple writers work on characters,3
Believe it or not, it is often more desirable to a publisher to have a creator on a title for a short period than a long period,3
Ultimately, comics is a business,3
It is their job to try to sell more books this month than last month,3
One thing that is almost guaranteed to cause an increase in sales is a change in creative team,3
Put "New Creative Team!" On the cover in giant font and people that didn't buy the book last month will buy it this month,3
Readers often say it is difficult to know when to jump into a book,3
Readers also become complacent and bored,3
That's why publishers like to remember so often,3
Putting an "Issue #1" or "First Issue" on the cover tells people - "start here!"There are, of course, exceptions,3
There are star writers whose names sell books,3
Marvel will let Brian M,3
Bendis stay on a book as long as he wants to, just as DC will for Geoff Johns.Often, the change is not a choice of the publisher,3
Writers come onto a book with a plan for the story or stories they want to tell,3
When that is done, they want to move on,3
They want to do other things,3
They may only have one six issue story about Spider-man to tell,3
Then they want to tell their six-issue story about Batman.And finally, characters like Spider-man, Batman, Superman, and Wolverine can support multiple titles a month,3
So, in a given month, by necessity, one writer will be using Batman in Batman and another will be using him in Detective Comics, and a third in Justice League.,3
 I moved to India in 2008 for more treatment and options for my health,4
If you don't know what happened to me, I suggest you read: Virali Modi's answer to What does it feel like to survive death?.In 2008, I weighed 75kgs, I was paralyzed from my chest down,4
I had some movement in my arms, but they weren't strong enough for me to be completely independent,4
My mom and I moved to India, leaving my father behind in America (so he could provide financial stability),4
It was incredibly difficult leaving behind the United States and of course my father,4
What made it even more difficult is the fact that I didn't know Hindi (a widely spoken language), I could only understand it,4
The only languages I knew were English and Gujarati (my mother tongue).On top of that, when we landed in Mumbai, the next day, we took a train to Delhi for an ayurvedic treatment,4
This treatment required my mom and I to stay there for a month (coincidentally, my birthday month),4
I was given digusting medicines to drink and pills to swallow, oil massages in which I couldn't shower for a couple of days, and head massages which left my hair oily and gross looking,4
I was also put on a strict diet which, in retrospect, wasn't really healthy,4
The people there knew no English, which made it hard for me to communicate with them, because I couldn't speak Hindi,4
The treatment didn't help me at all,4
It was a failure, I saw no improvements, even when I continued the medicines at home for over a year.During that year, I also underwent another treatment which was kind of the same, but the men that would massage my legs, would come home,4
The oil was a mixture of herbs, oils, and seeds  which smelt horrible,4
I was sexually assaulted by one of the men there, so we stopped the treatment, after doing it for over five months,4
This treatment didn't yeild any positive effects, either.For the next two years, I underwent so many different treatments; you name it, I've done it,4
I also went to several astrologers/fortune tellers, because back then everyone kept saying that someone's done black magic on me, which I never believed,4
We spent so much money behind these treatments, astrologers, and fortune tellers,4
As you can imagine, there were no improvements,4
I was the same as I was in 2008.In 2010, I came across a treatment known as Stem Cell Therapy in Mumbai,4
I went there, I met the doctor and the therapists, and got an evaluation done,4
They explained the treatment in such detail and showed me their results and research (I also did my own research), that I was content and ecstatic with it,4
I went ahead and booked my stay there for the stem cells,4
I've been going to Neurogen for approximately five years now, and I haven't looked back,4
I was 75kgs, short, stumpy, and paralyzed; Now I'm 52kgs, average height, healthy, and I'm able to feel contractions of my legs muscles,4
I'm getting better, and I haven't believed in any other treatment, more than I believe in this.I can definitely say that my treatments, the experiences I've had with other people, and the unfortunate events that I've been through has made my risk (moving to India) worthwhile,4
My health has greatly approved, I have over 43k followers on Quora, I'm gradually gaining fame, and one of my favorite directors (of Bollywood), Mr,4
Nagesh Kukunoor tweeted about one of my newest written article, which has made me ecstatic!,4
 Just this year when I went to Zimbabwe for my boyfriend's sister's wedding, I was shunned by all of the kids my age,4
Apparently some of the elders were talking trash about me to his parents,4
They were saying stuff about me being on a wheelchair, about me influencing Dhyaan (my boyfriend) to leave his parents, and other bad stuff which I don't want to share,4
Dhyaan's cousins started creating drama too,4
They'd leave me alone and go out for lunch, they'd play games and wouldn't include me  just really childish things,4
Dhyaan wouldn't be home most of the day because he was still working during the three weeks when I was there (they distanced the music night/engagement, mehendi night, wedding, and reception into three weeks, so the guests coming from out of the country could stay around and go sightseeing).When Dhyaan would come home, he'd see me sitting all alone on the sofa, playing with my phone,4
His parents were also influenced, unfortunately, and were acting as if they didn't care,4
Keep in mind, this was my first time meeting them, they shouldn't have secluded me, but I don't blame them (I'll explain more later),4
Dhyaan also heard about all the shunning and rumors, he took action on it, but silently.He would come sit next to me on the sofa, hold my hand, and he'd kiss my cheek, in front of his whole family,4
He'd talk to me about his day, and then we'd go outside for a walk, across the street and just sit on the benches and relax in the cold night air,4
Sometimes we'd go out to his backyard and we'd play with his dog, Milo,4
He made it known to his family that their words made no difference to him, he was proud to have me (and vice versa), and he loved me.Coming to his parents; the wedding was a very stressful time for them, there was a huge water and electricity problem, on top of that almost everyone got sick with a virus, which turned out to be Typhoid (but thankfully we all had our vaccinations for Typhoid, but still managed to get a cold and fever)  the bride was in bad shape, and as you can imagine, some members of the family were pinpointing his parents about me,4
His parents reacted like normal people, and I don't blame them,4
They apologized to me and my mom, and everything's perfect now,4
Most of you may not know this, but Dhyaan and I met online,4
Dhyaan's father chose me for him, and that's why Dhyaan and I are together,4
His parents and I get along well  better than before, and we speak whenever possible,4
Because of this incident, the relationship between us has become stronger.I was very reluctant to share this story, because it makes Dhyaan's parents look bad, but they really aren't,4
Anyone can become confused and can get quickly influenced when they're under stress,4
I request you to not say anything mean about his parents, because I care for them and they care for me,4
They aren't in the wrong.,4
 Do you know what you should've done when she was giving you hints? I think you should've asked her if she liked you and was indicating a relationship, if she would've said yes, you could have told her exactly what you told us (that you had prior commitments),4
You could've asked her to wait, and none of this would've happened,4
Usually, the biggest mistakes we make are all communication related,4
I'm not trying to discourage you by saying this, but I want you to understand this for your future.Look, she's happy with her boyfriend and you're happy for her, even though you're miserable,4
If you keep letting her control your life, you will never move on,4
If she keeps staying in your heart, you won't have room for another person (that might be your true love),4
Three years is a long time, you need to move on,4
You need to go out there, live your life, hang out with your friends, and you need to be productive,4
She deserves to be happy, but so do you!Try meeting new people, try engaging in thought provoking conversations, try different cuisines, go traveling, basically just do something different and adventurous,4
Think of it this way; after getting in another relationship, you might not have the time or the resources to participate in different things because of a relationship,4
You have that time now! Go out there and do something different,4
These different experiences will help you grow and mature as a person.Look, if you don't want to do all that, then join a gym,4
Working out can do wonders for your emotional and pyshical health,4
A good physique can give you major confidence, and lifting heavy weights can be a good stress buster,4
An added bonus: A good physique will definitely help you in the ladies department,4
Joining the gym and working out may just help you make friends, and possibly help you find a companion.All of these things are destractions to help you forget about that girl,4
If you really want to forget her, implement some of the things I've said (and other people will say),4
Other than that, it's really upto you,4
If you really want to forget her, you need to work on it,4
Time will help heal wounds, but those urges to talk and wish for more, need to stop.Hopefully this helps,4
Good luck, OP.,4
 Congratulations for your relationship! Long distance relationships are really hard to maintain, I know from experience,4
I guess your parents are doubtful because LDRs don't usually work out,4
I suppose they think it won't work out in the end.A word of advice, don't worry so much about this,4
Keep focusing on your relationship, keep putting effort into it, and keep loving your partner,4
By making this relationship a success, you'll be able to prove your parents wrong  and they'll be very happy to be proven wrong.,4
 No.Everything up until I came out of my coma is still hazy,4
I don't remember much or anything at all, to be completely honest,4
I don't remember as vividly as other memories of how I became sick [1],4
I don't remember when, how, or why I became comatose,4
All I do remember is the dream [2] I had during those twenty-three days,4
The dream I had was what was happening to my body at that exact moment.I don't know if this is the case with all coma patients, but my memory was greatly affected,4
I still have trouble remembering things,4
I have a tremendously weak long term memory, but my short term memory is quite good,4
There are many things that I don't remember from my past  things that happened before I got sick,4
Even now, I have trouble remembering things, people, names, and incidents.The weird thing about this memory problem is that I'm able to remember traumatic events in my life that caused me grief,4
I cannot remember good and happy memories.[1] Virali Modi's answer to What does it feel like to survive death?[2] Virali Modi's answer to Do people dream during comas?,4
 I met my current partner through shaadi.com,4
Weirdly enough, he wasn't using his profile when he found me  his dad was,4
It turned out that his father saw me, called his son over, and told him to talk to me,4
According to my boyfriend, his dad said that I was pretty, intelligent (based off of my description), and I seemed like a cool person.Well, he expressed and interest in me, but I declined him because of superficial reasons; his pictures on the website were not at all attractive, plus he stays in Africa,4
A couple of days later, he messaged me on Facebook and we started talking  I had no idea who he was until he told me that I declined him on Shaadi,4
As you can imagine, I was really embarrassed, but we quickly forgot and instantly clicked.It's going to be two years next month, and he's planning on shifting to Mumbai permanently next year.,4
 It doesn't matter if you're serious about your boyfriend or not, you're in a relationship and infidelity shouldn't be the answer to your question,4
I'm sure you wouldn't like it if your boyfriend cheated on you, no matter how horny he was.Coming to the part about your lonliness, go to the movies, read a book, or binge watch a TV series,4
I think being alone can be truly beautiful, you have the time to discover yourself both emotionally and physically,4
Take advantage of that.You're horny, masturbate,4
It's really that simple,4
Otherwise, watch porn,4
Just don't cheat on your boyfriend, no matter if it's a casual relationship or not; unless and until it's okay with the both of you.,4
 After reaching fourty thousand followers, I expected to be stopped on the street, at the mall, or even interrupted during dinner by some of my followers,4
I mean, fourty thousand is a lot of people,4
Guess what? That never happened,4
Initially, I was upset,4
Not because people didn't recognize me, but because I could never hear people say the wonderful things I get to read in my Quora messages,4
I get the most beautiful messages from my followers which explains the direct or indirect effect I've had on their lives,4
I always wanted to hear the stories of my followers, how my answers helped change them, what they did different than me, how they motivated someone in their life,4
Unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet.To be honest, it's totally okay that I'm famous on Quora yet I'm not widely recognized in real life,4
I suppose I get my privacy this way,4
On the bright side, I usually end up in tears when I read messages from my followers; at least I won't be crying in front of them.,4
 A couple of weeks ago I had gone out partying for my birthday (it was an early celebration),4
Well, my friends and one of my cool uncles had come along (my mom didn't come),4
We went out to a lounge and he was forcing me to drink (because it was my birthday and according to him, I should be sloshed),4
I told him to call my mom to tell her that I'll be drinking (the place was loud and wasn't extremely accessible for me to leave to make the call),4
He told me not to worry because he'd handle it,4
Guess what immature, stupid Virali did? I trusted him and I drank, a lot,4
I usually don't drink more than I can handle, but my uncle kept insisting, so I did.Well, I blacked out, the last thing I remember is that we were dancing, and then nothing,4
The next morning, I wake up and see my mom staring at me,4
She started yelling, saying how I was immature and irresponsible (which I agreed to),4
I told her the story and she called my uncle  he lied,4
He said that I was already drunk before I met him, which wasn't the case,4
As you can imagine, things got pretty heated at home,4
That's when my dad called.Dad - "Beta, what happened last night? How much did you drink?"Me - (I told him the whole story) "Dad, I'm so sorry, I promise it won't happen again,4
Whatever he was saying was lies." (I kept going on and on)Dad - "It's okay, I believe you,4
Relax, it happens sometimes,4
You don't have to apologize as long as you've realized your mistake,4
A word of advice, dear: Don't trust anyone, especially if you're drinking,4
People will take advantage of the situation and they will manipulate words in order to make you look bad,4
Just understand that."Me - "Okay dad, I'll make sure of that,4
Thanks, pops,4
I love you."Dad - "I love you too sweets,4
Here, let me talk to your mom, she must be fuming."I gave my mom the phone and he calmed her down and spoke to her,4
She suddenly relaxed and gave me the same advice my dad did,4
I don't blame my mom for her reaction, someone could've taken a physical advantage of me in my passed out state,4
I realized where I was wrong and promised her and my father that I'd never do it again.Since I was born, my father has always been a workaholic, I wasn't ever technically raised by him,4
Yes, he'd always give me words of wisdom and would help me through issues, but my mom mostly raised me,4
My dad would always be the saviour whenever I was wrong,4
My mom has a bad temper, while my dad is really relaxed and cool headed,4
He's the one who'll calm my mom down, help me understand my mistake, and will look at a situation in a different prespective.,4
 Even inspite of an arranged marriage, your wife picked you,4
It wasn't forced nor was was she blackmailed into marrying you,4
Your wife obviously saw something special in you that others couldn't recognize.Do me a favor, why don't you tell your wife everything you said in your description,4
Let us know what she says,4
I think she'll be angry at you,4
She'll be hurt that you think you deserve the mockery and that you're going along with it.Your colleagues have no right to judge your relationship, especially on your looks,4
You should be proud that you have a beautiful wife who loves and cares for you,4
You shouldn't be worrying about other people,4
You also shouldn't be joining in on their mockery of you.,4
 I want fame,4
I want to be famous, not only for me, but for the people whose voice isn't heard.We have activists and NGOs for every possible cause, even for disability but it isn't as famous as other causes,4
That doesn't mean it's not important, it just isn't heard as widely as others,4
I want fame to spread awareness for those whom are disabled,4
We deserve the proper infrastructure, the community needs understanding, and there needs to be proper awareness.I feel like I'm repeating myself, but this is incredibly important,4
Maybe even more important than others think.,4
 I don't work, but I do go for therapy and the gym which equals about eight hours of my life, including traveling time,4
This might sound corny but I started to watch Friends again, mainly because it makes me laugh and destresses me,4
I think laughter is the biggest energy drink there is,4
It's the best way to reenergize yourself.Another thing that helps is to spend time with family,4
After getting home, I spend time with my parents and talk to my boyfriend; we're people who like to share  maybe even overshare parts of our day, and usually it turns into a laughing contest,4
Even if there isn't much to talk about, it's nice to have a cup of coffee/tea with each other.The best thing, in my opinion, is to have a home cooked meal,4
I stay with my parents, so having my mom prepare something with her loving hands always cheers me up and brings me joy,4
Especially if it's something that's my favorite.TL;DR: Laughter, family, love, and food.,4
 Yesterday I was at the mall when I saw a Tarot Card booth that was owned by two ladies,4
Well, I sat down and she told me to pick five cards and to ask a question,4
I asked, "When will I start walking?" She told me that she won't be able to give me the exact time but she'll give me whatever message the cards show her,4
I picked out five cards and almost immediately she said, "You worry too much,4
You need to stop thinking and worrying about your future,4
Sometimes things are meant to happen more quickly, but by doubting yourself and thinking too many negative things  like asking yourself 'what if' questions, you're promoting negative energy to enter your heart and mind, which causes the positivity to lessen and eventually, it disappears." Look, I don't believe in fortune telling, palmistry, astrology, and other forms of fortune reading,4
I believe in hard work that comes from deep within the heart,4
I'll tell you something though, her words hit me like stone,4
I felt that she was extremely right,4
I do think too much about my future, especially about my legs,4
You won't believe this, but I do ask myself, "What if I don't walk? What will I do? How will I survive?" Shocking, right?Guess what I did today? I went to therapy, and from this morning, I stopped thinking about my future and my legs,4
After therapy, I realized what kind of positive effect it had on me,4
I had improvements,4
My muscles and genuine movements had improved,4
I don't know if this is coincidence or if it's actually because I stopped thinking about myself and my legs.Why am I telling you this? Well, I think you should stop thinking about the future,4
Everyone has some mishaps in their life, whether it be because of education or because of money,4
You cannot keep thinking about that specific mishap and how it might affect your future; because it will affect your future, but for the better,4
Start thinking of other options for your career, you might not be destined to do what you initially planned on,4
You should always have a backup plan, even for your backup plan,4
I think that's incredibly important,4
You think you're not fit? Why don't you start going to the gym? The gym will help you vent your frustration and it'll help you get fit and you'll lose some weight,4
Along with that, start devoting your time to things that are important to you, hang out with your friends, and try looking at different options to help you with your future.In short: Stop worrying so much and try living your life without thinking too much about your future.,4
 To be honest, I haven't hidden anything from my parents,4
I realized, at a very young age, that my parents would be the only ones who'd take my side if the world was against me,4
They'd help me through anything if I told them the whole truth.At a young age I did hide things from my parents, and I paid a price,4
People were spreading rumors about me that weren't true and I didn't know what to do,4
It was mainly because I went to a party and had a little too much to drink,4
I was only fourteen years old and I was rebellious,4
My mom constantly saw my long face everyday and would ask me why I was upset, but I couldn't tell her.When I finally did, she was upset with me,4
She shouted, because drinking at such a young age was really unheard of in my family,4
To be honest, it was stupid of me to do that,4
After all the waterworks were done, she gave me some advice and I implemented it,4
Guess what? The rumors died off.That's when she told me, "People in this world are just waiting for a reason to talk about you, put you down, and to hurt you,4
Not everyone is a well-wisher,4
You shouldn't trust people so easily,4
Be yourself and be wise,4
The only people that'll be there for you are your parents,4
Dad and I will always be there for you, no matter what,4
We'll help you through anything, as long as you tell us the truth."From that day on, I've respected her wishes and quickly realized that she was extremely right,4
They've helped me through so much and are so loving and supportive that I have no reason to hide anything from them,4
Our family of three shares everything with each other, and when we actually have to keep a secret, it's difficult  really difficult,4
I wouldn't have it any other way.,4
 I smile.Sure, it doesn't sound like much and I won't compare it to donating for good causes, but it's something that helps me feel better and it also affects other people, in a positive way,4
Smiling is a small gesture that doesn't cost anything, is effortless, and is actually really good for you.Personally, when I have a bad day and I don't feel happy or good about myself, a smile from a stranger really helps me,4
It's like an indirect messaging saying, "Keep holding on and being strong, you're doing just fine,4
We all go through it, but keep being you and keep thinking positive thoughts." At least that's what a smile means to me.Another thing that I try to do everyday is to compliment at least one person,4
Look, people have bad days and they fight battles that are unknown to us,4
Sometimes a simple compliment can make someone feel that they're appreciated,4
It can make them feel good about themselves,4
Yes, it's happened to me,4
Often, I get complimented about my smile or my weight and it makes me feel so good about myself that I stop worrying,4
It brightens up my day,4
You never know whose day you'll make better by smiling and complimenting them.,4
 Here's the thing: Indians have populated the majority of Quora, that's a known fact,4
There are a couple of things that irk me, which I'd like to mention,4
There are users on here (not particularly Indian) that ask troll questions, simple questions that can be Googled, questions that are demaning and sexist (which are very, very hurtful and controversial), and ask questions before checking for similar questions,4
There are also those who write troll answers; the reason I say that the majority of such offences are Indians is because if you check the "collapsed answers", it's mostly filled with collapsed answers of Indians,4
This ticks me off,4
Please, read the rules, look at Deepak Mehta's description for an introduction to Quora, it'll really help,4
Their ignorance is making my feed a nightmare to look at,4
There are also people who are silent readers,4
They read, upvote, comment, edit answers and questions, and do the needful in terms of merging questions,4
I really appreciate you,4
There are also people who provide answers, most of them are helpful and I think more people should provide more inputs if they're comfortable.I think Indians on Quora is a great idea, we have a place to express ourselves without being judged (hopefully),4
I think we should be doing more to prevent it from becoming Yahoo Answers.,4
 I ask myself that question everyday,4
I always wonder how I became so famous,4
To be honest, I'm not someone extraordinary,4
I'm a normal girl who had some unfortunate events occur in my life,4
I think what makes me famous is my never-give-up attitude,4
Despite being wheelchair bound for about nine years, going through difficult situations, and being betrayed by almost everyone in my life, I've realized that I'm the most important person to me and that I should love who I am, no matter what,4
Along with that, I think my determination to prove everyone wrong is what is admirable,4
I'm determined to follow and accomplish my dreams of being an actress, no matter my physical condition.,4

When applying mascara to my bottom lashes, I make sure I use the mascara wand to "stamp" my lower lashline so it looks like I used some eyeliner,4
This trick helps me save time and it gives definition to my lower lashline without using another product.2,4
If I don't have the blush color I want, I use a lipstick of the same color and apply it to my cheeks like a cream blush,4
This gives me a luminous finish without having to use an illuminator on my cheeks, plus I can use drugstore lipsticks to achieve the perfect cheek color without spending an excessive amount of money.3,4
For a quick bun, I gather my hair into a ponytail in my hand, then I twist the hair and loop it around itself on my head and use a hair tie to fasten it,4
It literally takes one minute.4,4
For extremely soft feet and hands, I apply a heavy duty moisturizer for dry skin and enclose my feet in thick socks over night,4
The next morning, I'm left with soft feet and hands,4
If you don't have a heavy duty moisturizer, vaseline works too.5,4
For an inexpensive makeup remover, I use baby oil to remove my eye makeup,4
It's soft on the skin, it breaks down eyeliner and mascara really easily, and it's cheap,4
You don't have to rub and tug your delicate eye area to get your makeup off.6,4
To make any lipstick matte, I take a two ply tissue paper, separate it and press on sheet onto my lips, taking a translucent powder, I dust it over the sheet and I get instant matte lips.7,4
If I don't have an eyeliner available and I wish to define my eyes, I use an angled eyeliner brush and a mascara to line my eyes,4
I coat the eyeliner brush with mascara and use it to line and define my top lash line,4
(Do not use this on your water line, it will burn and make your eyes water).,4
 I'm going through this right now,4
I confronted one of my friends for being irrational and having a bad attitude,4
We aren't really, really close, but we were once upon a time,4
Well, now she and her friends (who are also my friends) have stopped talking to me, because supposedly, I hurt her ego.Yes, I was hurt and upset in the beginning, but I spoke to my mom and she told me to ignore them back, and to not even look at them when you're passing them on the street or see them anywhere,4
She said they'll automatically starting talking to me in some time, because you aren't affected by their behavior,4
Well, I've been doing that for the past week now, and it seems to be working,4
One of the friends from the group has started talking to me whenever she and I would cross paths.If you think you're right, ignore them and live your life as if it doesn't matter if they're ignoring your or not,4
If you're wrong, apologize once, but if they still have the audacity to ignore you after an apology, you should ignore them too.,4
 I was on my way back to India with a layover in Abu Dhabi,4
There, I met a lady that stayed in Mumbai, a couple of kilometers away,4
She was talking to me and asked me about my health and what I do for a living,4
Suddenly, she whips her son's biodata out and gives it to me,4
She said, "My son's taking positive living classes and I think the both of you would be a good couple." She gave me her number and asked me for mine  I gave her the wrong number,4
She said she'd be in contact and would arrange a meeting for us.I got a marriage proposal at a foreign airport.,4
 My boyfriend, Dhyaan, lives in Zimbabwe,4
I was fortunate to visit the country this year in May,4
I may not be able to give you an actual experience of how the country is and what it's like to live there, but from what I've noticed, during my month-long stay, I hope I'm able to paint a picture that's helpful.My boyfriend lives in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, I've noticed that they have to count each and every penny before spending,4
Dhyaan is a software engineer but works in a steel company as a seller and the head of IT,4
There is no scope for engineers in that city and he's getting paid much less than he really should,4
Their household consists of three earners, his mother, his sister, and him,4
His father wants to work, but because of his health problems, no one is willing to hire him, due to liability issues.Recently, there has been shortage of water, in the neighborhood he stays in,4
They barely get water for two to three hours per day, the same case for electricity,4
They have power only for two hours per day,4
Living in such a warm country, I experienced how difficult it was to function during that time,4
For internet, he has to buy minutes for 3G which gets used pretty quickly.I asked him what it felt like to live in Harare versus when he was here in Mumbai for a month,4
He said that he'd rather live and earn in Mumbai, even if he's earning in rupees, rather than live in Zimbabwe were he's earning in dollars,4
He said that it's terrible living there; they grow most of their own vegetables in fruits in the backyard, but dairy, meats, and grains are something that they have to buy and it becomes difficult when you have to feed a family of four.I know it's not much help, but I hope I was able to provide something worthwhile in this answer.,4
 There are many reasons, but I moved here because I wanted more and better treatment options,4
I've written an answer about that already  Virali Modi's answer to Why would Virali Modi move to India from the US, for medical treatment?.Other than that, I've decided to stay in India because of prospective career in films as an actress and/or model,4
I've realized that I have better chances of landing a project here in India than I do in the US,4
Sure, it's a competitive field anywhere I go, but I feel I have an advantage because I'm from the US  so I can play a role of a foreigner if needed, and I have a good hold on Hindi and Gujarati.Other than that, I like staying in India because I feel more comfortable here,4
I was raised in the US since I was two months old, but I feel more comfortable here than anywhere else,4
It feels like home,4
No doubt, I do complain about the rough and bumpy roads, the politics, and the fact that there is no disabled friendly infrastructure, but I love it and it's home.,4
 When I was young, I wanted to be famous; I didn't care how, but I wanted to be famous,4
There really wasn't a reason for it, except that it seemed really cool! A couple of years later, I was approached by a teacher from Barbizon Modeling and Acting school, and they encouraged me to pursue modeling and acting because I had a unique face,4
I suppose it was just a marketing tactic, but I fell for it,4
I went ahead and paid the fees for the two month course and received lessons on how to apply makeup, style hair, how to behave, and how to pose in front of a camera.Due to the courses, the participants of the course had an opportunity to meet scouts; I met a scout and I got selected for a soda ad,4
I was given a date to sign the contract,4
As you can imagine, I was ecstatic,4
When the day came to sign the contract, I was in the hospital fighting for my life,4
I'm sure everyone knows what happened next,4
I became wheelchair bound and I was paralyzed from the neck down.At that moment, I lost all hope that I'd ever be famous,4
I didn't think I'd do anything worthwhile in my life,4
After a couple of years, I started working on my confidence,4
Gradually, I became so confident that I decided to try my luck in modeling and acting,4
I was shot down by many, many people, until I came across The Miss Wheelchair India beauty pageant.I participated and I won second place,4
From that day on, my life changed,4
People started recognizing me because of the pageant and my writing on Quora,4
I was interviewed for many newspapers(thanks to the PR department at my hospital), and I was even on the news,4
I've had so many articles published on various websites, mainly because of all the media coverage and because of my popularity on Quora.The biggest news yet: I was interviewed for a popular Hindi magazine that's widely circulated throughout America and India called Arogya Sanjeevani,4
I was expecting a column about my life and struggles, rather it turned into a three page spread in the magazine.I never expected to be so popular or 'famous', but it's worked out for me, despite my 'disability',4
I now truly believe that there's so much more for me in the future, and nothing is holding me back.(Source: Arogya Sanjeevani),4
 In my case, I was betrayed by both of my exes,4
It didn't take me a long time to get back into a relationship; rather it took me about three to four months.My first ex cheated on me, on my birthday with his friend whom he treated like a sister,4
My second ex betrayed me by using me for a green card (which he wasn't successful),4
I guess the betrayal from both of them was what made it easier,4
Yes, I was hurt and in denial, but I made myself strong,4
I decided that I deserved much, much better and moved on,4
I started focusing on myself more than anything,4
I did the things I loved and had a passion for,4
I also started making friends around my vicinity and ended up having a good time with them.Gradually, I became normal,4
I was the new and improved me,4
I was someone that I was proud of,4
I learned to love myself even more and became much more confident.,4
 When you become wheelchair bound, you learn to value each and every aspect of life,4
Initially, I couldn't breathe on my own,4
I had a tracheostomy done, which, in a nutshell, is when they pass a device through the vocal box to help someone breathe,4
I couldn't speak, they had to put a small "plug" on to the trache to help me talk, even then my voice was barely audible,4
You learn to appreciate oxygen,4
We really don't think about breathing, but when you have to have a machine to help you breathe, you realize how important it really is.I remember when I was in the ICU that they'd put me on trials for breathing,4
I would pass in and out of consciousness because I felt that I couldn't get enough oxygen, when that really wasn't the case,4
The doctors and nurses, to whom I'm really grateful for, would monitor my oxygen levels, to make sure I was getting enough oxygen,4
At that time, I remember I'd try to call the doctors and nurses to put me back on the machine because it was incredibly strenuous to breathe,4
They couldn't hear me, because I was paralyzed from the neck down and my lungs were incredibly weak, my voice was not audible,4
Gradually, I learned how to breathe without a machine and they removed the trache after a month, which is really painful.Also, during the same time period, I realized I couldn't move my arms or legs,4
I was a vegetable,4
I would try to move my limbs, but I couldn't,4
I would put so much effort into my mobility that it emotionally and mentally drained me,4
Let me tell you something, we don't think about moving our muscles, they just work,4
When you're paralyzed, it's incredibly difficult,4
Try imaging this: You have sleep paralysis, and you're having a nightmare, but you can't move,4
The monster is going to eat you, but you're stuck, immobile,4
You do not realize how difficult it is,4
I don't think anyone can understand or realize that.After getting discharged from the hospital, I couldn't sit by myself without support,4
I couldn't feed myself, I couldn't even use the bathroom because my muscles weren't functioning,4
My mom and dad had to feed me,4
I didn't even have sensation in my stomach,4
I didn't know when I was hungry or when I was full,4
On several instances, I overate,4
I ate so much more than I regularly eat,4
Being a foodie, I can't understand how I didn't know when to eat and when not to eat,4
On one instance, I ate over thirteen roits (basically wheat tortillas),4
My mom kept making them and my dad kept feeding me until he realized that I don't normally eat that much,4
From that point on, my mom made a strict schedule for when I'd eat and when I wouldn't,4
I was on portion control,4
I didn't know if I was starving or if I was full, like I mentioned before,4
I don't think anyone can realize how it feels to not know when you're hungry or when you're not,4
Gradually, I gained that sensation back and I have a normal diet now.Another thing that most people take for granted is the ability to use the restroom,4
I have a catheter, a tube that's inserted into my urethra which connects to my bladder,4
I have to change that tube every fifteen days because I could get a severe infection that could damage my kidneys,4
You do not understand how painful it is,4
Along with that, imagine how embarrassing it is,4
People, if you have a normal functioning bladder, please don't ever take that for granted.In conclusion, please do not take your body parts for granted whatsoever,4
If you're healthy, learn to take care of yourself,4
Go to the gym, work out, get stronger,4
Appreciate what you have and stop worrying about minuscule things,4
Be thankful for what you have and never let a day go without thanking your body for being healthy.,4
 I started dating an Indian-African online almost two years ago.My boyfriend, Dhyaan and I started dating almost two years ago,4
I've done online dating before, but this was different,4
This guy was from Africa, from somewhere that I knew so less of,4
On top of that, it was online,4
Dhyaan could've been anyone he wanted to be and things could've ended badly  very badly.Surprisingly, he and his family are the most supportive, encouraging, caring, passionate, and loving people I have ever known (other than my own),4
Dhyaan taught me about the African culture, things I never thought I'd get to learn and experience; but because of him, I did,4
I traveled to Zimbabwe in May (2015) too see him and crossed off another country on the map.Dhyaan especially has always been so supportive and loving,4
He's supported me in everything and anything that I've ever wanted to do,4
He's helped me with therapy and exercises, he got me motivated to start going to the gym, and he's actually gotten me to eat healthy food (which I'm not a fan of).All I can say is that, I took a big step especially after knowing how horribly my ex-fianc treated me,4
I met my ex online too, but our families knew each other, so it wasn't that weird; yet it all turned out so, so bad,4
Dhyaan and I had no common friends or family at the time, yet things have turned out to be so amazing,4
His family is my family and vice versa for him.,4
 You're only twenty-three years old and you're ready to quit because you don't have friends, a girlfriend, and because you think your life is boring? What will you do when you're really faced with a dilemma? Will you think about giving up and quitting, or will you fight?Let me tell you something, you are alone in this world and that's extremely frightening, but it's the truth,4
You're born alone and you'll die alone,4
It's harsh, I know,4
You know what you should do during this time? You should focus on yourself,4
Focus on why you feel frustrated and depressed,4
Is it because you're feeling the lack of company or is it something else?There are so many ways to resolve your problems that you probably didn't think of,4
Do you think your life is boring? Well, go out and so something adventurous; go sky-diving, go scuba diving, go to an art museum and learn about famous and not so famous artists, focus on your development, go shopping for whatever it is you like, or find something to do that you're passionate about,4
Your 20's are really important, you have the time to learn about yourself, experiences different things, you can take adventures, and guess what  you don't need friends to do that.Having a girlfriend is great, but the chances of finding someone that doesn't understand you, doesn't care for your feelings, and can easily hurt you are high,4
I don't know if you've been in a relationship before or not, but if you don't exactly know what you want from a relationship, things can get difficult and messy,4
You aren't mentally prepared to have someone in your life, according to me,4
Why do I say this? Because you haven't embraced yourself, you haven't embraced the time alone you have with yourself, and you don't seem to love yourself,4
How can you love someone else if you don't love who you are? I'm sorry that was harsh, but for me, I need someone who is comfortable in their own skin, in any situation,4
I need someone who loves who they are,4
That's how I know they'll be able to love me.My mom always told me one thing, "The wrong friends can ruin you." Guess what? It's happened to me,4
My "friends" spread nonsensical rumors about me, which ultimately ruined my reputation,4
I don't wish to explain what happened, that's another answer in its own,4
What I'm trying to say is that most people might not understand you,4
They might take you and your feelings for granted, it might cause you pain,4
Yes, I have friends,4
I hang out with people, but I keep to myself a lot,4
I don't share my feelings with other people, because I cannot expect anyone to understand,4
The only person I can expect something from is myself,4
If you feel alone and if you want someone to understand you, grab a book,4
There are so many books out there, you never know what hidden treasure you'll find in its pages,4
This has always helped me.I'm really sorry if I was harsh, but the lessons I've learned from the people I thought were my own, was a bitter experience,4
I don't think you should have to go through that,4
I genuinely think it's better to be alone than to be around people that don't care.Good luck, OP.,4
 I don't think there's an age limit to anything,4
According to me, you can be sixty years old and party like a college student; at the same time, you can be the same age and study as much as you want to achieve a degree,4
I think society puts the pressure on us to have our lives figured out by the age of thirty, but that's just not possible,4
At thirty, that's when our lives are truly starting,4
We're able to focus on our goals and aspirations, and we can make them reality,4
Life isn't about going to college, getting a degree, getting a job, and earning money,4
I think it's much more than that,4
I think life is about self-realization, understanding who you are and what you truly desire.You often hear about the person who quit their job to travel the world, that's commendable,4
Having that experience of other cultures can help you understand what you truly want and who you truly are,4
These experiences help us shape dreams, they help us understand how blessed we are, and help us understand how much we take for granted.Forgiving ourselves for not accomplishing what we dreamt of is a new concept for me,4
I feel that in life, we go through struggles and hardships to prepare us for what's to come,4
We always end up doing what we're meant to, and the experiences we've had on the way, shape us for what we're truly meant to be,4
Usually, it's always better than what we dreamt of.I'm not sure if I really answered the question, I feel I've ventured off topic here, but I hope I made sense.,4
 You won't believe anything anyone says until you believe in yourself,4
I follow one rule in my life: If I can fix it, I don't have any reason to worry,4
If I can't fix it, why should I worry? Look, I don't know what your problems are, but you need to adapt this way of thinking,4
If you truly know that you can't fix whatever it is that you're getting paranoid over, then stop thinking about it,4
Every bad situation will always have a positive ending,4
Even if you don't believe in that, it's true,4
Whatever you're going through, will have a good outcome for you,4
You really should believe that.I'll give you my example: When I came out of my coma and I realized I was paralyzed from the neck down, I seriously lost all hope,4
I didn't think life could get worse,4
I mean, I didn't have an education, I was a living corpse, I didn't have friends, nor did my immediate family care,4
I kept worrying about my future too.Then my dad told me something, "If you keep worrying ahout something that hasn't happened, how can you focus on what's happening right now? Stop being scared and do what you have to do,4
Don't give a fuck about the future." (Those were his exact words).That's exactly what I did,4
Look where I am now, I'm being featured in newspapers, I was in the news, I did an ad shoot earlier this year, a couple of photo shoots, I perfomed in front of Zayed Khan and Jackky Bhagnani on a wheelchair, I'm Miss Wheelchair India runner up 2014, and I have almost 43k followers on Quora,4
I never expected this! I seriously never did! I always thought I'd do nothing in my life until my dad spoke to me.Life has a way of fucking everything up, teaching you lessons during your struggle, and then making it even better than before,4
You need to forget about the future and live in the present,4
Try making your present better, with that, you'll get a better future.I truly believe that whatever we put out into the world, it comes back to us,4
Try thinking and saying good and positive things, see how this changes your life,4
It's helped me drastically, I'm pretty sure it will help you too.Good luck, OP.,4
 There really isn't just one answer,4
The mixture of products and technique can help to achieve a brighter appearance,4
Products such as illuminators, highlighters, lighter concealers, and setting sprays can help,4
Techniques such as the highlight and strobing effect can also help.Combining the right products for your skin type with the right technique can make you look glowy, healthy, and bright,4
You can also look like a disco ball if you overuse products,4
In achieveing a brighter face, less is always more.Using an illuminating skin cream, under your foundation can make your skin "glow from within",4
Combining that with a light shade of concealer, usually two shades lighter than your foundation, and applying it under your eyes, the bridge of your nose, and your forehead can make you look bright,4
If you really want to enhance that glowy, bright look, you can add a highlighter on top of your cheekbones, your brow bone, your chin, your cupid's bow (the arch of your lip), and the bridge of your nose,4
Like I said earlier, using products in moderation is the key to look "natural",4
Yes, using that much makeup can make you look natural, if you know how to use the products, how they mix with your skin, the right technique for you, and the right appliances for you,4
Makeup is something that you have to play around with until you figure out what works for you.,4
 The disability has nothing to do with it,4
What's important is how you are around people,4
I have friends that are wheelchair bound, whom aren't that good looking (according to me), but have a lively personality and are incredibly confident with who they are,4
They have girlfriends who are able to walk, and got into a relationship after the person was on a wheelchair.Your looks don't matter up to an extent, what matters is your personality, how confident you are, and your ability to get along with the opposite sex,4
Just be yourself, and don't worry about your disability.,4
 The only time I think about my disability is in regards to accessibility in India,4
If I want to go somewhere, I have to make sure the place is wheelchair friendly or there will be someone there to help me (if there are stairs),4
To be honest, my disability doesn't really concern me, I've used it to my advantage,4
Previously, being on a wheelchair gave me low self-esteem,4
I realized that I wasn't someone who had issues with my body or myself,4
I made it a challenge to smile at everyone when going out, and to just be myself,4
Gradually, my confidence increased, and now my disability just doesn't matter.,4
 I received this message on my Facebook page,4
The person who sent this message is a follower on Quora and messaged me to thank me,4
I've received similar messages from people on Quora, Twitter, and Facebook,4
I'm always left in awe when I read that I've helped someone fight depression, help them during a bad phase in their life, stopped them from committing suicide, or if I've just made their day a little bit better.Nothing in the world is more amazing than to know that I've changed, inspired, and/or motivated a life,4
For me, that's the gift of a lifetime,4
I do a happy little dance when I read such messages and I try my best to reply to every one of them,4
To be honest, sometimes I get so ecstatic that I go to tell my mom and I forget to reply all together; it's not something that I'm proud to admit, but it's the truth.Thank you Quora for letting me share my stories, experiences, and advice with the world,4
Thanks to my followers who upvote, comment, share, and message me to let me know that I'm doing a good job,4
When I'm having a bad day, your comments and messages make it so much better.,4
 My family has been through the same thing,4
Exactly the same thing, there were just different variants,4
I empathize with you and your family,4
I know how it feels,4
I can only tell you how we coped with this, and I hope you're able to find some solace in that.When we found out that everyone was being fake towards us, we limited our relationship with them, after getting separated,4
It's difficult, especially if you've lived with your immediate family for so long,4
But here's the thing, we realized that if they didn't care for us, they weren't interested in us, and they had no empathy for us, they didn't belong in our lives,4
We're much more bigger and better than them, we never faked our emotions, we geniunely loved and cared for them,4
If they cannot reciprocate those feelings, why should we care?It's tough, I know, but it's the truth,4
My parents and I are really big on self respect and self worth,4
I know what I deserve and I don't think anyone deserves taunts, hatred, and disrespect,4
If you go back to a place where you're not welcome, where people don't care, disrespect you, you're a fool, especially after knowing that they have zero feelings.I can tell you this: after moving out of that house, my parents have had so much more time for me, so much more time for each other, and more time to focus on the things that were/are important,4
During this time, you need to be strong for your parents and siblings, if you have any,4
You need to tell them that they deserve more than how your family treated you,4
Try mending their wounds with love, affection, and laughter,4
Try paying more attention to making them happy,4
A happy home is a blessed home.,4
 Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange are both private companies,0
Actually, at point of time there were nearly two dozen stock exchanges in India,0
You can have any number of such companies to sell/buy company shares,0
Think of stock exchanges as eBay or your favorite shopping website,0
You can buy the same book published by the same company through multiple shopping websites,0
In the same way, you can buy Infosys stock through multiple stock exchanges,0
Would you rather have just one Flipkart or have competition from multiple shopping websites so that the commission charged by the website is low?BSE is the older company dating back to 1875 and by 1992 the government found that it was slacking,0
BSE had no competition back then and its brokers were a closed group of merchants,0
There was very little technology, transparency or openness,0
That was not good for country that was just opening up.Thus, in 1992 Narasimha Rao prodded a bunch of government companies such as LIC, IDBI and SBI to create a new stock exchange company with the best of technology available and a much more open system of admitting brokers,0
Anyone with expertise could become a broker in this new company and not just some nephew of a powerful Dalal street merchant,0
This new exchange also provide better data on the prices and thus it became quite easy for ordinary traders to enter the stock markets,0

 It is just unfortunate and a game of politics,0
It can also be counterproductive as the left wing academia might be playing all its cards too early,0
That group is going all-in and staking all its credibility on an issue in which the central government has very little role to play,0
And most importantly, it is the nation that provides them the award,0
I feel they are insulting the nation for very little fault of them,0
For the first time since independence, the left wing academia has very little hold over the government and its only playing hand is when Modi is visiting abroad - especially the US and UK,0
The protests thus started to time with Modi's visit to the US and is peaking just before Modi's visit to the UK,0
Such protests gets attention of media in US & UK, and bad publicity for India at a crucial diplomatic visit could make the Indian government listen to them.Match a group that feels ignored and a government that puts marketing at the top of its game, and you get such weird protests,0
The accusation is not even one of government committing a crime or a scandal or even being negligent, but a government doesn't condemn publicly every crime that happens in India,0
This can tarnish some of India's reputation,0
Was India a more tolerant place in the past when schools were vandalized and professors attacked, maimed for remotely "insulting" a religion? How was the academia able to hold its conscience all this long when we have past so much bloodshed from every religious group [How do Indians feel about the many massacres that Indians have committed?]? If we stop our hypocrisy there will be a better fight against actual intolerance,0
If not, the award returning will have no impact on India,0
In the domestic politics, the award returning is actually counterproductive,0
The extremists in the right wing want to portray the academia as clueless marxists and by returning the academia is falling right into the trap,0
You can already hear some right wingers gloating,0
What this also does is it weakens the moderates within the right wing who want to respect those academics no matter what political opinion they have,0
On the whole, it might not have that much impact on India,0
None of the artists who returned those awards have any bit of following in the general public,0
General public has little recognition of the names of those returning the awards and some even accuse those who return as attention seekers [intelligent artists who are long past their prime].Most importantly, the actions just tarnish the name of the nation,0
If you have a beef with the BJP or Modi, go and fight them, but don't belittle your nation as none of the awards were given by the present government,0
I have very little respect for anyone who takes domestic politics to tarnish India's image abroad,0
Even if they were returning the awards to protest the Congress government, I would hate them for the same,0
Because, they are insulting the nation for the perceived faults of a political party.,0
 The people who keep overemphasizing the victory of the Labour government in 1945, don't often understand the sequence of steps that led up to India's independence,0
Labour election sure was important, but it just hastened the process by a couple of years,0
In May 1945, Lord Wavell [then the Viceroy of India] presented a detailed plan to the Indians for divesting the power,0
In the plan - Simla Conference - Indians would get full control of everything other than defense and foreign policy,0
In the government, only the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief would be British and the rest would be Indians,0
And this was done when Churchill was still in power,0
This was again a big move from the Government of India Act 1935, when Indians were allowed to elect their own governments, although their powers would be limited,0
Indians still didn't accept Wavell's plan as they wanted nothing but independence,0
By 1945, it already appeared to the British that India could not be ruled without the consent of Indians,0
Congress made it very expensive to conduct a government and various economic blockades by Gandhi made India not very profitable colony,0
The end of war also meant that the Indian soldiers and workers were not needed in as big numbers,0
Had the British tried to continue past 1947, there would have been chaos for which British government was not prepared for,0
As the old saying goes, British Indian government would drown in flood if the 400 million Indians were to just spit,0
By 1947, Indians were prepared for that and from that point it was impossible to govern,0
The best that was hoped was a respectful exit and continuation of economic ties.,0
 Only a small fraction of the Indian Muslims belonged to the ruling class,0
Among that ruling class, a sizable chunk [such as the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Nawab of Junagadh and many Zamindars in Awadh & elsewhere] migrated to Pakistan after the partition,0
A large section of Indian Muslims come from the lower segments of the Hindu society and thus face the same problems of their peers in the Hindu community,0
Instead of comparing Hindus v,0
Muslims as a whole, a better comparison would be comparing two people from the same locality/caste/class background, but only differ by religion,0
Besides the caste composition, there a several key factors:Geography: A large chunk of Indian Muslims live in poorer and often landlocked states,0
Muslim concentration is the highest in J&K, Assam, UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala,0
Other than Kerala, all the other states have low incomes,0
In prosperous states such as Punjab, Delhi, Haryana, Goa, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra Muslim population is quite less,0
Page on prsindia.orgColonialism: While colonialism hit all of India, Muslims were slightly more impacted due to their occupation and geography,0
A lot of them were artisans working in cities like Lucknow and Varanasi,0
They were now out of job through industrial revolution,0
In the new metropolises of the colonial era - Bombay, Calcutta and Madras - Muslim population was traditionally low,0
Unlike the upper caste Hindus, they were not able to switch to the new economy when British Raj changed everything around,0
Rights of Muslim women: While Nehru pushed through major reforms in Hindu civil law, he was too cautious in doing the same to Muslim women,0
These laws on divorce, marriage and inheritance helped Hindu women grow better than their Muslim peers,0
In 1980s, Rajiv Gandhi's government went against even a basic grant of alimony to a Muslim woman in Shah Bano case,0
Again, it is all relative - we are just talking about say 5-10% difference in incomes and education,0
Hindu women too continue to face enormous challenges, but are slightly better placed than Muslim women,0
A community cannot develop without its women,0
Modernizing education system: As much as 10% of Muslim children study in Madrasas,0
Modernity And The Madrasa,0
These degrees are not recognized and don't prepare the students for the modern economy,0
Far less percentage of Hindus graduate from religious schools,0
Government has to look to get a sizable portion of them into the formal schooling,0
I have written another answer on the same topic: What are the reasons behind Indian Muslims' backwardness (educational, social, political, economic)?,0
 Among the popular Tamil actors, many are/were light skinned - MGR, Kamal Hassan, Ajith to name a few,0
There were also a few dark skinned popular actresses such as Savithri,0
Only in the past two decades it seems to have shifted a lot into the lighter skinned actresses.While Tamils like many Indians prefer their icons light skinned, the male actors can get away with being dark if they can provide a powerful acting experience,0
Rajinikanth is dark skinned, but he has plenty of other positives to carry him through to the audience,0
The male actors have to be relatable and thus south Indian boys usually have a major advantage,0
On the other hand, female actors have no way to show their positives in acting qualities as their roles have become quite limited,0
Unlike even two decades ago, most of the actresses are brought from the north and the language is no big deal as they are not expected much anyway,0
They are made to play like dolls and in such a game the hottest light skinned girl wins regardless of how shabby the acting is,0
Since they have no character requirement to be relatable, homegrown girls don't have much advantage.,0
 By sheer coincidence or impeccable timing, both of India's nuclear tests came at a time when a US President was on the verge of getting impeached,0
A President getting impeached is a very rare event and it puts the whole administration in disarray, unable to focus on the world,0
When a US President is distracted, words of rest of Western allies have no biting power.In 1974, India tested one device and didn't openly state it as a weapon,0
It called it a peaceful explosion,0
To prove the point, India conducted the tests on Buddha Jayanthi - the birthday of Buddha,0
The ambiguity and geopolitical factors of that time probably saved India from sanctions although it later impacted India's technological cooperation with the rest of the world,0
In 1998, India tested 5 advanced weapons and dropped the charade to declare itself a nuclear power,0
It again tested the bombs on Buddha's birthday but probably with a wink this time,0
There was also the politics,0
In 1998, the bombs were exploded when the right wing BJP was newly in power and US had a lot of uncertainty about the party,0
They didn't understand BJP as much as they understood Congress and this brought a quick reaction in the form of snctions,0
There was mutual hatred between the BJP and US government for a long time, until things were mended quite soon after the explosion.The ImpeachmentsIn 1974 (first test), Nixon was very close to being impeached [he eventually resigned before the impeachment] and his Vice President was gone on corruption charges,0
This left the secretary of state Henry Kissinger to run a headless show in Washington,0
Kissinger had also softened his stance on India since the 1971 war to liberate Bangladesh, in which US fought on the other side of India,0
This meant that US reaction was very muted,0
In 1998 (second test), Clinton was getting impeached few months down the road [later acquitted by the Senate],0
He was battling a huge storm inside regarding his sexual affairs,0
That said, things were not as dire as in 1974 as the rest of the administration was not impacted as much,0
This left the President to impose sanctions quickly although some critics thought it was still somewhat soft.Another coincidence was that things moved pretty fast in the world of that time that there was hardly anytime to think about it,0
1974 tests followed the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, where Pakistan was split into two and the tests were followed by huge domestic disturbance in India [Emergency],0
There was massive inflation and oil crises world over too,0
It all put the nuclear question in lower priority in both the countries.In case of 1998, again there was the coincidence of a war with Pakistan that now followed the tests in 1999,0
Then a massive election scandal occurred in 2000 and a few months later September 11 changed the whole world for the US,0
Again, there were way many things moving around to focus on the nuclear question.,0
 As others mentioned Modi has a Masters in Political Science and thus he is sure to have read Ambedkar's works,0
It might seem ironic and counterintuitive to some, but the sangh parivar seems to be genuinely taking into many of Ambedkar's teachings - including fighting caste,0
The reason is that castes & caste leaders stand in the way of RSS' consolidation of the Hindu base,0
And no group stands to gain from caste weakening as much as the RSS,0
Here is a fascinating article in The Hindu on this: Hindutva 2.0s new caste challenge,0
This significant pivot in the last decade is one key element in the resurgence of BJP,0
The pivot firmly rests on bringing minority caste in each state to power and weaken the grip of the majority castes,0
Thus, RSS put weight behind Modi in 2001 to weaken Patel control in Gujarat and later put weight behind Nitish Kumar [again from a minority caste] to weaken the Yadav base in Bihar,0
In UP they sacrificed some of their Brahmin votes to Mayawati to focus on the Dalits,0
In Rajasthan, they brought a non-Jat [Vasundra Raje] and in Maharashtra they brought a non-Maratha [Fadnavis] after a long time,0
When the Patels revolt or Shiv Sena goes berserk it is because RSS' pivot seems to be working way too well for them,0
RSS Wants No Bar for CastesIf you thought Modi had a thumping win merely because of his economic ideas or his social media activities, you are mistaken,0
There is something big going underneath.Ambedkar would not have approved RSS' methods nor does RSS accept all of Ambedkar's ideas, but there seems to be a genuine recognition of Ambedkarism in the right wing, even if only in parts,0
They might add him to their pantheon of outside heroes alongside Patel and Bose,0
For Modi and the Sangh, weakening the castes works well for their power interests because weakening castes also means weakening of many of their key opponents [caste leaders].,0
 In many cases it was threat of outright power and war,0
The most dramatic of this is the Indian integration of Hyderabad,0
That kingdom was as big as the whole of UK and Patel's troops annexed it under 5 days with a loss of just 32 men,0
They called it a "Police Action" to avoid getting attention in the international community It was among the most efficient military operations in history although the whole period before and after the operation was marred with massive atrocities against both Hindus and Muslims.The swift operation by Patel's men and excellent diplomacy by Nehru's meant that UN Security Council could not do much despite all of Hyderabad's and Pakistan's pleading,0
Patel also silently let the Communists weaken the Nizam's forces through massive peasant agitations in the months leading up to the annexation,0
In case of Junagadh that makes a sizable chunk of present Gujarat, India sort of waited until the opponent made a mistake and made full use of it,0
The nawab had already left the state and its new head Shah Nawaz Bhutto [grandfather of Benazir Bhutto and father of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto] made the mistake of annexing a couple of smaller rulers who had already conveyed an intention to join India,0
This act was use as a pretext to attack and again very swiftly bring the state into India,0
A plebiscite was later held to confirm the verdict,0
Indian integration of JunagadhIn case of Travancore [most of present Kerala] the king thought he had ports and economy to stake on his own Hindu kingdom,0
Once again the Communists helped Patel's cause,0
A massive peasant unrest and an assassination attempt on the diwan C,0
P,0
Ramaswami Iyer [likely Patel had nothing to do with this] brought the king crawling to join India,0
An excellent book on this is the THE STORY OF THE INTEGRATION OF THE INDIAN STATES by the VP Menon [the person who did the job for Patel],0
 Apart from Mahatma Gandhi and Morarji Desai that Nagarajan Srinivas has already mentioned, there is Sardar Patel, C,0
Rajagopalachari, Netaji Bose, Vivekananda, the historian R,0
C,0
Majumdar who are respected by people of all political inclinations,0
A sizable body of the Constituent Assembly who wrote our Constitution were from the right wing,0
Again, some of these were right wing on religion only (Bose) and some were right on both religion & economics (Rajaji and Patel),0
In the present day again we have one group that is primarily right on religion, but left on economics (the Sangh parivar & a lot of BJP), one group that is right on economics, but not as much on religion (the Swarajya group, the economists Jagdish Bhagwati, Aravinda Panagariya, Gurucharan Das & Ashok Desai) and the rest who are right on both aspects (one faction of BJP such as Arun Shourie),0
Traditionally, across the world right wing is short in academia,0
As the old saying goes, the left wingers with brains become professors and the right wingers with brains become entrepreneurs,0
The right wing is thus still short of more intellectuals, but the tide seems to be turning.,0
 India has seen ups and downs throughout its long history stretching beyond 5000 years,0
For thousands of years, India has had a common culture no matter which empire ruled and which empire fell,0
Mauryas, Satvahanas, Kushans, Guptas, Palas, Mughals, Marathas, the British Raj and finally Sardar Patel kept rebuilding the pieces after everything fell apart,0
Lots of people with a limited knowledge of India predicted that the nation would fall apart easily,0
They have very little clue of the very strong binding forces that underpin India,0
In 1940s, many historians thought the union would not last,0
As late as 1991, New York Times penned editorials about the impending collapse of India,0
Why India's Unity MattersPity India..,0
Indian disunion would be a calamity for human rights..,0
History suggests a terrible cost if India dissolves,0
India didn't dissolve,0
Instead, it has become a major force to reckon whether it is in economy, tech or military,0
We have seen extraordinary levels of violence in the past and the 1980s-90s were a severe test,0
We passed,0
For decades, media painted a bleak picture that the rise of the Hindu right would break India,0
It didn't,0
India continues to have very low crime rates in the world,0
Nothing today is worse than what it was 3 decades ago,0
The past two centuries have been down times for India and such down times have occurred for every civilization in history,0
In the 21st, we will get back to our groove.How did India remain united as one country after 1947, given its huge cultural diversity and religious differences?,0
 In 1947, when India was partitioned there was a lot of pain and confusion,0
Millions were uprooted and hundreds of thousands died,0
It was the biggest human tragedy in Indian history,0
Confused and angry, many mistakenly blamed all this on the Mahatma as he was the biggest target they could find,0
They thought he had the power to stop the partition [he didn't] and he had the power to stop the violence [he did stop a vast chunk of it in the east].For many on the Hindu right, Mahatma was seen as soft towards Muslims,0
They could not see his vision and his message of peace was seen as compromising,0
The biggest issue was the India's west [Punjab to Gujarat] was exploding and no one really anticipated,0
Indian leadership prepared for the worst in Bengal and sent Gandhi to put out the fires,0
And there was nothing really done to put out the fires in Punjab,0
They had no real plans and were stunned by the sheer scale of violence,0
Hindu right was extremely angry on the western side that Gandhi didn't come to save him,0
Ironically, if he were not assassinated, he would have proceeded to Punjab to control the violence there,0
And Mahatma did plan to go to Punjab even earlier [Sept 1947] but was retained in Delhi by Sardar Patel as the situation in the capital was even more dire.Many of Gandhi's peace objectives were also twisted,0
The sad thing was the rumor mill was the key factor,0
55 crores to Pakistan: This was the much talked about thing of that day,0
Indian government over Pakistan Rs,0
75 crores from splitting the treasury and gave an initial Rs,0
20 crores,0
By the time it could give the remaining, the war in Kashmir begun,0
Some in the government want to block the money,0
Others wanted to pay,0
Although Mahatma Gandhi wanted the Indian government to pay what it owed, some twisted this as portraying the Mahatma having his major fast to arm twist the government to pay this money,0
That is absurd - why would he fast just for paying some amount of money? But, many don't question that,0
At the end of the day, the extremists some of whom didn't really oppose the partition wanted the Mahatma [the most vociferous opponent of the partition] to act as just a partisan Hindu instead of an Indian,0
They saw his overtures to bring all communities together as a threat,0
They mistakenly believed that the Mahatma was the source of this violence & believed he caused the partition and he fasted to pay the 55 crores to Pakistan.,0
 It is an outdated theory that refuses to die,0
The idea is that there was a huge lost continent south of Tamil Nadu,0
While many civilizations believe in such submerged islands [Atlantis], the sheer size & imagination of Lemuria is massive,0
If it were a country it would probably be the second largest,0
When I was a school kid I too fantasized about that after being misinformed by some of my school teachers,0
The idea was invented in the 1860s when an English zoologist noted that there were these monkeys called Lemur that were found in Madagascar, India and some parts of South East Asia,0
Thus, he had an hypothesis that a landmass connected all the three,0
Later as we begun understanding geography and human evolution better this theory became untenable,0
While the scientists abandoned this theory, a fringe group of Indian/Tamil supremacists took hold of that theory,0
Around the turn of the 20th century, there was a huge interest in race, migration and nationalism,0
Some Indians thought that the superior blooded Aryans came from the North pole while a few others thought the Dravidians came from this lost continent,0
Both sides wanted to boost their egos at a time when the wave of nationalism and identity seeking at its heaviest,0
There surely was a massive landmass under Indian Ocean, but that was between 2 billion - 85 million years ago,0
Far before mammals, leave alone humans,0
Fragments of ancient continent buried under Indian OceanWhile I believe that there were such massive landmasses well before human history and there were possibly many cities submerged near TN coast line, it is crazy to believe in a huge continent that supported the ancient Tamil civilization.,0
 A lot of us naively believe that we can build our new cities without taking any bit of agricultural or forest land,0
The fact is that there is hardly any good land left in India that somebody is not already using for something,0
40,000 acres is about 161 sq km,0
That is barely enough for a major city,0
London and New Delhi are about 10 times bigger than that,0
If things go by plan, up to a quarter of Andhra's 5 crore people will live in this major metropolis extending from Guntur to Vijayawada,0
How do you accommodate that big a population with all their apartments, schools, roads and hospitals?Maybe AP could build its capital in western Rayalseema districts without a lot of fields,0
If you build the capital in say Anantapur district, where would you get the water to support crores of future residents to this new capital city? The district is bone dry as it is,0
You need a massive water source to support a crore people,0
Historically, great cities have always been built next to rivers or other great water sources,0
In case of AP, this would have to be Krishna or Godavari,0
The problem is that every bit of land next to these rivers is fertile & used for agriculture,0
There is no way to build a great city without taking agricultural lands and that was true of most of the great cities in the world - whether it is Delhi or London or New York,0
Andhra Pradesh has an area of 3,95,87,200 acres of which farm lands are nearly nearly two-thirds,0
It is not running out of farm lands any time soon,0
Far less than 1% of this farmland is taken away for the capital and all other infrastructure projects,0
If there is an agricultural crisis it is not due to a shortage of land, but due to mismanagement of water, poor access to technology and lower productivity of the fields,0
India could potentially double the farm productivity enabling it to cut the arable land by as much as a half in the future.,0
 It surely is a major crime and how dare they do it in a secular country,0
We should ban such a heinous practice of chanting Aum near the tomb of Mahatma Gandhi,0
Next up, the government should ban the use of decimal number system as these ten digits have been devised by some Hindus in the past,0
Hindu numeral system,0
Such a blatant use of Hindu cultural symbols in a secular nation would hurt the sentiments of so many,0
To avoid the risk of India becoming a Hindu nation, the government should be made to use only Roman numerals everywhere,0
MMMMDCXXXVII crores this year should be earmarked for reprinting government documents,0
OMG can I use crores here without hurting anyone's sentiment? Because it is from Koti that is used in many Hindu scriptures,0
After that we should picket the homes of Viswanathan Anand, Koneru Humpy and other Chess grandmasters,0
How dare they publicly play a game devised by the Hindu monarchs,0
Such a casteist, racist, non-secular game where the white plays first must be banned,0
That is blatantly varna system and these upper caste slave owners are hurting the sentiments of millions,0
Balaji Viswanathan's answer to Is it racist that white makes the first move in a game of chess? After this, we will go after the school kids learning trignometry,0
The first use of sine and cosine tables come from ryabhaa's sine table and using such trigonometric tables in a blatant way from a Hindu would hurt the sentiments of so many,0
Next we will go after Diamonds,0
Those shiny rocks that some Hindu folks first discovered are playing havoc when it comes to buying rings,0
These stones long used as religious icons is non-secular,0
We will ban the entire diamond industry [double bonus, it is centered in Modi's state] and anyone wearing diamonds will be labeled as Modi bhakt,0
Finally, all Indian dance forms, music forms, drama arts should be banned near all government offices, because they all have their roots in religion,0
We should also take our lion emblem out, the national motto [Satyameva Jayate] and even the national flag because they all have religious symbols underneath.Secularism means a saint like Sankaracharya would not be passing laws in the Parliament, you will not be barred from becoming the head of the country merely because you are from religion X and the court would not punish you merely for not following a principle from Gita,0
But, it doesn't mean every element of Indian culture be removed from the public,0
Secularism primarily had its roots in Europe, where the Church historically had an outsized role,0
Indian religions don't have such a central church nor a powerful Pope and thus our Constitution was not written with the problems & paranoia of Europe in mind,0
Indian version of secularism is about tolerance and acceptance of all faiths like we always did through history, not a fanatic removal of cultural/historic symbols from public life,0
Should an Egyptian be forced to defend their great pyramids? Is a Greek expected to avoid talking about Herodotus or Alexander or any Greek symbol because of a possible (later) connotation with the crusades? Why is an Indian expected to avoid ancient Indian symbols and culture just because some outsider put a "religion" tag over this?Is the "Om" specific to only "Hinduism" or is it spread across a variety of Indian cultures? Where does Indian culture end and "Hindu" religion begin? How do you plan to whitewash Hindu religious elements without whitewashing Indian culture too? Once you whitewash this culture on what does the nation rest upon?,0
 If you include income, literacy, infrastructure, sanitation, gender rights as the primary factors North East scores better Odisha,0
Odisha's interior districts often drag down the state's overall indicators.Percapita income,0
Worldwide, this is considered one of the key factors in deciding if a region is developed or not,0
Other than Assam, all NE states have incomes higher than Odisha,0
Page on pbplanning.gov.in This is the same result for life expectancy at birth, unemployment, school enrollment and riots rate,0
In each case only Assam stands out in NE, while rest perform better than Odisha.Human Development,0
HDI is an index that measures a variety of things including literacy, income, and life expectancy,0
All NE states perform higher than Odisha,0

Indian states and territories ranked by povertyCrimes against women: If you rank Indian states by violence against women, NE states have far fewer crimes against women than Odisha,0
Interestingly, Kerala seems to have the most crimes against women,0
Indian states and territories ranked by safety of womenThe same results for these other indicators too,0
NE states perform better than most of India, not just Odisha,0
Electricity coverage: households having electricityToilet availability:  availability of toiletsHIV awareness: HIV awarenessThat said, Odisha is better than the Northeast in a couple of indicators: drinking water, suicide and Child Nutrition,0
However, the overall winners are the states in the North East.,0
 One thing I want to add to Luke's good answer is that it also depends on which class & locality you are born in,0
If you are going to be born as a poor villager, then India is likely worse than Vietnam, Iran and China,0
India's healthcare, sanitation and primary education is terrible if you are poor.If you are going to be born in a rich, urban family India is the best place to be in,0
Ultra rich often face trouble from the party in China and face slightly more security issues in Vietnam,0
A rich Indian can have an outsized power in the society, have access to great education & healthcare and can also greatly utilize India's fast growing economy,0
Politicians, media, army and the civil society will not come in the way of a rich person,0
If you are going to be in the urban middle class, it is a tie between China and India,0
Middle class Chinese have a variety of advantages - such as far better roads, airports, trains & uninterrupted power, while a middle class Indian has better political power, the benefit of English & better relations with the west to travel the world more,0
A simple example is that, for an Indian it is fairly easy to get a 10 year multiple entry visitor visa in US, while until recently Chinese were limited to 6 months at a time [due to reciprocal arrangements],0
Middle class Indians and Chinese are thus roughly comparable in the range of benefits they can get from the society.Edit: There seems to be some confusion in the comment thread on what Middle Class means,0
Middle Class in Indian standards refers to about $600/month [10 times less than in the west] and that translates to about Rs,0
40,000/month,0
Only a small fraction of India is in middle or upper middle,0
Everyone in India thinks they are 'middle class' and almost no one actually is,0
 It is not easy to build a new capital on top of an old city,0
To create the modern roads and other infrastructure, you need to demolish a lot of existing buildings in that city & it is both expensive and time consuming,0
There will be a number of court cases and it is a headache,0
It is better to build a city from scratch, like New Delhi and Chandigarh,0
That way you have the new city that will be in addition to other cities, nor be a mere replacement,0
Just as New Delhi subsumed old Delhi, Amaravati would subsume Guntur and Vijayawada - this way providing a taste of the old culture and the modernity of the new city,0
Amaravati is also a great name as it connects the state to its glorious past.,0
 Gupta empire is the longest of major Indian empires extending for nearly three centuries,0
Mauryan empire lasted about 150 years; Mughal and British Raj each lasted slightly less than 200 years each,0
It had among the strongest of militaries and most efficient of administration among any Indian empire.It is in Gupta dynasty in which India had some of its greatest achievements,0
From chess to sex (kamasutra), from zero to Shakuntala, from Panchatantra to ayurvedha, the key elements that defined Indian history were made then,0
Aryabhatta developed 0 and the number system in this period,0
Varahamihira built the greatest works on Indian astronomy,0
Kamasutra was written by Vatsayana, Kalidasa brought the greatest of Indian drama that impacts Indian art to this day while Vishnu Sharma's Panchatantra stories entertain Indian kids to this day,0
In visual arts, we see stunning elements of Gupta art in UNESCO world heritage sites such as the Ajanta & Ellora caves [part of the caves were developed in Satvahana period though],0
Sushruta brought some of the greatest medicinal works for his period,0
It was under the Gupta, Indian education went to great heights with the establishment of the Nalanda University among others,0
It is fascinating to see that even after 1500 years their works are as good as new to us,0
We are continued to be fascinated by Shakuntala, Chess, zero, Panchatantra and Kamasutra,0
And Nalanda stands as a great inspiration for what can achieve.Literature, mathematics, physics, painting, medicine and religion were all in their glorious heights, while there was social stability, peace and economic prosperity,0
It is easily the golden age,0
If I had a time machine, 400 AD Ujjain would be my destination followed by 1000 AD Thanjavur [Chola Empire].,0
 Actually, Fortune 500 CEOs are more likely to have engineering background than anything else,0
Nearly a third of them did engineering in their undergrad,0
That said the functional role that led to the CEO path is quite diverse,0
Finance leads it at 15% of CEOs coming through that role,0
33% Of CEOs Majored In Engineering Of the 100 best CEOs 29 have MBA degree, 24 have engineering degree and 8 have both,0
The Best-Performing CEOs in the WorldA few other interesting statistics from: The Path To Becoming A Fortune 500 CEO75% of the CEOs come from operating related roles [such as COO] 30% of the CEOs took time early in their careers to build a strong finance foundation.Only 33% of the CEOs spent all their career in that company,0
Rest moved around,0
Average age for a CEO at the time of appointment is 50 and the average time spent in that company is 16.Nearly half of the CEOs spent time as a non-executive director in their company.Engineers are preferred choice for CEOs,0
 The biggest feature that will make or break India is its demographic,0
We have the world's largest population of youth by a huge margin,0
We have 356 million people in the age group 10-24 years old,0
That is more youth than US and China combined,0
India has worlds largest youth population: UN reportThis means we have a population that can potentially jump to the newest technologies and ideas without the burden of past baggage just as easily as Indians took Quora,0
We could quickly climb up the economic ladder by skipping past the past,0
Politics can move quite quickly the elections of Modi and Kejriwal showed,0
On the flip side, we have a huge population for which we don't generate enough jobs or have enough skill development avenues,0
Unemployment, crime and social unrest can happen if the expectations are not matched,0
The second feature is the arable land,0
India has almost as much arable land as United States - world's leader in that measure,0
With 162 million hectares of fertile land, India has more agricultural land than even China with more than thrice its area,0
This was the key feature that helped India throughout history,0
However, as we need land to build homes, factories and roads, we would have to take a chunk of this arable land,0
We cannot eliminate poverty without building people homes and jobs,0
This means India's success or failure will depend on how much of the agricultural land it can take away for other uses & make sure these are utilized well.,0
 In case of the first wave of English colonies (16th-18th centuries), the people from England settled in those colonies,0
Not just some men toting guns, but whole families - men, women and kids who made their voyage on Mayflower and countless other ships,0
Due to a variety of religious revolutions and civil war, many common English folk took these ships as a way out,0
In contrast, in other European countries there was not as much pain in that period to move whole families out,0
French, Dutch, Germans and Italians just stayed put at home,0
Only a few young men were sent and they would return after their mission,0
No major families or settlements abroad,0
Spanish and Portuguese settled more than the French and Dutch, but still were not moving as much as the English,0
[South Africa was one exception for the Dutch,0
There they Dutch stayed in large numbers & had a prosperous nation that was at the same time the worst for the natives.]In that wave of English colonies - US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - the locals were mostly driven out to remote settlements and the English immigrants totally took over the land,0
They brought their ideas and technology and built their homes,0
Since they were settling permanently they were more vested in ensuring rights, liberty etc,0
Other colonial settlers were not settling for good and out there to make a fast buck out of the resources and markets,0
Thus, they never setup as good infrastructure - social and physical,0
They also didn't bring the best of their technology,0
At the same time, other colonial powers didn't always wipe the native cultures as much as the English did at that time,0
From the late 18th century onwards the situation flipped,0
It was now the English who were done with the civil wars & revolutions and the rest of Europe picking up the chaos,0
Englishmen stopped settling outside in droves and in the second wave of colonization - India, Malaysia, Kenya, Egypt - they did like what other colonial powers did,0
They sent their young men to war, to trade and to rule, but they didn't send their families to settle,0
This meant that the native cultures were not exterminated, but at the same time the colonial masters had little incentive to think in the colony's main interests - as they were not settling there anyway,0
It was at this time that a lot of Germans, Italians, Irish and other Europeans took the boats to escape the chaos,0
They settled in large numbers in the US and elsewhere,0
However, by then England and other powers had already setup their culture,0
Thus, even when Germans rivalled the English in numbers in North America, US & Canada never turned German, but remained British,0
Britain's colonies ended in two extremities,0
On one end you have prosperous ones like US & Australia and on other end you have Myanmar, Zimbabwe, Sudan, etc,0
The difference is how many English tried to make the colony as their home vs see it merely as a land for exploitation,0
South Africa fall somewhere inbetween,0
At the end of the day, colonization provided two choices - lose all native civilization & culture or lose all of economic power & prosperity,0
All colonies lost at least one of the two,0
If the Native Americans & Aborigines lost their civilization & homelands, Indians & Egyptians lost their economic prosperity.,0
 Asian is a term too broad and is an outdated, Euro-centric way of looking at the world,0
Every civilization had an equivalent of "others" - people who were outside the civilization and Asia is just one such term [people who were not in Greek world of Europa],0
It makes no sense to put Japan and Syria in the same bucket as there is very little connection between the two - no common history, language, race, religion etc,0
This map is a slightly better grouping of the world,0
It does a good job in most places,0
However, this too suffers by grouping Africa as a monolithic unit.Here is an even better map used by UN's food & agricultural organization.There is a glaring issue of grouping Iraq with South-Central Asia and not including Japan in East Asia, but overall the above is the most accurate I have found,0
Such grouping can help you understand world issues better.,0
 There are two episodes in the Bangladeshi Liberation War,0
The one between March 1971 [when Mujibur was arrested] and end of November 1971 was the civil war,0
India while supporting Mukti Bahini and other rebel movements, was not officially a part of it.The two weeks between December 3 and 16 of that year was the Indo-Pakistan war,0
Indo-Pakistani War of 1971,0
Pakistan started it by sending a bunch of jets to attack India and India hit back,0
Both countries involved their navy, airforce and army,0
India captured territory and armed forces,0
And the war was not just in Bengal, but all over South Asia,0
India even had to cover up Taj Mahal as Pakistan jets tried to hit Agra,0
It was the only time India lost a warship as INS Khukri (F149) was sunk with 176 sailors,0
India has done such sacrifices during that war and taking India's name out of that war is sheer insensitive for any Bangladeshi,0
In short, there was a Bangladeshi civil war for the most part of 1971 and then a direct Indo-Pakistan war at the end of it,0
Both are important and related, but different,0
,0
 When I went to buy my first car, the dealer gave me a 0% loan for 6 years,0
That ensured that he got my business that day [selling the car] and for a few years to come [maintenance, supplies] and even the potential to sell the next car a few years down the road,0
Seller financing is a prominent business strategy where the seller closes the deal by offering sweet financing,0
A lot of major businesses do that,0
And so do many countries,0
Japan does that, China does that and so does India on a smaller scale [prompting questions like why India provides aid to Nepal etc].In India, Japan and China are fighting to dominate the world's hottest rail market,0
China was leading in the game of finishing India's first bullet train that will get a lot of publicity and copycat projects,0
However, China didn't finance the deal,0
Japan entered the market with a easy financing deal and pocketed the deal,0
In this, it was not really different from my car dealer who gave a 0% loan to me to pocket business from a rival.To build the bullet train, you need a lot of things,0
Some of them will be made in India and the rest will be made in Japan,0
In the contract, Japan has said that 30% of the things has to be bought from Japan,0
There will be a large number of exports from Japan to build the bullet train,0
That is a lot of jobs,0
Once the line is built, there will be maintenance and adding new train carriages,0
More exports and more jobs.The Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train is just a starting point,0
If this works, India will be building advanced trains all over the country,0
And trains are just one among dozens of new things India will make - new homes, new cities, new factories,0
Trillions of dollars are at stake here,0
Like a Venture Capitalist, Japan is trying to enter the market early and capture it before others come in,0
At the end of the day, it is business,0
Just as your shopkeeper provides you cheap loans to buy TV, phones and other appliances, countries provide you loans to buy their technology and products,0
Do you think the Audi dealer below is providing you charity by providing a 0% loan? No,0
Neither does Japan.,0
 A big factor is the Kissinger's diplomacy in the region that time,0
In their massive geopolitical game with USSR, US was blinded on its own key principles - killing democracy in Iran and Afghanistan, helping the French fight freedom fighters in Vietnam and helping Pakistan unleash a major genocide (1971 Bangladesh genocide),0
In the process of helping Pakistan during that genocide, Nixon made India very insecure, forcing it to go nuclear,0
While India was always interested in going nuclear, the key event that tipped the balance was the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war,0
In that war, India was able to split Pakistan into two - create the new nation of Bangladesh,0
But, it was also a war that made India nervous because a number of big nations was on the side of Pakistan,0
US, UK, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia all threw their weight behind Pakistan,0
Sri Lanka provided logistical support and China helped slightly with weapons,0
The US 7th fleet was closing in on Bay of Bengal [US forces had orders to target Indian Army in 1971] and the danger of US fighting India directly was only avoided by the massive presence of Russian ships blocking off that route - 1971 War: How Russia sank Nixons gunboat diplomacy,0
China too luckily didn't bite Kissinger's tasty treat of attacking India on all 4 directions.After the war was won, Indians never forgot how close they got to being surrounded by world's superpowers for the mere fault of trying to stop a major genocide in what is now Bangladesh,0
India understood the importance of nuclear deterrence and also the value of military power,0
Nine months after the war, Indian Prime Minister ordered the preparation for the test,0
Within the next 20 months, India tested its first bomb.Indira Gandhi knew that the west would react harshly, but she had very little to lose,0
The west had already burnt its bridges in the 1971 episode and there was very little moral, economic, military or strategic argument that the west could make to stop India from going nuclear,0
By going nuclear, India is actually able to help its poor,0
Wars affect poor disproportionately and through the power of nuclear weapons, India was able to stop fighting wars,0
No one dares bomb a country with nuclear arsenal,0
India's last full scale war was in 1971,0
By proving its worth, India got recognized by the western powers on a more equal footing and the resulting large trade since late 90s has helped chunk of poor grow to middle class.The post-nuclear India is far better at protecting its people than the pre-nuclear India.,0
 Let's start with the assumption,0
Kashmiris Muslims hate India,0
Many do hate, but not all,0
What about the minority of Kashmiri Muslims that love India? What about their fate if the state is taken over by Pakistan? What about the fate of Kashmir's non-Muslims? The state of Jammu & Kashmir especially has large regions of Hindu and Buddhist populations whose fate is dreadful if India gives up the state,0
Protecting the millions of Kashmiris from chaos is what India wants,0
Because, we don't want another 1947 and another failed stated in the border.Why would India never give up Kashmir?The state of Hindus and Buddhists in Pakistan are far worse than the state of Muslims in India,0
The lives of few million people is worth the trouble.Indus waters through the state is essential for India's water security,0
Without that north India would be in a chaos.The high hills are also India's main defense for its northern plains,0
If J&K goes to Pakistan, Indian Punjab can be surrounded quite easily on 3 sides and the capital would be only a few hours drive from Pakistan,0
The state has already returned to peace and only recently turned to the voting booths in large numbers, placing their hopes on Indian democracy,0
India can always further reduce the anger by providing better infrastructure and having a more transparent law enforcement.,0
 Trying to catch the Indian Air Force napping, Yahya Khan, launched a Pakistani version of Israels 1967 air blitz in hopes that one rapid attack would cripple Indias far superior air power,0
But India was alert, Pakistani pilots were inept, and Yahyas strategy of scattering his thin air force over a dozen air fields was a bust!  -- Newsweek, 20 Dec 1971Pakistan officially began the war,0
The details are a bit more complicated though,0
The genesis of the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war lay in the 1970 Bhola cyclone - the deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in history and one that killed nearly half million people in East Pakistan,0
Remember, back then Pakistan had an eastern wing and an western wing.Pakistan's leadership was very slow to address the damage in a region it had traditionally ignored,0
Coincidentally, Pakistan had its national elections just 3 weeks after that disaster,0
The angry masses of East Pakistan whose traditional grievance got aggravated by the cyclone, came in large numbers to provide a thumping victory to Mujibur Rahman led Awami league,0
Pakistani general election, 1970This meant that the center of power had finally passed from the Punjab region to the Bengal region where Awami league was predominantly based,0
However, that didn't turn out to become a reality,0
Mujibur was never allowed to become the Prime Minister as the national assembly meeting [Parliament] to have these elected representatives vote their PM was postponed,0
By March, 4 months after the elections, the Awami league grew impatient and launched a non-cooperation movement,0
In response, Pakistan's President Yahya Khan imposed a martial law and a brutal repression of the Bengalis [especially the Bengali Hindus and Bengali intelligentsia] termed the Operation Searchlight.On 25th March, Mujib was arrested and taken to West Pakistan,0
This led a major outcry and a rebel commander named Ziaur Rahman declared the independence of East Pakistan on 26th March in a radio address,0
I, Major Ziaur Rahman, do hereby declare the Independence of Bangladesh in the name of our great leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.[This day is now celebrated as the Bangladesh independence day,0
After independence, Mujib would be the President until 1975 when he and most of his family was assassinated,0
Zia became the first dictator following him,0
Their daughters - Sheikh Hasina - daughter of Mujib and Khaleda Zia - wife of Zia are the two major leaders of present Bangladesh - keeping the rivalry alive to this day,0
Hasina and her sister were the lone survivors in their family's brutal assassination, as they were studying in Germany].Back to March 1971,0
As protests exploded in East Pakistan, refugees came in droves to India,0
The plight of Hindus especially moved India reminding of the brutal scenes of 1947,0
Indian PM Indira Gandhi assisted the rebels with money, training and arms,0
,0
Throughout that year things becoming getting worse for both India and Pakistan,0
Pakistan was now emboldened by the warmed relations with her two friends US & China and truly believed that the help of the major powers would help her "Crush India" - major campaign slogan across Pakistan,0
24 Crucial Facts About 1971 War When India Bifurcated PakistanBy the beginning of December, war was imminent,0
It was then that Yahya Khan tried what Israel did 4 years ago to the Arab countries,0
On Dec 3, he launched waves of planes to cripple Indian air defense and named it Operation Chengiz Khan,0
Unfortunately for Pakistan, despite all the inspiration it was neither the great Khan nor Israel,0
PAF tried to hit as far as Agra, but India had the Taj covered,0
[Partial covering shown below]India quickly hit back,0
At the height of the cold war, in it Pakistan was assisted in that war by Saudi Arabia, United States, United Kingdom, Indonesia, Sri Lanka,0
The bigger power China, expected to join, didn't,0
However, even with all that external support Pakistan could not face the onslaught of the much superior Indian forces,0
Soviet Union's task force too thwarted any US Navy involvement in the Bay of Bengal,0
1971 War: How Russia sank Nixons gunboat diplomacyPakistan, at the end, lost far more aircrafts, far more ships and far more men,0
It was cut into two and it surrendered within 12 days of the beginning of the war,0
Instrument of Surrender (1971),0
It was a stunning collapse from the euphoria of catching Indians napping to surrendering tens of thousands of men in an embarrassing surrender - all under two weeks.ConsequencesIt was a defining moment in Indian history,0
It was one of its biggest military victories in the modern era,0
It led to its later confident rise.Cutting up Pakistan's access to most of the Indian ocean & South East Asia with the loss of Bangladesh was a huge strategic gain for India,0
This was the only war when US and India came close to facing off against each other,0
Only Soviet Union's nuclear triad put out this nasty standoff,0
The value of nuclear deterrence was far clear to India now and India went nuclear not long after this war - Smiling Buddha.While Pakistan's military spun up their military disappointments positively in 1948 and 1965, in 1971 it was hard to cover up the defeat,0
Bifurcation of the nation even with the world's leading powers supporting it, was too hard for the military to explain away,0
Thus, Pakistan switched its whole strategy to covert warfare fronted by rebels and 1971 became the last full scale war between the two countries,0
The victory eventually allowed India to build friendships with the countries that sided Pakistan - US, UK, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka,0
External powers bet on the winning horse and Indira Gandhi ensured that hers was the top dog in South Asia and not Pakistan.,0
 Let's separate Qatar & Brunei from Luxembourg, Singapore, Hong Kong, Liechtenstein etc,0
Qatar has the world's third largest deposits of natural gas and has less than 300,000 citizens,0
If you divide that large a resource among that small a population you get crazy high income,0
Apart from the energy, it doesn't have any important industry worth mentioning,0
Brunei is somewhat close to that description.Regarding Singapore, Hong Kong, Luxembourg etc they are trading cities sitting next to massive countries,0
Cities are in general wealthier than the countryside,0
If Mumbai and Shanghai were counted as independent countries, they have a higher GDP than Singapore and Hong Kong compressed in a comparable geographic area,0
List of cities by GDP,0
Does that mean Mumbai and Shanghai are better than Singapore and Hong Kong? By being counted in larger nations with much higher rural population their GDPs are sometimes less appreciated.Thus, it is not about being a small country or a large country,0
It is about being a city sitting in an important trade route vs,0
a rural region stuck somewhere,0
Singapore is a small rich city-state in an important trade route while Nauru is a small poor rural nation that has no such benefit,0
In the same way, USA is an large rich urbanized nation with massive amount of trade while India is a large poor rural nation with far less trade,0
While we should surely learn a lot from Singapore and Hong Kong, we should also make sure we are comparing apples vs apples - Singapore vs commercial cities in a country than the entire country itself.,0
 Siddhartha was probably born in Nepal,0
But, Buddha was born in India ;-)That is a cheeky way of saying both nations can claim ownership of him and that the India-Nepal division didn't exist at the time of Buddha,0
In that sense, Buddha was like William the Conqueror who though born in what is now France is mostly associated as the King of England,0
Buddha was born in the capital town of the Shakya kingdom,0
There is no agreement on where exactly this capital was,0
There are 3 close towns that each claim to be the birthplace of Siddhartha and the capital of that kingdom,0
Two of them are in present day Nepal and one in present India,0
All 3 towns are along the modern India-Nepal border,0
ASI digs into Buddha home debate,0
PBS produced an award winning documentary on this topic in 2013 although it ends inconclusive,0
Bones of the BuddhaLumbini in Nepal is the most popular of the three,0
Given that Lumbini is in present Nepal, they have a part claim to his legacy,0
However, the prince who was born in that capital town achieved glory when he meditated under a Bodhi tree at Gaya, changed the world through his sermon at Sarnath and eventually claimed his divine abode in Kushinagar,0
All of these places are in present India,0
That means India can also claim his legacy regardless of whether Piprahwa was his birthplace or not.At the time of Buddha, the political boundaries were also different from that of today,0
India is a cultural union that touched almost all of the subcontinent, but the political boundaries were often different from that,0
Here is India at the time of Buddha and the kingdoms straddled the present day borders,0
,0
 Doesn't look to align with India's strategic interests,0
Building modern states along ethnic lines is something that doesn't fit with India's model of multi-ethnicity and it is fraught with dangers,0
If India supports Kurdish identity [who span multiple modern nations - Iran, Iraq, Syria, Turkey] what about the question of Nagas who span India and Myanmar,0
That is dangerous,0
Recognizing a Kurdish state might bring India directly in conflict with Iran, Turkey and Iraq,0
Iran is a traditional friend and with Turkey India is trying to open new relationships,0
Traditionally India has avoided such touchy, controversial issues and it would ideally push for Kurds to be worked into the national framework wherever they live.,0
 The premise is disputed,0
I will still take the bite,0
India is traditionally resource-constrained, while Europe & US is labor constrained,0
India has a lot of labor, and Europe-US have a lot of resources,0
This have an impact on the respective lifestyles.In the US, I can easily afford a Dishwasher, have access to reliable water and lot of electricity,0
In India, my maid would wash with much lesser water and electricity than that,0
While driving, I use the automatic in the US as the gas/petrol prices are quite low and the decrease in efficiency is worth the comfort,0
In India, the resource price is higher and might go for a chauffeur driving a manual,0
Most Indian families do fine in the US as they quickly adjust to the new society as above,0
They don't miss their maids and chauffeurs much.Things get tricky when you have a child,0
Unlike dishwashing or vacuuming, childcare cannot be automated and thus it is fairly hard to raise kids,0
You need to constantly look after them, run after them and clean after them,0
This is where many Indians miss labor abundance back home,0
Thus, many Indians ask the help of their parents to help with the kids,0
Locals too have huge trouble managing kids without nannies, but they have a wider support network [parents, siblings, friends, cousins] locally while Indians in US often have none,0
In summary, it is not about daily chores there is a problem,0
It is in raising kids where expat Indians often face a pain,0
Kids are lovely, but also take up a lot of energy to manage.,0
 Other than the 19-20th century CE, cold weather regions were not really ahead of the economies of warmer regions,0
Historically, the civilization was centered around warm, tropics & subtropics,0
The first 5 civilizations - Sumer, Nile valley, Indus Valley, Yellow river valley, Norte Chico - were all in subtropics,0
The ones that followed - in Greece, Persia, Rome were in the same zone too,0
Subtropics often were better than tropics because the latter was often next to dense rainforests with wildlife & epidemic dangers,0
Still the warmer regions performed better throughout history.Colonialism changed this dynamic for the first time,0
I will explain this how,0
The cold weather regions have very low population density as not many people preferred cold winters,0
This allowed the farmers to have much larger lands and more potential mines & mineral resources,0
Until the modern era, these were hard to tap though.When industrial revolution came, the technology drastically helped those in cold climates,0
Mechanised farming - tractors and other machines - allowed industrial scale farming over those lands,0
This allowed the farmers to get rich because they had now huge lands that could be fully tapped,0
Factories also could now get minerals resources and infrastructure as large parts of their countries were sparsely occupied,0
In contrast, industrial revolution could not do much to densely populated tropics that already had high farming productivity - but shared by a large number of farmers,0
Tropics were too densely populated - meaning lesser resources & lesser room or infrastructure.Other aspect colonialism did was to open up huge markets,0
England had a small domestic market - population was small,0
But, through its colonies it got a huge market for its textile mills and industries,0
In earlier times there was not much international trade and thus those in sparsely populated regions could not benefit from their innovations.In 21st century CE, we are entering a post-industrial era and the pendulum might be shifting again,0
Mines and lands are not as important as they were in say 20th century,0
It is about the number of minds networked,0
In this, the subtropics/tropics such as California, Singapore, Shanghai or Bangalore are getting back in the game,0
The size of the domestic market matters big once again - as Californian startups could attest and density helps in various other ways too for an information economy.,0
 On October 12, 2015 a couple of radicals allegedly stole a copy of Guru Granth Sahib [holiest book of Sikhism] and these torn pages have emerged from a variety of places,0
Sikhs were enraged by this desecration and there are protests across Punjab,0
To make things worse, couple of protesters were killed in the police firing, further aggravating the situation,0
Why are Indian Sikhs angry?There are a variety of speculation on who might have done this tearing,0
One of the accused is a controversial sect called Dera Sacha Sauda whose leader Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is facing several criminal cases on unrelated cases,0
Couple of weeks ago, he stirred controversy with an offensive propaganda movie - MSG-2 The Messenger.Indian media is also claiming "foreign" links with the usual suspect - Pakistan's intelligence agency believed to have been behind this,0
Lot of speculation and little clarity.Intelligence Agencies Warned of ISI Plot to Create Trouble in PunjabPunjab desecration case: 2 brothers with foreign links held,0
 Many nationalist Indians would say yes,0
And once India has joined Nepal, there would be reallocation of seats in the legislature,0
Given India's size and population, 95% of the Nepali parliament would be Indians,0
These legislators would then pass a law to change the name of the country to India and change some of the national symbols,0
The rest of it would not have to change much as India and Nepal share a common culture,0
Job done ;-)I always smile when nationalists of other countries desire for a large chunk of India,0
There is the "Greater Nepal" or "Khoarsan", "Mughalistan" etc,0
If a sizable chunk of India is joined with Nepal or Pakistan or whatever other country, that resulting county would be Hindu by the sheer size of Indian population,0
Thus, Indians would be the dominant population in that "Greater Nepal" and they would legislate a variety of things that Nepalese might not like.,0
 Around the world people do crazy things to appear attractive,0
The whole world of cosmetics and cosmetic surgeries would be out of business if people stopped being insecure of their beauty,0
Think of tanning salons, sunbathing, fairness creams, tattoos, skin piercing..,0
people in every part of the world do dangerous things in their pursuit of beauty,0
And this didn't start in modern era, but is as old as human civilization,0
Tribes around the world have painted their faces in all sorts of fancy colors for ceremonial reasons as well as for aesthetic reasons.We probably carry innate animal tendencies to spend effort on looking for our mate and make ourselves attractive in the process,0
Skin is a good indicator of a body's health and thus people do all sorts of things to make the skin appear good to "prospective mates",0
In some places, tribes would abandon their children or even kill if they were born light skinned (Persecution of people with albinism),0
In other places, being born as dark skinned would bring discrimination,0
It is all about what each society thinks of being healthy,0
And in modern world most often these are stupid intolerance,0
Also see: Why are Indians color obsessed?,0
 As others mention, Japan and Germany have a sizable military,0
That said, post Second World War, both Japan and Germany put strong anti-war provisions in their Constitutions,0
This was partly pushed by the allies controlling their territory and partly came about as the moderates came out in disgust of the calamity,0
Article 9 of the Japanese ConstitutionThe world war also pushed out the hard right wing out of power for a long time,0
The prospect of having a highly weak army that would invariably draw comparisons with their military past also meant that military's purpose was strictly defined to domestic security,0
Also, the need for a large military became moot after the US military umbrella promised them to secure their resources,0
Hitler went after Russia to secure oil in its south,0
Japan went after SE Asia to secure iron ore and other raw materials,0
Post-WW2, both nations got all their major resource access protected by US and this provided very little rationale for war,0
In some sense, western nations pay an implicit tax to the US in return for US fighting wars to protect all of their trade routes and raw materials,0
This is Adam Smith's specialization.,0
 It was a marriage of convenience primarily connected by their common fear of the Soviet Union,0
Both hated the Communists and in the 1930s signed an anti-Comintern pact,0
Otherwise there was little ideology overlap as Hitler thought China to be their ally and Japan was looking at UK,0
As China entered into a pact with USSR, Hitler moved to Japan and as Hitler was gaining on UK, Japan wanted to pick the winning side in Europe.Later, both found US to be a huge threat and feared the entry of US against them,0
This moved them even closer and once US entered the war against Japan, Germany too declared war,0
Ultimately both fought two different wars,0
While we simplistically group them as WW2 just because the Allies fought both, there was not much overlap between the Pacific and the Atlantic war,0
They started and ended on different times, involved different motivations and strategies and didn't even share much of troops or resources due to geographical barriers.,0
 It starts with energy - natural gas and oil,0
Iran is right next door to India and has plenty of gas and India is extremely energy insecure,0
It is a match made in heaven,0
All other sources of energy are far from India and through expensive ships sailing across piracy infested routes.Then there is history,0
India and Iran are very strongly related culturally throughout history,0
They share the same race, same family of languages,0
Iran means the "land of the Aryans" and Arya has superior connotations in India,0
Until Hitler came to misuse the term, it used to be much widely used,0
Hinduism and Zoroastrianism are sister religions worshipping the same gods,0
Later, Islam spread into India and Persian culture became widespread - in food, language etc,0
Then there is Afghanistan,0
India and Iran share very close ties with Afghanistan, which is often at conflict with at Pakistan's interests,0
It was the Indo-Iranian funded Northern Alliance that helped US win the Talibans,0
In the past few decades, Indo-Iranian ties went into strain as Iran went close to Pakistan & US in coldwar and later India went close to Iraq & Israel,0
These are now getting rebuilt,0
Iran likes India more than any other country and India in turn has a favorite outlook of Iran,0
Attitudes towards Countries,0
 War is one of the biggest motivators to bring new technology,0
WW2 drastically increased the money, motivation and political resources available for science,0
Two related factors that really revolutionized science was the Tizard Mission - where the UK effectively gave away all its tech secrets to the US so as to build enough weapons to counter Germany,0
The second one was the German scientists who were then given the resources of US and USSR after the war to build massive projects,0
US got to moon with a Nazi scientist,0
Space explorationNazi Germany originally developed the V-2 rocket to hit Britain,0
It was the world's first ballistic missile,0
After the war, US and USSR split up Germany and got a large number of these German missiles, facilities and scientists,0
This is how both countries got to space in the 1950s,0
Nuclear ResearchThe Manhattan project to develop the atom bomb was the largest ever research project until that time,0
The race to build the bomb produced major breakthroughs,0
A decade post the war, Soviet Union [again with the help of German scientists] began civilian production of electricity and two decades later it became a key energy source for the world.MedicineAlthough Fleming had invented Penicillin in 1928, it was not put to wide use,0
It just stayed low until war needed it,0
Suddenly it was produced at massive numbers and had a major change in global health,0
The cavity Air travelUntil 1940s, air travel was primarily for the adventurers,0
The main issue was the cabin was not pressurized leading to very high discomfort when flying high,0
For the war, Boeing produced B-29 that had cabin pressure and this quickly became a standard in civilian aircrafts,0
How Things Work: Cabin Pressure,0
Radars, radio navigation and a variety of things needed for modern aircraft have their origins in the war,0
More importantly, we now had Jet engines due to the war allowing much higher speed and range of airplanes,0
CookingMicrowave oven really became a practicality only when cavity magnetron was invented,0
Someone (Percy Spencer) working at Raytheon found melting chocolate in his pocket and that became the motivation for the oven.ComputingWhile computers were around for more than a century, they never got major government patronage or big use case,0
The need to break enigma machine provided all the resources needed to make a computer work,0
Without the war, introduction of computers might have been delayed by a couple of decades.,0
 Every god needs a satan,0
Every revolution needs an enemy to turn people's anger upon.Iran and Israel historically had good relationships,0
Iran helped Israel in this war against Egypt, and in turn Israel helped Iran fight Iraq,0
However, the 1979 islamic revolution needed an enemy,0
The Ayatollah could not make Saudi Arabia his #1 enemy as the place is too sacred for Muslims,0
Israel and US became the easy enemy,0
Even when they have often worked together behind the scenes, there has to be a public appearance of beating the enemy and this is important in every revolution,0
Israel and US helped the Shah & indirectly helped fight the revolution,0
This was one of the angers,0
Israel stands in Iran's way to develop nuclear weapons,0
Iran uses its proxy armies in Hizbollah and Hamas to control the region and this affects Israel's interests,0
Iran also wants to be seen as the leader of Islam and shouting for Palestinian interests brings credibility & attention.The Iran-Iraq war of 1980s provided a period of common interests,0
In 1988, the end of Iran-Iraq war and the scandal of the IranContra affair [involving US-Israeli arms trade to Iran] pushed Israel & Iran back,0
Iran also moved closer to Saudi Arabia this time,0
For both sides there is a fear of survival,0
Iranian government fears the failure of revolution if the lightning rod of their hatred - Israel goes away and people warm up to western ideas & culture,0
Israel government fears the further expansion of Hezbollah and Hamas.,0
 Two years ago the media was talking about whether India was becoming the "rape capital" of the world,0
Now, there is very less mention of rapes,0
Has India suddenly become a great country for women in a matter of months?While Dadri is a terrible tragedy and we must make sure mob justice is prevented & law order handled, we must also be careful not to take media as the barometer for what is happening in the country,0
One swallow doesn't a summer make,0
If just one incident alone would make a nation go from normal state to extremist state, we must either be setting an impossibly high bar for ourselves or we are just kidding ourselves,0
Hate crimes happen across the world and this is why we have police and courts,0
If people stopped criminal activities, we would not be needing police,0
To objectively judge India is getting intolerant/extremist, we need to define some variables [say deaths from communal violence], take the trend over a period of time and also compare that with other nations,0
I have quote a few statistics here: Is India gradually becoming intolerant as claimed by the Sahitya academy winners? and it doesn't look like India is getting any more extremist,0
The beef issue is centuries old,0
Indians never really revolt,0
But, in 1857 they did and ended East India Company partly because they suspected there might be beef in the gun cartridges used,0
There was no RSS/BJP back then,0
Imagining that beef controversy is just specific to BJP or 2015 is being totally ignorant of Indian history,0
Pretending that people just started caring about it now or it is somehow related to Modi is ignorant,0
We have had riots for beef well before modern India, well before politics,0
Every culture has its own set of taboos (Why are the British revolted by the idea of horsemeat?) and not paying attention to it is not smart,0
Let's again put this in perspective with the rest of the world,0
Let's get into the concept of hate crimes - violence motivated by religion, ethnicity etc,0
[Violent hate crime,0
International Statistics],0
Leave alone West Asia or Pakistan,0
The most peaceful Canada has 1200 hate crimes a year with 1/40 of India's population (Police-reported hate crime in Canada, 2013) and highly developed Sweden has about 6500 hate violence incidents (Record increase in Swedish hate crimes) with 1/120 of Indian population,0
France and Ireland have far more,0
India too is likely to have lakhs of such incidents every year,0
If you want to start counting all the ink throwing, all the harrassments in a country with 1.3 billion people - you will need a lot of fingers,0
Only difference is that the national media in other countries don't cover each individual hate crime in lurid detail,0
They focus on patterns, trends, statistics when they report crime,0
This is not to justify violence, but helping you understand reality,0
Taking a handful of crime incidents to brand India more violent than other nations is stupid,0
World is a violent, hate-filled place and finger pointing doesn't help change for better.In summary, it is an unfortunate incident and a crime,0
We must look to solve them,0
However, let us also not exaggerate one incident and take it to label a whole nation,0
If we do that, we could put any label on any community.,0
 For centuries, Japan was a frontier region that enjoyed a fair amount of cultural influences from China, while still remaining independent,0
In many senses, it resembles Britain that again was a frontier for a long time looking up to the empires of the mainland,0
In the 19th century both had enlightened monarchs (Queen Victoria and Emperor Meiji) who ruled a very long time and took their countries to their heights.Perry ExpeditionIn 19th century, Japan was under feudal lords with only a nominal power with the emperor,0
It was a very closed and stagnant society,0
This changed in 1854 when an American named Matthew C,0
Perry was dispatched by President Fillmore to force the opening up of Japan,0
There was both a religious missionary motivation as well as business motivation,0
US and China had a very booming trade capitalizing on China's fall and US wanted to extend that to Japan too,0
Perry Expedition and Gunboat diplomacy,0
With warships threatening Edo (Tokyo), the local chief Abe Masahiro had to give in and open trade with the west,0
Like in China and India, the trade with the west didn't go well for the Asian country as it was not in their terms,0
It was disastrous and shred the Japanese economy to pieces,0
To make matters worse there were massive earthquakes that shook Japan - in a physical as well as a metaphorical way,0
Ansei great earthquakesWithin a decade the Shogunate [rule of feudal lords] came to a dramatic end through public anger,0
The teenage emperor called Emperor Meiji took up the throne after his father was poisoned,0
In that time, the emperor formally ruled from Kyoto, although the real powers were with the Shoguns based in Edo (Tokyo),0
Meiji RestorationMeiji made Edo the formal east capital (now named Tokyo) with the recognition of economic power,0
He abolished feudalism with powers moving out of the Shoguns, Daimyos and Samurais,0
That said, many believe that oligarchs still had a quite a large power even after the restoration.The emperor brought a modern army by extending the power to bear arms beyond just the samurai,0
The disgruntled samurai were then employed in various government bureaucracy,0
The transition to modern army and navy made Japan stand out in Asia and allowed it to eventually deal with the west on more equal terms.In parallel, there was a massive industrial revolution,0
A ministry of industry was created in 1870 and a whole bunch of industrial conglomerates called the Zaibatsu arose,0
Literacy rose quickly and women were employed in large numbers by the nascent industries,0
This crashed the birth rates and the,0
 newly liberated classes were now openly adopting western culture and clothes after centuries of domination by the samurais,0
In the 40 year period from 1872, railways went 400x from 18km to 7100km,0
Coal production multiplied 30 times,0
Silk production multiplied 10 times and merchant ships multiplied 60 times.20th century warsThe massive growth of economy, partially helped by lack of competition in Asia, and a modern army brought a very aggressive Japan at the turn of the 20th century,0
Its first victim was Russian Empire and the defeat of Russia in 1905 was a major coup,0
Getting recognition from this, Japan fought with the allies in WW1,0
After WW1 it felt cheated that it got none of the colonies from the losing powers and tried to go on its own,0
With a very hungry domestic economy, it had to go for more and more resources,0
This led it to occupy Korea, China and eventually most of East Asia,0
Their aggression and ambition was matched by Nazis on the west and thus they both entered into a marriage of convenience, although neither side really liked the other,0
As Japan feared the entry of the US into the war, it tried to preempt by attacking Pearl Harbor in Hawaii,0
Their gamble failed due to multiple reasons including not attacking Hawaii's oil stores and aircraft carriers,0
This left US only partially wounded, but very angry,0
US had its revenge in a war that climaxed with the dropping of atom bombs.Post-war reconstructionJapan was thoroughly beaten and totally disgusted with war,0
They put in their constitution to effectively outlaw war and put all their energies in economy,0
US liked such a distraction as that would mean Japan would not become a major threat and also be its big trading partner in Asia, especially after China fell to the Communists in 1949,0
Gen,0
Douglas MacArthur was especially instrumental in this transformation,0
After the Korean war in 1950s and rise of cold war, Japan became US' principal ally in the Pacific - bringing more aid, more technology and more trade,0
While the war left the infrastructure broken, it left a highly educated and motivated populace who could now rebuild the cities with the state of the art 20th century technology instead of saddled with old infrastructure,0
Japanese government and its Ministry of International Trade and Industry on its part did a fantastic job pushing their corporations to dominate world trade,0
With rising education, falling fertility, Japan enjoyed a massive demographic dividend - with parents totally focusing on careers unimpeded by children [or so they thought that time].,0
 Landlocked: India's least developed states - Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh are all landlocked,0
Access to sea is a huge factor especially in modern era centered on global trade,0
Obviously, this alone is not a factor as a few states like Punjab are developed despite being landlocked.Government expenditures: Here is the table of how the governments spent their development expenditures per person,0
Bihar and UP got the least resource allocation, while states like Punjab got as many as 5 times per capita allocation,0
Part of this reason could be higher population of Bihar for which it was punished many times,0
For a long time Bihar & UP got very less dams, irrigation projects, roads, railways, airports or any such infrastructure,0
Political circus: Between 1961 and 2005, Bihar's leadership changed as many as 30 times,0
List of Chief Ministers of Bihar Political instability meant no one would invest in the state,0
In the 1990s, when India was getting large foreign investments, Bihar that accounted for more than 10% of the population received only 0.10% of the FDI,0
As anarchy loomed, caste became far more important for organization than in most other states,0
No new urban development: Madras, Bombay, Bangalore, Calcutta, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, New Delhi are all modern cities - built in the past 400 years and with the technology of present time,0
Bihar and UP have no such cities,0
There is an excessive reliance on ancient towns such as Patna and Gaya - built for different times,0
While Patna was expanded a bit in the British era [with the addition of the "New" City], no new cities were built from scratch for such a massive population,0
With no cities & modern jobs, Biharis have to travel as far as Mumbai and New Delhi and often face brunt of xenophobia.Extremely large political units: Bihar and UP are too large political units,0
They have more people than all but 10 countries,0
This makes governance very hard,0
Even in the past, Bihar was part of monstrous political units such as Bengal that had more people than the next largest units - Madras and Bombay combined,0
List of states in India by past population While the split of states in 2000 helped the smaller Bihar grow fast, it is still too big to govern and its past poor growth still impacts,0
Industrial policy: Bihar had a large textile industry that mostly vanished in the British Raj,0
Colonists made peasants grow crops like Indigo and this led to wide agricultural crisis prompting leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi to launch his satyagraha at Champaran,0
In independent India, the freight policy that provided practically free transportation for Bihar's raw materials all over the country meant that industries chose the coastal towns instead of locating closer to the resources,0
No major reforms: After independence, Indian government started its land reforms to take lands away from exploiting feudal lords,0
In the south it succeeded,0
In the gangetic plains, it didn't,0
Feudal Zamindars had a huge sway from UP to West Bengal until recently,0
Here is a good paper on this from which all the data in the post was sourced and goes deeper into the factors,0
Page on tandfonline.comAlso see: Causes for Development Disparity between the Indias North and the South,0
 Two very different issues.In case of the Tibet dam, China was not building in any river, but one of the key water sources for India and Bangladesh,0
The dam is the largest in Tibet and the river serves over 100 million people,0
Tibet's largest hydropower station starts full operation,0
In a water scarce subcontinent there will ofcourse be worries when rivers crossing multiple nations are dammed this way,0
If the river were not a shared resource there would have been no concerns.In case of the South China sea lighthouse, the lighthouses are made over disputed reefs in an area claimed by half-dozen countries,0
Over $5 trillion of world shipping moves through them and no one wants a war/conflict there,0
China completes construction of lighthouses in disputed South China Sea,0
If those lighthouses were not in disputed reefs there would have been no issues.If you see these issues from the other side of the table, you can see why they can be worrisome.,0
 Other than a couple of its neighbours, India's relations with the rest of the world is fairly ok,0
Most of India's hostilities are dated post-1947 and precursors of the present Indian state didn't have major enmities with the rest of the world,0
India's key enmity is with Pakistan,0
The brutal breakup of India to form Pakistan in 1947, the bloodshed accompanying this partition, the non-resolution of things in Jammu & Kashmir still keeps the hostilities alive,0
India and Pakistan have fought 4 wars.With China, India's conflict is more nuanced,0
India and China historically coexisted without much conflict,0
Their only conflict is traced to a brief border tussle in 1962,0
However, outsider powers have always played a role,0
China's relationship with Pakistan and India's historic relationship with US & USSR has played hidden games,0
What are all the conflicts between India and China?With Nepal, India has had a cordial relationships despite occasional roadblocks like what is happening over the past few weeks [autumn 2015],0
In Myanmar, India has a neutral stand with potential for deeper relationships,0
With Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bangladesh, there has been moments of highs and lows,0
India helped Bangladesh win independence from Pakistan and helped Sri Lanka win over Tamil terrorist outfits,0
In Maldives it helped fight coups,0
In Bhutan, India has the most friendliest of its neighbors with no major tussles,0
Afghanistan would be the second friendliest neighbor for India although the Taliban period strained the relations temporarily,0
FriendshipsIndia's closest ally is probably Israel and both nations significantly underplay their friendships to their public,0
India doesn't want to irk its friends in the Islamic world and Israel plays along.After Israel, India's key friends are US and USSR,0
US has had key interests in the subcontinent and in general helped better peace despite its friendship with Pakistan,0
With Russia, India has had very cosy relationships through most of the cold war although that friendships are a little low now,0
In France, Germany and Japan, India has its biggest technology & defense partners,0
These relationships are getting stronger as of 2015.In the commercial sector, India's closest friends are Singapore and Mauritius - both with a huge population of people with Indian ancestry and key conduits of capital into India,0
With countries of British commonwealth - UK, Australia, Canada, Caribbean etc, India has a somewhat positive relationship with Cricket providing both the friendliness and rift [India Cricket board is among the most hated],0
These ties have not been fully capitalized until now.In Africa, India has some kinship relationships and there has been traditional warmth on both sides,0
However, this has not translated into trade or geopolitics until recently,0
India's ties in South East Asia is somewhat similar,0
There are historic relations and buddy relations developed from colonization and period of Non Aligned nations,0
But, only recently they are getting translated to economy.In West Asia, India has a lukewarm friendship,0
It has a lot of interest in the region including oil and immigrants, but the region's friendship with Pakistan and some of India's domestic troubles have not made this into a deeper friendship,0
Iran and UAE are probably India's closest friends in the region at present, although in the past there were warm ties with Iraq and Egypt,0
In Latin America and Central Asia, India's relationships are very limited and mostly focused on oil exploration,0
There is a long way to go there.Looking ForwardOne advantage going for India is that its hostile powers are not that well regarded internationally as of 2015,0
Pakistan, for instance, is widely seen as the culprit although only a few decades ago the shoe was on the other foot.India was also not exploiting its diaspora around the world and focused too narrowly on its strategic interests,0
In the past few years, there is a welcome change as the diaspora is used to build new bridges,0
There is much more focus on economics and geopolitics than any time in India's past,0
This pragmatic thinking is making for more involved relationship with the rest of the world.One thing that might surprise you is finding who looks India's influence positively,0
It is Iran, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Nigeria,0
Those are all the countries in which India has not fully engaged in trade relationships,0
Attitudes towards Countries,0
 Contrary to popular myth, every part of India had its own mighty warrior classes,0
Valour is not regional,0
That is how you could have great empires emerging from every part of India,0
If Sikhs were the only martial group, we would have had the rest of India ruled by their empires,0
There were 18 major martial classes in British India: Martial races of undivided India and much more before that,0
How come there are more Sikhs in army and less Sikhs at the top? There is one theory that is used in a few places like this book: Civilian Control of the Military (pg,0
49),0
Indian politicians have always feared the military's incursion into democracy and followed principles from British Raj to carefully engineer the army,0
One of the key principles is to keep one group of loyal minorities form the army and some other loyal minorities run the army leadership,0
Of the first 20 Indian Chief of the Army Staff, there were two Kannadigas (Cariappa, Thimayya), two Tamils (Kumaramangalam, Sundarji), two Telugus (Shriganesh, Rao), two Gujaratis (Jadeja, Manekshaw), two Jammu Kashmiris (Malhotra, Vij), two Marathis (Rodrigues, Vaidya), two Bengalis (Chowdhuri and Roychowdhury), two Punjabis (Thapar, Raina) one each from MP (Bewoor), Kerala (Padmanaban), Uttarakhand (Joshi) and NWFP (Malik),0
One thing we can see is the spread of regions - from Kashmir to Bengal to Gujarat to Kerala, although the army is far less heterogeneous,0
This way no one region gets too powerful when it comes to heading the Army,0
Next we see their tenures shorter [typically about 2 years vs 4 years in case of countries like the US] preventing them to become too settled,0
The third is that Army Chiefs are carefully selected from places [such as south India, Bengal or Kashmir] that would neither align with the bulk of army [drawn from Sikhs, Gorkhas in more numbers] nor align with the bulk of the population [political power in the Gangetic valley],0
This seems too precise to have evolved on its own without some political engineering,0
In the past 10 though it seems army leadership getting less engineered [finally Sikhs get their due credit at the top with two Chiefs of Staff] as the government finally stopped fearing the army, but instead sees a bigger role for the defense as India aspires to be a superpower.,0
 I don't believe in Aryan Invasion Theory, because there was nothing called Aryans [Indo Europeans is the right term], there is no proof for an invasion [of Indian kingdoms] and it is not a theory [more of a speculation],0
The Aryan Race: Time to Forget About It?The Aryan theory is mostly fantasy used by both Indologists and Hindus with the script that a few racially pure [Arya] fair skinned folks riding the chariots just swept past vast chunks of the world, including India, winning the "inferior" dark skinned people who were too weak to fight a handful of invaders,0
This theory was liked by Hitler, many extremists Hindus as well as many extremist non-Hindus,0
It is time we put a rest to it,0
While I do believe that there is a strong commonality between European, Indian and Iranian cultures and there surely were human migrations, I don't believe in the idea that a vast chunk of India is populated by a handful of outsiders who moved around 3500 years ago,0
Math doesn't add up there,0
Population doesn't add upIndia was densely populated as early as 500 BCE based on Arrian's and other outsider accounts of India,0
To account for 50-100 million people who made India's population then after clearing the vast chunks of the subcontinent battling dense tropical jungles, malaria & other diseases, it requires a few thousand years of migrations and not just couple of centuries,0
India has been invaded so many times in the past and so it is not hard to believe that India was invaded by Central Asians,0
But, in all the invasions we know of since then [of Afghans, Hunas, Europeans], only political control was changed, not the populace,0
England came with the most modern of invasions and ruled centuries with all the technology, but with little change in the population itself [Anglo Indians form a miniscule population],0
So what was so special in the invasions of circa 1500 BCE that was so different from the later invasions that the population itself changed? How did the cold weather people so swiftly get used to India's brutal climate that no subsequent invader really survive?For a few thousand Central Asians unused to India's weather and diseases, with inferior technology, to just sweep across the subcontinent so efficiently that there is no trace at all for invasions, master agriculture, complete a total domination of culture and multiply into tens of millions requires a major suspension of disbelief,0
It requires far more proof than what is offered.Writing systemsOne of the migration thesis called the Kurgan hypothesis believes the Aryans migrated into India crossing Mesopotamia,0
Many of these groups including the Mittanis and Hittites who are closely connected to the Vedas had their own written languages, while the Vedic Indians apparently didn't,0
How come the Indo-Aryans who migrated past Mesopotamia and whose various branches developed written scripts, forget all that as they enter India? To me, it makes more sense in a reverse migration where the Vedic Indians who didn't have scripts migrated out and learnt written languages as they settled in Mesopotamia and other places creating Mittani, Kassite and Hittite kingdoms.GeneticsThis is again controversial,0
There is some evidence that Indians, Central Asians,0
 and Iranians have close relationships,0
But, we also find that the genetic distance between the various castes of north India and those of various Indian tribes and the south Indians is very, very small,0
In other words, almost all Indians [north and south] have quite close genetics regardless of this Aryan-Dravidan debate,0
Also see: Indian ancestry revealedI again accept that Indians and Central Asians do have strong links, but it is equally likely for sparsely populated Central Asians to come via more denser regions [as tribes were moved around] than a billion nation people with very close genetics to all come from a few thousand people group in 3000 years.Here is a very good paper that debunks the massive migration around 1500 BCE in a more formal way,0
Genetics and the Aryan Debate.Page on sciencedirect.comModeling of the observed haplotype diversities suggests that both Indian ancestry components are older than the purported Indo-Aryan invasion 3,500 YBP,0
What about the Horse?Various debaters in this topic beat up the dead horse,0
The apparent absence of the horse in Indus Valley seals while its copious presence is used as the key support for the Aryan Invasion Theory,0
In the recent decades far more finds of horses in India have been made,0
Although the issue is far from solved, the belief that there were no horses in the subcontinent before 2000 BCE is fading away,0
This is discussed in this book: The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture : The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate and The Horse and the Aryan Debate by Michel DaninoWhat are the alternatives?There a few other speculations.The migration happened over a long period of time - probably 1000s of years,0
This would account for India's large population and also be consistent with how the Vedic Indians didn't have written scripts while their companions in Mesopotamia and elsewhere did,0
The migration started from India instead of Central Asia,0
Indigenous Aryans,0
This is still very speculative at the moment and there are again plenty of holes in it,0
However, it would fit with the collapse of Indus Valley Civilization,0
As a massive civilization collapsed there around 1500 BCE it is possible for the millions of its inhabitants to migrate in various directions including India, West and Central Asia leading to the widespread chaos of the time,0
Those millions must have gone somewhere as the civilization collapsed,0
Page on uwf.eduSummary:The origin of Indo-Europeans in India is a controversial topic and there is no proof from either side of the debate,0
On both sides there are vested interests - one group wants to prove Hindu civilization as superior and other group bent upon proving it as inferior,0
The truth suffers inbetween.As mentioned above there are far too many holes in a major migration into India 3500 years Before Present,0
Although there is not much proof yet, my hunch is that the exodus of Indus Valley civilization was the source of Indo-European cultures,0
IVC a culture that collapsed that time and whose massive population likely migrated all around from their desertified land,0
I wish there is more research on that.Also see:Indians are not descendants of Aryans, says new study and ICHR debate on Aryan invasion theory cut short,0
 There is nothing specific about India here,0
Discussing politics is fraught with a lot of dangers both online and offline,0
Regardless of the side you are in, you will get a regular amount of garbage and harassment,0
Everyday I open my notifications, 5-6 comments fall into the abusive category,0
Some of them simple garbage like one below and others complex garbage with unprintable statements,0
Sometimes the commentors really get to the point instead of adding all those sentences around:You don't think this is harassment? It is and done by people often from leftwing in my case,0
However, I cannot generalize that to say leftwingers are harassers,0
It is just that users of all political groups harass people who don't agree to their idea.This sort of trolling is the reality regardless of the political subject you take up,0
The higher the stakes, the more venomous is this harassment,0
Thus, you might be able to get away with a controversial topic related to a small city in Croatia than say a major political topic in US,0
In religion related topics the venom can be even more severe on both sides,0
Some tips on handling this:Be reasonable: Temper your statements and be respectful in your criticisms and gracious in accepting one,0
It will not solve everything, but it will reduce the attacks,0
For instance, saying "India is s***, the nation s****" will expectedly bring back sharper comments,0
The question details fails this point #1,0
Be the solution: There are things people hold dear and when you try to abuse those things, people react bad,0
Don't fight the people practicing an idea, but just stick to the idea itself,0
Even in the idea focus on the bad features alone,0
The more specific it is, better is the response,0
Example 1: India is a shitty place for women,0
BAD Example 2: Female infanticide is rampant in places like Dharmapuri,0
We need to extend the cradle baby scheme & have stringent punishments,0
BETTER.Report & block: For some groups, politeness doesn't work,0
Shouting match doesn't work either,0
Look to use "Report" and "block" feature where real abuse is concerned,0
I block 2-3 people a day for severe abuse,0
Abuse grows proportional to the number of people you reach.Accept: The moment you are expressing a strong opinion and hoping people accept it, you are in politics,0
At the end of the day, politics is an aggressive place no matter what side you are in,0
That is a sobering and disgusting reality.,0
 They will not sue you and this won't ruin your life,1
They will likely (but not necessarily) revoke your offer though.As for other people saying that this isn't cheating, but rather you just demonstrated that you can solve business problems efficiently: Please don't listen to their justifications,1
You seem like an otherwise honest person, or at least someone who strives to be that way,1
Don't let them throw you off your ethical track.If the rules of the interview -- implicit or explicit -- were that you can't look up things during the interview, then you cheated,1
Period.Of course, in the business world, you can use Google,1
But interviewers don't ask you a question to figure out if you could solve this question in the real world,1
They ask you to derive some information about you (your depth of knowledge, your problem solving skills, etc),1
From there, they make a guess at your ability to do the work.You cheated,1
You gave them a false impression of your skills because you broke the rules.Nothing will ever remove the fact that you cheated,1
It already happened,1
The only thing you can change is whether you got your job by cheating.The question is: Do you want this new job so badly that you're willing to sit with the knowledge for the rest of your life that you kicked off your career and got ahead with dishonesty? From what you said, I believe that you're a generally honest person (perhaps even exceptionally honest) who made a mistake,1
I'd worry that you'd end up being pretty unhappy at this company as you might never really feel right in the role.The company might still decide to take you if you confess,1
Maybe,1
Or maybe they'll decide to just reinterview you,1
Or maybe you'll wind up somewhere else in the end,1
None of these are ideal situations, but at least you will have no longer gotten ahead via dishonesty,1
If you do confess, I wouldn't use the word "cheating." I would just describe the situation honestly:Although I'm really excited about the opportunities at <company>, I wanted to be honest about my interviews,1
While the interviewers asked me questions, I looked up answers online,1
I feel that this might have been a key factor in the offer decisions and I feel pretty uncomfortable about this at an ethical level,1
I worry that my use of the Internet might have made me seem more qualified than I am.This is behavior is really out of character for me, and I really regret my actions,1
That's why I wanted to let you know what had happened and see how to proceed.I expect that you will likely revoke my offer with this disclosure, and I absolutely understand that decision (much as I would be disappointed),1
Alternatively, if you'd like to give me some additional interviews, I would love that opportunity too,1
I assure you that, regardless of your decision, this will never happen again with this company or another,1
I really value ethics in my personal and professional life, and I'm really sorry that I didn't act in accordance with my own standards.I can't tell you what to do, but I can say that you'll be much prouder of yourself if you decline the offer -- even if you don't confess what you did.Good luck.,1
 Not particularly,1
I think it's good to discuss what good interview processes look like.However, I do think that many people's points are poorly thought out,1
(Then again, I think the same thing about pretty much any issue, so it hardly makes it worse here.)Many people's logic is: "Algorithm interviews are broken because of X, therefore we should all switch to Y instead." The problem is that Y is also broken in its own ways,1
All interview processes have their flaws,1
Developer Interviews are Broken, and You Can't Fix ItThe other key logical problem people make is the assumption that the interview process should mirror "real life." That's not actually true,1
The interview should assess relevant, important skills, but it doesn't need to be "real life." In other cases, many people just don't understand what the process is all about,1
They'll argue, for example, that it's ridiculous for an interviewer to expect you to write perfect code on a whiteboard,1
Well, yes, it is,1
But, generally speaking, a single bug does not lead to a rejection,1
(And if it does, then that company's implementation is very broken, but that doesn't mean that the process as a whole is broken.)I think many people's objections (or ultimate conclusions) are misinformed or just poorly thought through, but I'm not particularly tired of people making them,1
Or, at least, I'm less tired of them than I am of objections on many other issues.Now, people misspelling my name on the other hand..,1
sigh.,1
 You dont ask someone to be your friend,1
So why do you ask them to be your mentor?Think about your closest friends  or even your less close friends,1
When you asked them to be your friend, what were your terms? How often would you hang out? What would you do? What would the expectations be on each side? Oh,1
You didnt do any of that,1
You didnt ask them to be your friend,1
That would be weird,1
Plus, how would they know if they like you before they know you? Its a sort of ridiculous question to ask or answer.But somehow or other, you just became friends,1
Maybe you just fell into friendship by hanging around each other enough,1
Maybe there was something specific that connected you, like having children the same age,1
Maybe someone introduced you two because you just moved to their city,1
Somehow or other, nothingness evolved into friendship.Like friendships, mentorships  the ones that actually exist, not the ones that exist in name only  rarely start from a formal request, and certainly not from a near stranger,1
It doesnt work for mostly the same reasons,1
Its artificially trying to create a personal relationship,1
Doesnt work.Moreover, with many mentorship requests (especially those between strangers), the more junior person is often not actually committed to making it work,1
If youve never sought out my advice before, why do you think youre now going to want to regularly get it? More likely, you suddenly thought Know what I could use? A mentor,1
Your interest will likely wane.Lets be honest: neither of us are likely to follow through with this mentorship, even if we both intend to.A pretty typical mentorship request:How to Get a Mentor Without Asking for a MentorIf you want someone to be your mentor, dont ask them to be your mentor,1
Let it build (or collapse) authentically.That doesnt mean you cant seek out mentorships,1
You can, just like you can friendships,1
Theyre not all that different,1
Both are fundamentally personal relationships, even if one is forged over drinks and gossip and another over coffee and advice.To establish a mentorship: Make yourself not a stranger,1
I recognize the names of people who regularly comment on my Quora posts, who re-share my Facebook posts, and who re-tweet my tweets,1
If I feel like youre not just a total stranger, Im more likely to help you.Write well,1
No text speak or sloppy punctuation,1
I can absolutely forgive grammatical mistakes caused by being a non-native English speaker,1
But if youre adding spaces before periods or not capitalizing words (or Capitalizing random Words), thats just being lazy and unprofessional,1
If youre lazy and unprofessional, Im unlikely to try to help you professionally,1
Why bother, if youre not doing what you can to help yourself?Get to know them -- in person,1
An online connection just isnt the same,1
Make it really, really easy for the other person,1
Find out where they work or live and meet them nearby,1
Offer to buy them coffee; its not about the money,1
Its about establishing that you value their time.Be persistent  but only a little,1
I get a lot of emails and, much as I wish this werent the case, I dont respond to all of them,1
If this relationship matters to you, follow up,1
For the most part, I dont refuse to respond to emails,1
I just havent yet gotten around to yours yet (and I might never).Make them like you,1
If possible, do something for them,1
The vast majority of mentorship requests I get are from people who have read one or more of my books but havent posted a review on Amazon,1
Look, Im an author,1
Reviews are a big deal,1
If you tell me you love my book and youre asking for help from me, Im likely to think, If you love it so much, why not post a review? I recognize Im being a little unfair here  the prospective mentee probably hasnt really thought about posting a review,1
But, still, Im a lot more likely to help those who I feel are willing to help me,1
Ill feel a bit indebted to you, Im more likely to help you,1
In fact, if I even see signs that youre generally a nice and helpful person to other people, Im more likely to help you,1
I prefer to help nice people.If I know you (even a little), if I feel like youre trying to help yourself, if I feel youre a nice person, and especially if I feel a little obligated, Im a lot more likely to chat with you  especially if you make it really easy for me,1
We can see where things go from there,1
We dont need to establish terms and conditions, so please dont ask me to be your mentor.,1
 I got a 750 (out of 800),1
This is 98th percentile overall, but it's only a little above average for MBA programs like Wharton, Stanford, and Harvard,1
All three have means and medians around 720 - 730 (around 95th percentile).As I recall, I studied for two or three weeks using the booklets from Veritas Prep,1
Those are great -- definitely recommend them.I took some practice tests by hand,1
I did not take any computer adaptive tests as practice, which was a mistake,1
Some advice/comments for those preparing for the GMAT:I loved the Veritas books,1
My understanding is that they're targeted at people who are already scoring fairly well, whereas the other books are more broadly applicable.I didn't take a prep class, so I can't really speak from personal experience,1
My understanding is that they're great for people who have trouble forcing themselves to study,1
But if you are self-motivated enough to study, they aren't that useful.Take at least one computer adaptive test,1
I had never taken a computer adaptive before the real GMAT, and it threw me off a bit,1
The questions get harder the better you're doing, so you end up feeling like you're doing worse.Take the GMAT well in advance,1
I took it last minute, so it was my only shot (and fortunately I did well enough that it wouldn't hurt me, although it also wouldn't really help me),1
If you give yourself more time, you have the opportunity to retake it,1
I believe you can "hold on" to your score for up to five years, so you might want to consider taking it after you finish college or between jobs,1
This will offer you more time to study.Also: if you're applying to the top schools, don't get too hung up on your score,1
Focus on getting in the right range, but beyond that it doesn't matter that much,1
It's just one very small piece of the package,1
Your work and other experiences matter far more.,1
 Yes,1
This is pretty standard practice -- not just for interviews, but for any sort of meeting,1
The meeting is only truly scheduled when both parties agree to that specific time,1
When you give a range of times that you're available, they cannot reasonably expect you to keep the entire range open,1
By the time they respond, some of your availability might have changed,1
Therefore, they need you to reconfirm that this time works.We do the same thing socially:Alex: "Hey, want to grab dinner sometime next week? I'm free Monday, Tuesday and Thursday." Alex has no particular obligation to keep those nights open, but it's nice if Alex can.Pat: "Sure, Monday works."Pat is expected to hold Monday for dinner with Alex -- for a short period of time, until Alex confirms (or not).Alex: "Great, see you then!"Both Pat and Alex are expected to hold Monday for dinner.The event is only really scheduled once Alex has also confirmed,1
Before then, Pat is somewhat in limbo.Additionally, if Pat specifically asks for a confirmation ("Sure, is Monday good?") then it's definitely expected that Alex would need to confirm,1
This isn't redundant,1
It typically doesn't change the situation (since hopefully you are still free at that time), but it does often enough that it serves an important function.,1
 Marissa Mayer doesn't and shouldn't have to set a good example,1
But to the extent that she inadvertently does, she actually sets a wonderful example for women by choosing to take only limited leave,1
She sends a message that not all women are the same, and that babies aren't just the women's responsibility.Different Input, Different OutputSee, the thing with a choice like how much leave to take: it's a personal choice that every mother needs to make for herself,1
A mother's choice will take into account things like:her careerher financial situationher partner's careerher desire to care for newbornsher ability to hire or get helpher partner's parental leave breastfeeding decisionsher healthher baby's healthother children at homeTo impose one person's decision on another person's, when any or all of these factors are different, is not just unfair; it's illogical,1
Different input leads to different output.It's particularly illogical to generalize from Marissa Mayer to all women,1
She very likely has round the clock help just for the baby, plus additional help for other household things,1
She makes a lot of money and she's in a particularly important role,1
It's ridiculous to act like her decisions reflect anything about the expectations for, say, the typical female software developer who works for her.A Great ExampleIf you do decide to inappropriately hold her up as some sort of example for "all women", then she's actually setting a great example,1
What's important for women, for the tech industry, and for the country is sending a message that everyone is different.As a woman -- in tech -- with a young kid and another one on the way, I can say that the expectation is definitely not "oh, you must go back to work ASAP." That's the expectation on fathers.We don't need another woman sending a message that it's okay to not work, permanently or for an extended period of time,1
That's already the norm (at least within highly paid jobs),1
Society has that message, loud and clear.What the US needs to learn (again, in highly paid jobs) is that you can't generalize all women and that, yes, some women can and will go back to work immediately,1
And that choice is okay.I'm pregnant, self-employed and have several consulting clients right now,1
They assume that I'm not really going to be working for a while after I have my child,1
Of course they don't ask -- it's often seen as a no-no topic in the US -- so there's just this lingering assumption until I awkwardly bring it up,1
And that sucks, frankly.By Marissa Mayer taking limited leave, she helps clear the way for people like me who choose to make a similar choice,1
She makes my clients question their assumption that of course I'll take months off,1
That's a great thing because, you know, we're all different,1
And that's okay.Babies: Not Just for Women Anymore!Even the fact that we're asking this suggests an issue with US culture,1
How many male CEOs have had kids? Where is the "controversy" around their not taking much leave?People don't ask because it's assumed that the babies are the mom's responsibility,1
It's okay for the dad to not take much time off because, hey, he's not really that important, is he? The mom, on the other hand: the babies are for her,1
They're her responsibility, right?That's the message that's being sent when we create a "controversy" from her personal decisions, and that's horrendously unfair to both mothers and fathers,1
We need to stop denigrating the role of fathers in society and we need to stop assuming that the woman is the "primary" parent.Anyone can be the "primary" parent -- or they can even be equals!But at the end of the day, it's her choice.Ultimately, regardless of what "message" she sends, it's unfair to expect her to make a choice that is not right for her,1
It's her choice, and it's important that we respect that,1
Women (and minorities) need to have the freedom to make their own choices without being "an example" -- the same freedom we grant to straight, white males.,1
 As much as people are dismissing this question as obvious, it's actually more complicated -- or at least ambiguous.1,1
What do you want to mean by saying that you're, say, two months pregnant? I feel like that should reflect "I got pregnant two months ago." However, one could also count from the start of your last period, which is how the number of weeks counts.2,1
How many weeks are in a month? A lot of people say 4, but this isn't true,1
An average month has 4.35 weeks (365 days / 12 months per year / 7 days per week.With those two definitions agreed upon, this will compute the number of months: # months = (# weeks - 2) / 4.35.Therefore, 34 weeks is 7.36 months pregnant,1
A different set of assumption could also lead to different answers, such as:7.8 months (if pregnancy starts from the start of the last cycle and there are 4.35 weeks per month)8.5 months (if pregnancy starts from the start of the last cycle and there are 4 weeks per month)8 months (if pregnancy starts from conception and there are 4 weeks per month)Some people might even add a month to each of those, as they might not distinguish between "in the 8th month" and "8 months pregnant".Again, it's really a matter of definitions,1
The 7.36 answer corresponds most directly to how months since you got pregnant, which is logical to me,1
Some of the others lead to weird things, like saying you're 10 months pregnant on your due date.,1
 That's an interesting question.First, I'm not so sure that it's true that most adults are unvaccinated,1
Vaccination isn't a binary thing,1
An adult might have some shots but not all,1
By contrast, a kid whose parents won't vaccinate on principle are likely to have no vaccinations,1
The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.Second, even if most adults overall are behind on shots, that doesn't mean the adults you know are that behind,1
The adults I know tend to be well-educated and have good access to healthcare,1
They're more likely to have had their shots -- but they still might be refusing the shots for their [perfectly healthy] children, under a mistaken belief that these vaccines are too much for typical child's immune system to handle,1
The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.Third, an adult with insufficient immunity might still have some immunity left,1
A child with insufficient immunity was probably never immunized at all, and thus has no immunity,1
The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.Fourth, kids have naturally weaker immune systems,1
They don't have the experience fighting off diseases that adults do,1
If a kid and an adult were both exposed to the same disease, the kid would be more likely to get sick,1
The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.Fifth, kids are little Petrie dishes of diseases,1
They roll around in dirt,1
They lick tables and other kids' toys,1
They touch sticky things just because they're lying on the ground,1
They'll pick up anyone's drink and drink from it, just because it's there,1
They don't have a good sense for "eww, gross!" (they might think plenty of things are gross, but it's more likely to be broccoli than the freshly chewed gum on the bench),1
And they're around other kids who are doing the same things,1
Kids are actually more likely to be exposed to diseases,1
Adults don't generally do this kind of thing,1
The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.So you see, there are a number of rational reasons to be more concerned about a not-fully-vaccinated child than a not-fully-vaccinated adult.It's also worth noting that vaccines are not 100% effective,1
Your vaccinated child also poses a health risk to the not-fully-vaccinated child, more so than your child does to the not-fully-vaccinated adult,1
Many people dismiss this under the rationale that they chose to not get vaccinated,1
But remember: the parent chose that, not the child,1
And even unvaccinated adults don't deserve to die.That said, although the unvaccinated child is more risky than the unvaccinated adult, I suspect there's a good amount of "we blame because we can." A parent who doesn't vaccinate their child (other than for rare medical reasons) is willfully introducing a health risk to their child and other children, without their consent,1
Yes, the risk is small when it's just isolated incidents of unvaccinated children, but it's a stupid risk to take anyway,1
It also becomes quite a major risk when a larger percent of the population is unvaccinated,1
People who don't vaccinate their children are an easy group to hate, judge, and fear,1
So while unvaccinated children are riskier than unvaccinated adults, some of the "stay away from them" mentality is probably motivated by the aforementioned inclination to hate, judge and fear them.,1
 The short answer is yes.In any question of the sort "do I have to know __?", there's a trade off between:How often does it come up?How hard is it to derive it if you don't know it?How hard is it to learn it?How much of a perfectionist do you want to be?Tries are pretty easy to learn,1
If you understand trees, I could teach you the essentials of a trie in under two minutes.They also come up fairly frequently,1
The odds of you using a trie in your interview is under 50%, but it's not negligible at all.I think it's worth it to learn,1
You probably spent more time writing this question and reading my answer than it would take you to learn the basics of tries.,1
 Some celebrities are more "mockable" than others, and their costumes reflect this,1
This doesn't mean that the celebrity deserves the mocking; it just means that they have something that others like to mock.A costume of George W,1
Bush is generally there to mock him,1
People aren't dressing as him out of respect and admiration,1
They're trying to be funny,1
The costume-wearer will likely be trotting out some of his dumbest quotes.By contrast, a costume of Michael Phelps is not necessarily a "funny" costume,1
It certainly can be (particularly if the person pretends to be smoking pot), but it's very often not.Which camp does Caitlyn Jenner fall into? Will her costume be worn out of respect (or just to make a cool costume) or for the lolz? There are certainly a great number of people who respect her, either for her bravery in coming out or for her athletic accomplishments (or both),1
There are lots of others who think she's disgusting and a sin against nature, or something like that,1
And there are even more who don't really think much about her as a person, so much as a joke.I would strongly suspect that those wearing her costume will be doing it because it's funny,1
What's so funny (to them)? That she's transgender,1
That's what people are, in most or all cases, making fun of when they dress as her,1
Making fun of someone who is transgender for being transgender is offensive and hurtful to many people,1
And from the looks of it, the people who are selling the costume know this,1
They picked a man to wear the costume -- and a particularly "macho" man,1
HILARIOUS, right?That's not to say that a custom of a transgender celebrity couldn't exist respectfully -- or even non-offensively but still not "respectful",1
If we lived in a time where being transgender wasn't a "funny" thing, but just a thing, then absolutely (and we probably will live in this time),1
Or, if there were a transgender celebrity who just happened to be accepted for this but mocked for something else, then you could have a "funny" costume of him/her that wasn't inherently transphobic.Unfortunately, Caitlyn Jenner doesn't fall into this category,1
She's most strongly associated with being transgender, and she's being mocked for this,1
That's what's inspiring this costume,1
Therefore, it is innately offensive.,1
 I have a very unique first name (and, for my first name, a fairly unique spelling),1
To some of the older Quorans, it might seem fairly mainstream,1
It's not -- at least not anymore.From Everyone has a name: In 2014, there were just 7 Gayle's born and only 13 Gail's,1
Interestingly, Abigail is extremely popular -- it's the 8th most common name,1
Still, people just don't like Gayle/Gail.Fine by me,1
I've really liked having an unusual name,1
I find that it helps my career in that I can more easily brand myself,1
It's not just that search engines can more easily find me and I can get the usernames I want, although that's definitely handy,1
It's also that "Gayle" is sufficiently descriptive to point to me,1
If you're in tech and you hear someone talking about someone named Gayle, it's very likely me (or likely enough that you might ask, if you knew me),1
This would not be true if my name were, say, Sarah.For this reason, I prefer to a more unique name (although with easier spellings) for my children,1
Unfortunately, it comes with the downside of less anonymity, if that's the path one choose,1
Ah, well.If you're really concerned with anonymity, you can look for names that are unique but still have an obvious nickname that's common,1
This way your child can choose to go by this nickname if he/she doesn't like having a unique name,1
For example:Wilson is fairly unique, but your child could go by Will.Johnson is unique, but your child could go by John.Jennette is unique, but your child could go by Jen.Aliana is unique, but your child could go by Ali.Names like this offer "brandability" as the default, but the option of anonymity.,1
 For our son's first birthday, we did a book-themed party,1
We enclosed a note inside the invitation saying:There's one small requestThat won't be too hardPlease bring a book Instead of a cardWhether Cat in the Hator Winnie the PoohYou can sign the bookwith a sweet note from youA few people brought gifts as well (or instead), but most people just brought a book.I don't think anyone thought it was rude,1
It made sense, given the book theme,1
And it probably made things easier for people as they didn't have to look for an appropriate toy.,1
 I don't know how many babies were negatively affected by it,1
The number is probably a lot higher than 17, but a lot lower than other countries (as it wasn't approved in the U.S.).The articles I've read have hedged a little on the number,1
They'll usually say that only 17 babies were shown to be impacted, which is different than saying only 17 babies were impacted.Note that health and other statistics are typically difficult to compare across countries, as the methodology for reporting and labeling is different,1
A country with mandatory reporting may have a much statistic, but that doesn't mean the true number is higher,1
Additionally, some countries might be much less likely to link an outcome with a specific cause, whereas others might be pretty comfortable in saying "mom took drug, baby is deformed, therefore, drug caused deformity.",1
 You're hanging out at home and your buddy is in the other room,1
You ask him to bring you a cup of water.He walks back into the room with one of the following:Nothing at all: this is the null array.An empty cup: this is the empty list case.A cup with water: this is the non-empty list case.Now, case 1 and 2 might feel the same to you (no water for you!), but logically, they are different,1
An empty cup is obviously not the same thing as no cup at all,1
They just aren't,1
One is a cup,1
One is not.The fact that he brought you an empty cup might signal something different than nothing at all,1
For example, it might signal that he heard you but you didn't have any water.Depending on what you wanted to do with the water, it might have a very different result,1
If you wanted to, say, add a drop of red food coloring to the water to make red water, in one case the drop lands on the table and makes a giant mess, and in the other case it lands in a cup.This is the difference between an empty list and no list at all,1
In some cases it might have the same implications, but in other cases it does not.,1
 Many people do tell friends and family their name choice at first -- and then they learn their lesson,1
Revealing the name in advance can only hurt them,1
I generally avoid doing things that will only hurt me and won't help me; don't you?Look, if I tell you my favorite name, one of a few things will happen:You'll tell me that you love the name,1
Whew! But nothing's changed now,1
I don't really like the name any more than I did before, nor have you influenced me,1
I'm glad that you like it, but this wasn't really a value-add exchange of information.You'll tell me that it's too {common, unusual, hard to spell, easily confused with another name, black, WASPy, hispanic, old-fashioned, trendy},1
Um, okay..,1
so you don't like my name choice because it's unusual, but that's part of why I like it,1
Again, no value-add, but it was value-subtract,1
Now I know you don't like the name.You'll tell me that you don't like it because that one jerk you know has the same name,1
That is obviously meaningless in terms of the general quality of the name, but it's still a value-subtract,1
Now I know you don't like the name.In other words, your opinion is basically worthless,1
Your criteria are either stupid or different than mine,1
So let's review,1
If I tell you the name I've picked, I walk into one of two scenarios:Best case: no change / mild relief,1
Worst case: walking around with the knowledge that you don't like my baby's name -- and possibly even turning me off the name enough that I need to choose a new name.It's a no-brainer: Keep the name a secret,1
Only tell those you know will happily lie about how much they like the name.After the baby is born, people are considerably more tactful because, hey, what's done is done,1
They realize it's harmful to say they don't like the name,1
So they stay quiet and, often, eventually come to like the name.Note: If someone tells you their name picks, the correct response is "I love it!",1
 I've helped coach a number of teams through the Google acquisition process (as well as many other companies),1
It is quite common to require these interviews,1
It depends on whether it's a talent acquisition (acquihire) or a product/user acquisition,1
The closer it is to a talent acquisition the more likely that Google will interview the team as part of the "technical due diligence" process.This actually makes quite a bit of sense,1
If they're acquiring your company as a way to get engineers, doesn't it make sense that they'd want to assess the quality of those engineers in the same way they hire their own?Employees who underperform in these interviews are not brought on as part of the acquisition ("fired" as you might say, but it's not truly being fired),1
If too many people do poorly, the acquisition just won't happen at all.,1
 An "unlimited" (within the first year) parental leave policy might not be as good as it sounds.It's understandable that people are excited about this,1
It seems like a good thing,1
It's equal across mothers and fathers; that sends a nice message that babies are not just the woman's responsibility,1
I think all parental leave should be equal,1
The flexibility offered through it is nice as well, since not every parent wants to leave full-time.However, I'm deeply concerned about how it will actually play out.From what I've heard, when companies offer "unlimited" vacation or sick leave, employees actually take less time off,1
The reasoning is that the time isn't considered yours, free to spend as you see fit,1
You also now have to worry about how you're perceived,1
Will taking X weeks off be considered excessive?Facebook, for example, offers four months fully paid to both men and women,1
That's very generous (by US standards, especially for fathers) and it's equal,1
Men and women both know that four months off is absolutely reasonable in the company's eyes.Netflix didn't state their policy as one-year of parental leave,1
No,1
That would be quite different (and very admirable).They say it's "unlimited" (within the first year),1
Now parents need to worry about what's truly acceptable,1
One year might be normal in other countries (where, notably, leave is typically paid for by the government and not by company), but it's not normal in the US,1
You probably won't see a lot of people taking one year just because they can, just as you probably don't see people at Netflix taking three month vacations under their "unlimited vacation" policy.People have to figure out what's acceptable, and that might well mean erring towards the more limited six-week leaves that other companies offer.And, what's worse, this might impact men more than women,1
Many people (erroneously) don't feel like men "need" much leave, so men might feel expected to come back to work earlier.Netflix's intention was likely quite good, especially as this is inline with how they offer vacation and sick leave,1
However, the actual impact might be quite bad.It'd be far more powerful if they had explained the policy as one-year of leave, for men and women,1
That's technically the same thing, but sends a very different message.,1
 A lot of people value uniqueness in a name,1
There can be several reasons for this, including:Emotional: My kid is so special that I want him/her to have a special name,1
He/she shouldn't be just like all the other kids.Practical: It's annoying to be one of five Johns in your class,1
Many parents don't want to put their kids through that,1
Strategic: Some believe it's beneficial for your career to have a unique name,1
It's believed (by them) to be easier to make a name for yourself if your name is actually unique.Many are relating to their own experiences in this,1
For my kids, I prefer names that are unique but easy to say and spell,1
Why? Because I like that my name is very unique, but the unique spelling is annoying,1
So that's what I pick names based on,1
I want a name that's uncommon enough that he'd rarely meet anyone with that name, but still easy to spell and sounds like a normal name.Interestingly, if you listen to what people complain about with these "unique" names, it's often not about uniqueness or spelling or even newness.Uniqueness: Nevaeh was the 65th most common name, and it's was as high as 25 a few years ago,1
(A comparison point: in 1985, the 65th most common name was Catherine, with Cynthia at #66.)Spelling: Precious is very easy to spell,1
So is Apple.Newness: Hudson doesn't get nearly so much hate,1
And yet, it's quite a new name and very "trendy."Know what name is unique and hard to spell? Gayle,1
There were just 7 Gayle's born in 2014 in the US (and 13 Gail's),1
You think that's a ridiculous name too, right? Oh,1
You don't,1
(You probably just think it's old sounding.)So, what is the real objection here? Why do these names seem weird? Because:You're not a baby,1
They were weird 20+ years ago, but that doesn't mean they're weird now,1
The names just seem so..,1
black,1
Very often, the names that people complain about are ones that are associated with black people,1
Names with equivalent popularity/trends that aren't "black names" don't get nearly as much hatred,1
(You might not have been consciously thinking this -- I doubt you were,1
But I'll bet if you presented people with two equally popular names and with equal trends, one that sounds "black" and one that sounds "WASPy", they'll much prefer the WASPy one.)To summarize: Many people value uniqueness in a name, for a variety of justifiable (and some silly) reasons,1
Others look down on those choices, especially when it doesn't match their age/racial culture.,1
 No.There are many reasons why unplanned pregnancies happen,1
Lack of access to contraception.Contraception failing.Rape and/or abuse.Being told that you're infertile.Using contraception incorrectly.In addition, there are reasons why someone might want an abortion, even in a planned pregnancy (for example, fetal and maternal issues).These things happen, but let's be honest,1
The number one reason for an unplanned pregnancy that leads to an abortion is just people being irresponsible by not using contraception and then deciding they don't want kids.Should they be able to access abortions, despite their stupidity? Why on earth not?Pregnancy is hard -- really hard,1
It sucks even when you want to have a kid, and I can't imagine how much worse it'd be if you don't want to,1
Raising a child (or giving up a child up for adoption) is even harder,1
These are not reasonable "punishments" for a couple's irresponsibility,1
I don't want to force a woman to go through pregnancy and then adoption/child-raising just because she was irresponsible.In fact, do you really want the woman who was repeatedly irresponsible and doesn't want a baby to be forced to raise a child?,1
 While I understand where you're coming from, no, it's not re-writing history,1
In fact, it'd be frankly weird to not update the pronouns,1
This is essentially how we handle everything else,1
People say "Gayle McDowell worked at Google",1
But McDowell is my married name, and I was "Gayle Laakmann" the entire time I was at Google.Someone might say "I met my husband at my friend's 25th birthday party," but at the time he wasn't her/his husband,1
Names and pronouns are just "pointers" to the person,1
They typically reflect the current name and pronoun, not the name or pronoun at the time,1
I am not inherently Gayle McDowell; I am me and people happen to refer to me as Gayle McDowell.Convention is to use the current pointer, not the then-pointer (probably because the pointer is designed to be useful, and using an out-of-date one isn't so useful),1
It'd be quite strange to break from convention specifically to use a transgender person's "original" sex.Additionally, for many transgender people, their original name/pronoun reflects a painful time in their life,1
They might not want to be reminding of this time themselves,1
They might also not want to "out" themselves to others.Given that convention is to use the original pointer and the pain it would cause to not, it seems pretty evident that we should use the current pronoun.Of course, if a specific transgender person has a different preference, go with that,1
Even if it doesn't fit the "standard." This impacts them far more than you.,1
 Obviously I applied topological sort to a graph of the dependencies across sections and chapters.First, there was the decision about which chapters and sections to include,1
Second, I had to draw a directed graph and connected nodes where one should be discussed before the other, either due to a dependency in the material or a difference in complexity,1
Third, I applied a simple topological sort to determine a linear ordering,1
There's some randomness to it too.Sections"Introductory Material" obviously needs to be before anything else."Solutions" obviously needs to be after the questions themselves,1
"Data Structures" needs to be before "Algorithms", since they're less complex and the algorithm questions often depend on knowledge of data structures."Assorted Review Problems" needs to be after all the other questions.So you get this graph for the sections:Applying a topological sort to this, you get the order in the book.ChaptersWithin Data Structures, "Arrays" needs to be before anything else, as it's the most fundamental,1
It makes sense to me to discuss linked lists before stacks and queues or trees, since linked lists are more basic than either of those.Within "Algorithms", there isn't a lot of dependency,1
"Recursion and Dynamic Programming" should be before "Sorting", since sorting uses recursion.Within "Knowledge Based", C++ and Java should be discussed adjacent to each other and before Databases.Within "Assorted Review Problems", moderate problems should obviously be discussed before hard problems.So then I just applied a straightforward topological sort to get a linear ordering.I presume this is the standard algorithm for all authors to decide chapter ordering..,1
right?Okay, fine, I didn't really draw this out,1
But something like this was roughly in my head,1
Certain topics were dependent on others, and certain topics were just less complex and should be discussed earlier,1
A lot of chapters, especially within algorithms, could be discussed in any order.,1
 Talk to him/her as much as possible,1
Don't use baby words unless you want him to learn baby words.Point out some simple objects: ball, mama, dada, etc.Listen carefully to what they say,1
They may be speaking in their own language,1
My son calls buses "ma" (no one knows why),1
It's not a real word, but it's his word,1
It counts! You don't need to use their makeup words with them, but you should respond as though they're saying the real thing.When they start being able to speak a bit, avoid yes/no questions ("Do you want to read a book?") and use either/or questions instead ("Do you want to play with the car or the spoon?"),1
This forces them to speak a little more while pushing their limits a bit.Push two word phrases,1
Teach them "more" and then "food." Once they have those, encourage them to put the two together to say "more food." Play dumb a bit, like you don't know what they want more of,1
As they develop their language skills, continue to push their abilities a bit and play dumb,1
Make them need to use their words to get the things they want.,1
 If you actually performed poorly and your interviewer said that, he/she would be a jerk,1
It would be a bad sign, but mostly because you had an interview where you didn't do well and because you had an interviewer who was a jerk.But, honestly, I find it quite unlikely that your interviewer said this if you didn't do well,1
It's FAR more likely that in fact you only think you did poorly.See: Why Your Interview Performance is Impossible to Judge (More relevant for software engineering roles, but applicable regardless.)So, really, what you have is this question: Is it a good sign or a bad sign if your interviewer says "I hope the rest of your interviews go as well as this"? That indicates that you most likely did well and your interviewer really liked you,1
That's a great sign!,1
 The design is important to the extent that it affects the ability to easily grab the highlights and other essential content from your resume,1
Few recruiters would judge you (at least consciously) on the design of your resume, unless design skills are important for your job function.As far as the "CareerCup template": there's nothing special about it,1
It's just a boring, normal template,1
It's designed to be able to fit a good amount of content on it and to make it easy to see the key details (job titles, companies, etc),1
It was right for me,1
It might not be right for you.I dislike templates for me with my experience which use the entire left column to just have headlines like "EXPERIENCE" and "EDUCATION",1
Sure, it looks pretty,1
But it wastes so much space.I dislike templates for me with my experience which don't adequately highlight the company names,1
My resume highlight was company names,1
I needed reviewers to be able to skim my resume and say, "Wow, she worked at Microsoft and Apple,1
Let's interview her." Frankly, that's really all I needed to land any interview,1
That's probably not your situation though,1
If your company names actually reflect poorly on you, then you might want to hide your company names and instead highlight your job titles,1
Formatting like item below is harmful to me but potentially beneficial to you.Software Engineer, Company Name (City, ST), June 2010 - June 2015I don't care if a template includes the cities of each job,1
Many people needs this in their resume,1
I didn't.I don't want to highlight specific skills (languages, software, etc), but it does need to be on my resume somewhere.I wanted a one page resume,1
Short resumes help the highlights jump out,1
Long resumes end up with some great things pushed to the next page, or just lost in a bunch of other weaker items.So these were (some of) the criteria used to design this: This is what a GOOD resume should look likeIt's an okay template for many people, but there's nothing special about it,1
It's just a normal, boring template,1
It was designed to fit my needs,1
Those probably aren't the same as yours, but they might be close enough,1
Or not.The major thing you should ask it what the selling points of your experience is,1
Pick a few things that you think will be the keys to landing an interview,1
Is it a job title? A company you worked for? A project? An award? Your school? Pick a template that allows those to stand out on your resume.,1
 This will not pose an issue with Google or with the vast majority of tech companies in the U.S,1
In the U.S., the law is that a company cannot discriminate on the basis of physical disability if you would be able to perform the job with or without reasonable accommodation,1
(And the bar for "reasonable" goes pretty far.)I don't even see a reason to mention it to your recruiter,1
So you have to get up every 30 minutes? Most people get up and walk around periodically,1
No big deal.There's no accommodation they need to know of, so no reason to mention it.,1
 Maybe, maybe not.1,1
Is this a good question?I can't really comment on the problem as it's not clear what the problem means.Many people have interpreted the problem to mean flipping left and right,1
In this case, it's a pretty uninteresting trivial problem,1
It's a bad question, unless maybe early on in the process, because it doesn't really demonstrate much,1
It's easy,1
(And I would be somewhat concerned about someone who couldn't do it.)However, the OP later says that it was "to min-max a tree, ascending to descending",1
I don't really understand what this means,1
Max Howell on Twitter2,1
Was he rejected because of this question?It's also unclear why he was rejected,1
Was he specifically told that he was rejected because he couldn't invert a binary tree on the whiteboard? If he had multiple interviews (which is likely, since he was brought onsite), does he know that it was that interview that led to his rejection? If he did know it was that interview, how does he know why he was rejected? Usually recruiters don't provide that information.Perhaps it had nothing to do with his technical performance and was in fact his communication skills.In my experience, a candidate's assumptions about their performance has no correlation with their actual performance,1
He might have very strong beliefs about why he was rejected, but unless he was specifically told, I don't really put much faith in it.3,1
Why was he rejected?If it was his technical performance on this question that led to his rejection, it's still not quite true that he was rejected because he simply "can't invert a binary tree on a whiteboard."Interviews aren't graded on a binary basis,1
It's not like, "Oops, you can't do X, so I'm going to reject you."More accurately, if it was this interview question that led to his rejection, he was rejected because he performed worse on this question relative to other candidates,1
That is, other candidates who tackled the same problem with the same interviewer demonstrated stronger problem-solving/coding skills than he did,1
It's very much feasible to perform better than other candidates on this problem (whatever it is),1
He just didn't.4,1
Was he a false negative?Yes, the interview process is flawed,1
There are false positive (bad candidates who are accepted) and there are false negatives (good candidates who are rejected).Was he a false negative? We don't really know,1
Maybe,1
He's certainly done some excellent work, but that doesn't mean he would perform well in Google's environment,1
Just because you're great in one environment doesn't,1
 mean you'll perform well in all.5,1
Should you hire on past experience?You might argue that, despite poor performance (relative to other candidates), he should still be hired because of his prior experience,1
I'm somewhat sympathetic to that view, but it can also present a dangerous slippery slope,1
How widely do you start making exceptions because someone has great prior experience? How do you roll out such a policy at a large company without letting the bar slip to more marginal cases?It's worth noting that, in the vast majority of cases, you can't hire based on someone's prior experience,1
You can only hire based on how someone discusses it,1
It's hugely subjective and very coachable,1
In a "hire on prior experience" process:There are lots of false negatives because candidates don't know how to discuss their prior experience,1
There are lots of false positive because candidates are able to trump up (sometimes even lie) about what they've done in the past.There are lots of people who are brilliant and would do great work given the right opportunities and mentorship, but haven't gotten that opportunity yet,1
Google's process can identify those people,1
Many people don't classify those situations as a false negatives since those people haven't in fact accomplished much,1
I think that's a mistake,1
You care about what they'll do for you, not what they've done in the past.It's also circular logic, since it's saying that hiring based on prior experience justifies rejecting based on a lack of it,1
If so, then doesn't hiring based on whiteboard problem-solving skills justify rejecting based on lack of those?Hiring based on prior experience comes with its own set of issues (and its own advantages).6,1
Does it work for Google?As far as if it works for Google: well, let's look at it this way,1
Virtually every "elite" tech company (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Airbnb, Dropbox, Palantir, etc.) has built its team of software engineers through this process,1
Unless you're going to argue that a randomly selected group of programmers could have built systems like the ones at those companies, the interview process can't be that bad,1
Somehow, it's selecting reasonably good people, even if it rejects some good people and hires some bad ones (and even if there's a better way of doing it).This is not to say that Google's process is perfect,1
It's not,1
But all interview processes are broken in their own ways,1
The key is to find the one that's least broken for your company.Developer Interviews are Broken, and You Can't Fix It,1
 "Shameful"? Yikes!Even so: No, it won't be released on the same day,1
It's not really possible.The way that the book is printed in India is different from the US,1
In order to make the book affordable in India prices, I have to do bulk print runs,1
It takes time -- an unpredictable amount of time -- to get that ramped up,1
The printer also isn't quite as tightly integrated with Amazon and Flipkart (through no fault of theirs),1
That also causes a delay as books have to actually be shipped to a warehouse.By contrast, in the US, when I say "go", it's available that day or the next day.I suppose I could just arbitrarily hold up the US release until it's released in India, but that doesn't help anyone.,1
 I've definitely heard (frequently) of interviewers selecting questions from Cracking the Coding Interview.However, they shouldn't,1
When I do interviewing training, I specifically tell companies not to.First, questions in the book are there not because they're necessarily good questions, but because they're useful for candidates to prepare with,1
The correlation between is strong, but not perfect,1
For example, brainteasers are in the book even though I don't recommend asking them.Second, and much more importantly, it's stupid to ask questions from the same book that candidates are largely using,1
The point of problem-solving questions is to see how candidates solve new problems that they haven't seen before.,1
 I don't actually have control over that, interestingly,1
I set a list price on Amazon, but then Amazon can (and does) arbitrarily drop the price.The list price for the 5th edition is $39.95, but Amazon sells it for $30.05 (right now).The list price for the 6th edition (on pre-order right now) is $39.95, but Amazon has just dropped the price to $27.64,1
I don't have any control over this; it just happens.So in other words, the price could be anything from $21 to $40 at any given point,1
On pre-order though, the price is "guaranteed" in that you pay the lowest price as the price varies.Cracking the Coding Interview: Gayle McDowell: 9780984782857: Amazon.com: Books,1
 I typically vote as a democrat,1
More specifically:I lean much more strongly democrat on most social issues (gay rights, transgender rights, black and minority rights, women's rights, gun rights, healthcare, immigration, religious involvement in politics, assisted suicide, etc).I think the increasing disparity between the wealthy and poor is problematic,1
I'm concerned about the shrinking middle class,1
Democrats seem more focused on this issue,1
I somewhat side with republicans on some economic ideas (for example, the value of being fiscally conservative), but I don't think they have actually executed effectively on this.While democrats have elected their share of stupid people, Republicans seem to take the cake here,1
Their adherence to religion probably has something to do with it,1
(This is not at all saying that religious people are stupid,1
It's that screaming the loudest about God seems to be a winning strategy for Republicans,1
That's taking the focus off more important things, like good decision making.)To put this another way: I'm somewhat torn between the two sides,1
I could be willing to go against my values and vote republican if there were very strong evidence that Republicans were better for the economy (after all, the economy also has life and death impact for people),1
But that evidence isn't there yet, and thus I would generally vote democrat.,1
 When I was in college, I TAd for a freshman/sophomore level computer science class,1
All the TAs were prior students in the class,1
We had by far the best set of TAs in the Computer Science department.Is that surprising? We surely had much less experience than the other TAs, who were usually PhD students,1
We didn't have the expertise in the subject area that the PhD students had.But here's the thing: We were great teachers,1
We were selected not because we were knowledgable in the material (although we had to of course do reasonably well in the class), but because we could effectively communicate it.They knew we could effectively communicate it because they'd just spent a year interacting with us and watching how we communicate,1
That's so much better than an interview.We'd just taken the class, so we knew what people struggled with,1
We could communicate it at their level because we were still at their level,1
We wouldn't try to explain things with concepts beyond their understanding.When a true subject-matter expert teaches something, he/she often communicates in a way that is too complex.You want your teachers to be great teachers, first and foremost,1
Experts absolutely have their role,1
You need an expert to set up the curriculum and to tackle some of the more difficult questions,1
But you don't need to be taught by experts at all times.I don't think it's that different at a coding bootcamp,1
You certainly want experts to be very involved,1
But prior students who really stood out in their communication skills could make excellent teachers,1
They can communicate the complex topics in a way that might just make more sense to a current student.,1
 I think what's disrespectful is to presume, with zero knowledge of the parent or child or situation, that we know better than them,1
Here's the entirety of our knowledge:Someone had a bumper sticker that said "Please be patient, autistic child on board."That's it,1
We presume that this was on a car,1
We presume that this was the parent,1
We presume that the kid doesn't want their condition known,1
We presume that the kid is able to even understand what this bumper sticker says,1
We presume that this was done with no reasonable justification,1
We presume that we know better although we know nearly nothing.Try this: When you see a parent doing something that you don't get, ask yourself, "Is there a plausible explanation for this behavior?"For pretty much anyone with kids, someone could look at a parenting choice and say that it's a bad one,1
Usually, when you know the situation though, it seems a lot more reasonable.Two examples from my personal experience:For much of my child's life, I've carefully tracked his calories,1
I don't give him food just because he asks for it,1
I ration food that many parents would consider fairly healthy (eggs, whole wheat bread, milk, fruit, etc).The parenting books say that you should let your kid eat whenever they're hungry and that those are healthy choices,1
Kids know how to control their appetite,1
Yes, that's true in most situations,1
Lots of people have told me that I don't need to worry so much about what my kid eats.But my kid will overeat into obesity and those foods, while healthy in many respects, are very high in calories.I have a friend who really pushes her kid to eat,1
She's practically force-feeding her kid,1
That's a big no-no in the parenting books,1
But her kid will, if left to his own, eat so little that he'll be unhealthily skinny and deprived of sufficient calories to grow healthy.We don't know what is going on in this situation, but I can certainly imagine situations where it'd be better to disclose this child's autism publicly than to not,1
Perhaps it makes other people more tolerant of the child's situation and less likely to do things that upset the child (honking, yelling, etc),1
Perhaps this parent tends to have trouble getting the child in and out of parking spots,1
Perhaps this is a vehicle used to transport severely autistic children and, again, they got a lot of hassle before putting this on.Remember that when you ask if a parent should do something, the question is about that parent, not all or even most parents,1
Most parents shouldn't ration food, but we should,1
Most parents shouldn't force-feed their kids, but my friend should,1
Most parents shouldn't use such a bumper sticker, but this parent -- if it even is a parent -- quite possibly should,1
The parent did this for a reason, remember,1
Why assume they're wrong when we know absolutely nothing?Give people the benefit of the doubt,1
Don't be so judgmental about other people's choices.,1
 Yes, it is in the works,1
It should be released June or July 2015,1
You can sign up to be notified (or just find out more details) at Cracking the Coding Interview, v6 | Coming SoonWhen I wrote the 5th edition about four years ago, I had a ton of interview experience but not as much coaching experience,1
Now, particularly through doing acquisition/acquihire coaching, I have a lot more,1
And, I have more experience with coaching the same people repeatedly,1
I have developed a bunch of new techniques and have been able to refine them by seeing what really works,1
This has motivated a lot of the changes.What's new?This is a huge expansion,1
You know that thing that many professors do, where they create a new "edition" that's not substantially different but forces you to buy a new version? I don't believe in doing that,1
This is actually a huge change (as was the 4th->5th edition).Some of the biggest changes:It's about 70% longer,1
The 5th edition was 500 pages,1
The 6th is (well, was) about 850,1
I actually hit the printing limit (800 pages), so I had to change the page size,1
(It's like college all over again...)It has 39 more problems,1
I took out a few problems I didn't really like, so there are probably more like 45 more problems.Hints! I'm really excited about this,1
I think this will be incredibly valuable,1
It will help you simulate the interview experience more and develop better techniques, since interviewers give you hints too,1
Each problem has an average of 5 or so hints (2 or 3 for some of the easiest problems), and more than 10 for some of the hardest,1
The hints for each problem are incremental,1
Try to solve the problems without the hints, but if you need them--use as few as possible,1
New strategies / techniques,1
I've done a lot of interview coaching over the past two or three years,1
There are a lot of trends and techniques that I see now that I never noticed before,1
They've even helped me to solve some of the harder problems,1
:)Lots of Big O,1
When I wrote the 5th edition, I don't think I realized how many people struggled with big O,1
Turns out..,1
the vast majority of candidates don't understand it well enough for an interview (even those who think they do),1
I have a huge section on big O now,1
In addition, many of the existing problems have been reworked or rewritten - fixing errors in some cases, clarifying things, adding new solutions/approaches, etc.Programming LanguageI have continued to use Java for this book for a few reasons,1
First, Java is more widely readable than Python,1
Pretty much everyone has written Java or a language much like it,1
Second, while I love Python as a language because it makes some things so easy (for example, doing a quick map or reduce), that makes solutions in Python a little less broadly applicable,1
I want this book to be as language agnostic as possible,1
The point is the algorithms, not the code.Third, for the purposes of this book, having explicit typing makes it easier for people to understand what's going on,1
It removes some of the ambiguity when reading written code,1
However, you can view or contribute solutions in other languages at gaylemcd/ctci.,1
 Your mom might not be going about it the right way (or maybe she is--we don't really know), but either way she has a point,1
I would encourage you to not brush it off entirely.Whether you like it or not, attractiveness makes your life easier,1
You'll make friends easier,1
People will think you're smarter,1
Teachers and strangers will like you more,1
You'll get treated better.These aren't just little things about how people see you,1
These are very real,1
Your friendships matter,1
Your grades matter,1
Your career matters,1
All of things come a bit easier when you're attractive and know how to put yourself together well.You're writing off caring about your appearance as superficial, but..,1
is all this superficial? Having friends? Grades? Career? Certainly many people go to excess here and care too much about their appearance,1
People can also care too much about their grades or too much about making friends,1
The fact that some people over focus isn't a reason to not care.What concerns me with your attitude is that you're just saying it doesn't matter to you, and I'm not sure you've thought through the implications of this,1
Additionally, given your age, there could be other factors at play,1
Perhaps you say you don't care about your appearance because you think it's hopeless,1
Or perhaps you think it takes too much effort,1
Or perhaps you don't want to enter into competition with your sisters,1
Or perhaps you want to feel superior over others and call them superficial.As I said, there's a lot of value in knowing how to put yourself together well,1
I would encourage you to find a way that works for you,1
Perhaps drop the sweatpants for stretchy skinny jeans (which can be much more comfortable, surprisingly, than normal jeans),1
Find some comfortable but fitted tops,1
Find makeup that works for your skin, even if you don't wear it everyday.If you do decide that you really don't want to care about your appearance, recognize what you're giving up,1
You're giving up something that will help you in many parts of life,1
It's okay to not leverage that advantage, just like it's okay to not leverage your network for a job search and it's okay to not work hard in school,1
You don't always have to take the "smart" path.Just make your decisions for you (not to spite anyone else) and with a full understanding of the consequences.,1
 Let's look at this from several aspects: correctness, readability, and style.CorrectnessIt's not actually technically correct,1
It's close and would only require minor tweaks to fix.First, you've implemented this extra little bit that isn't in the problem,1
If there's only one character of a particular type, you just insert that character (instead of the character + the frequency),1
That's actually not the assignment.Second, the problem requires that if the compressed string would be longer than the original string, you should return the original string,1
You haven't done this,1
This is the primary reason why the book's code is "longer": it's actually solving a different problem,1
If you strip this part out of the book's code, it's actually shorter and simpler than your code.If you make this change, there are two ways of doing it,1
You could check in advance (and save yourself the memory usage) or you can check after you've done the compression,1
You can debate which approach is better, and it depends on what assumptions you have,1
The book checks in advance, on the reasoning that if you really need to compress a string, then you potentially throwing long strings at it,1
It's nice to save yourself the memory usage.(Additionally, if your interviewer adds this constraint to the problem, then they may be looking for something beyond just throwing in an if-statement at the end.)ReadabilityYou've used nested loops where the inner loop modifies the outer loop,1
Yuck,1
It makes it look like you have an O(N^2) algorithm, even when you don't, and makes the flow of the program confusing.If you are going to do this, I'd actually rather you use not use "i" as the iterating variable on the loops,1
People usually use "i" when it's something very straightforward, like just looping through this,1
It has an implication of "ignore this variable -- it's not terribly important." Something like "index" would probably be better here.Avoid that when possible -- and it's definitely possible here,1
You can do this with just one linear loop forward,1
That's how the code in the book works.Style & other minor issuesFix your spacing,1
There should be a space after "for", "while", and "if".Be consistent,1
You can debate whether or not you should have spaces around comparisons (equals, less than, etc), although virtually every style guideline I'm aware of requires them,1
But if you really argue that you don't want them, then you should be consistent here,1
You have spaces sometimes, but not always ("i<input.length();").You declare the StringBuffer in the beginning, but then you have a (potential) return right after it,1
Why not just put the StringBuffer declaration after it?There's no reason to have the bulk of your code wrapped within an else statement,1
It's okay to do one-line if statements (actually, I don't love them, but I use them in the book for compactness), but don't mix a one-line if statement with a multiline else block.The first if-statement is actually,1
 totally unnecessary,1
I'd take it out.Given that you're using a StringBuffer, I don't see the benefit of concatenating a string first and then inserting the string,1
That will create a new string,1
I would just add the strings individually.Clean up time!First, I'll fix the style issues,1
I'm also going to put opening braces on the same line,1
This is my personal preference and the style that both Google and Facebook use,1
It's very much just personal preference; don't let anyone tell you it's bad to do otherwise,1

 It depends on how core that built-in library is to the essence of the question,1
Generally, you shouldn't replace the essence of the interview question with a built-in library,1
So writing array.sort() when I ask you to sort an array would be defeating the point of the problem (which is to see how elegant your code is).But, if your solution merely relied on the array being sorted but it wasn't really the point of the question, then please do use the built-in library.That said, it's sort of an irrelevant question,1
If you're approaching questions the right way, then this doesn't really come up as an issue.First, you should be discussing the problem with your interviewer before you start coding,1
You shouldn't just code as soon as you think you have a solution to the problem,1
This would be the point to mention that there's a built-in library that handles the problem.Second, when you code, you should approach it top-down, not bottom-up,1
Start with the most high level function and then fill in the details as you go,1
This ensures that you get the most important algorithmic parts done first,1
If you do things this way, it won't really matter whether or not you can use the built-in library functions,1
Use them--and make up your own functions as you need,1
You can fill in the details as you have time.,1
 No, certainly not.Let's make sure we're very clear on this point (because a lot of people don't really get this),1
The letter "n" is in O(n) is a variable that has a specific meaning,1
It's not a magic letter used for runtimes.An example: is inserting a value in a balanced binary search tree O(N) or O(log N)? Both are valid answers; it depends what N means.If N reflects the number of nodes in the tree, then insertion takes O(log N).If N reflects the depth of the tree, then insertion takes O(N).When someone something like "binary search in an array is O(log N)", they're being slightly imprecise,1
We all know that they mean that N is the size of the array (what else could it mean?), so we don't get too bothered by it,1
But technically, they should define the meaning of N.Given this, nested for loops are not necessarily O(N^2),1
Here are some examples:Example 1: O(A*W) and/or O(N)This code counts the number of a's in an array of words.1
2
3
4
5
6
array = array of words (where all words have the same length)count_of_As = 0for each word in array: for each character in word: if character == 'a': count_of_As += 1This is an O(A * W), where A is the length of the array and W is length of each word,1
You could, however, say it's O(N), where N is the number of characters in all the words, combined.You absolutely cannot say that it's O(N^2), because what would N mean? (Okay, there are some bizarre things you could define N to be,1
For example, if you defined N to be the square root of the number of characters in all the words,1
That'd be a very strange definition of N.)Example 2: O(N^4)This code builds a string of pairs of elements.1
2
3
4
5
6
array = array of charactersstr = ""for x in array: for y in array: pair_to_string = "(" + x + ", " + y + ")" str += pair_to_stringLots of people will want to say this is O(N^2), where N is the length of the array,1
Not so.Concatenating K characters together (naively, in most languages) actually takes O(K^2) time,1
A very simple explanation of this is that you're continuously creating a new string,1
The first time you create a string of size 1, then size 2, then size 3, then size 4,1
The total number of characters allocated O(K^2), which will take O(K^2) time.(I'm excluding times when the compiler might do some optimization, which is possible, or when the language does something fancier,1
This is a simple, naive example.)So if concatenating K characters together is K^2 time, then concatenating N^2 small strings together will be O((N^2)^2) time, or O(N^4),1
.Example 3: O(N)This code counts the number of sequences of 5 characters that are the same.1

array = array of intscount_product_occurrences = 0for x in array: for y in array: product = x * y if binary_search(array, product): count_product_occurrences += 1This code will take O(N^2 log N) time,1
That's because the for loops go through O(N^2) iterations, and each iteration does an O(log N) search.There are an infinite number of examples like this,1
Perhaps you feel like these examples are cheating or bending the rules of the question,1
Maybe..,1
if you define the question to be as follows: Are all nested for loops O(N^2) where:The outer for loop iterates O(N) timesThe inner for loop iterates O(N) times, for each iteration of the for loopThe outer for loop only does O(1) work, other than the inner for loopThe inner for loop only does O(1) work.In that case, yes, those should be all O(N^2),1
(Or at least, I can't think of any counter examples, but it's possible I'm missing some additional qualifications.)The important take-away here is to realize that nothing is ever inherently O(N) or O(N^2),1
N is just a variable and it always has a very specific meaning (although sometimes we infer what it is),1
Big O is just an equation of variables that reflects the runtime,1
That equation can be anything and can use any variables.In fact, if you're struggling even a little bit with big O (and even if you're not, this can't hurt): just stop using N as a variable in big O,1
Seriously,1
Use logical variable names instead that reflect their meaning.Too many people say "O(N)" when they really mean "linear",1
Well, linear in what? If you have an array of [equal-length] strings, it's really not clear whether your "N" refers to the array or the string length, or something else,1
Avoiding N as a variable name will prevent you from making a stupid mistake like this: Sorting a string takes O(N log N) time,1
So if you have an array of strings and you want to sort all of them, it takes O(N*N log N),1
Uh..,1
nope,1
Different Ns,1
Try again, using S for the string length and A for array length.,1
 As I understand it, the connection you're making is this: a boy being sexually abused and then turning out to be gay indicates that sexual orientation can be changed,1
Therefore, since it can be changed, we shouldn't oppose "gay conversion therapies."This is misguided on a number of levels.A data point of 1,1
Many boys being abused wind up being straight too,1
So finding out an abused boy is gay indicates nothing about how changeable sexual orientation is.Gay conversion therapy is opposed because it's harmful, not because it's ineffective,1
Gay conversation therapies aren't opposed because they're ineffective,1
Many things are ineffective yet don't earn the amount of hatred that conversion therapies do,1
Gay conversion therapy is despised because it's harmful and often done on a child without their consent, during a particularly vulnerable point in their life,1
We should oppose this even if it did sometimes work, or even if it could potentially works,1
Being gay isn't harmful.Additionally, it's worth noting that gay conversion therapy presumably -- hopefully -- doesn't operate via sexual abuse,1
Nor should it,1
So even if sexual abuse were found to "change" someone's sexual orientation, that doesn't mean that the current gay conversation therapy would work.Correlation doesn't imply causation.Let's suppose that there's a correlation between being sexually abused and being gay,1
Does this indicate anything about sexual orientation being changeable? No.Boys and girls realize they're gay at different times in life,1
Many report always knowing that they're "different", and some report knowing that they're gay from a young age (7ish in some cases),1
Being different makes kids feel vulnerable,1
Not just feel vulnerable, but be vulnerable,1
They're often isolated from their peers and scared of their friends and family finding out their secret,1
Child abusers are sickly drawn to this sort of vulnerability,1
If gay people are more likely to have been abused at a younger age, the causal direction is very likely the other way around.,1
 The way that Amazon works is that anyone can sell an item on there (not just the maker of the item),1
And, if it's your item that you physically own (or claim to own), then you can set whatever price you want.It's possible that someone owns a copy of the book and has decided to charge this amount for it,1
It is ludicrous? Of course,1
But that's their choice.More likely though, some computer algorithm has said, "Hey, this book is popular and hard to find -- I'll go charge X amount for it." The issue with computer algorithms is that the lack common sense,1
If you haven't specifically told them to account for some piece of information, then it won't just magically know to do it.In this case, what's happening is that the version of that book (the 4th edition) is no longer on sale, and it hasn't been on sale for nearly four years,1
The algorithm doesn't realize that it's not on sale because a newer, better version is,1
It doesn't realize that it should compare the price to that item and, if anything, be lower.The 5th edition is the latest edition and is a reasonable 530 rupees,1

 He should regret it,1
He should not have rescinded the offer publicly,1
In fact, nearly every part of this was wrong: objecting so strongly to the candidate's actions, actually rescinding the offer, and doing so publicly.1,1
He should not have rescinded the offer publicly.This is a private matter between the company and the candidate,1
It's not okay to disclose this publicly.2,1
He should not have actually rescinded the offer, when he could have just politely discouraged the candidate from joining.Instead of actually rescinding the offer, he could have gotten on the phone with the candidate and said something like this:I saw your post and you're still welcome here,1
However, I think you should join Uber instead,1
You want name brand, and they have that more so than us,1
The money differences are irrelevant in the long run,1
Don't make the decision based on that,1
It's so much more important to go somewhere you are excited to be,1
And if that's Uber, go for it,1
You can't go wrong.And so on.It probably would have worked,1
The candidate probably would have taken the Uber job,1
The CEO accomplishes the same thing, but now looks super mature, professional, and empathic,1
Right now, he basically looks like the opposite.If I'm wrong and the candidate joined Zenefits anyway, then isn't that what he wants?3,1
He should not have been so offended by the candidate's actions.So the candidate sees name brand as a "plus." Um, so? Who doesn't see that as a plus?If he thinks that most other candidates don't want the same thing, he's incredibly naive,1
This is especially true when hiring out of college,1
Of course they're going to think about long-term career options.I really don't see what's so offensive in this candidate's actions,1
He posted an anonymous question looking for career advice,1
Who cares? Nothing he said was even particularly negative about Zenefits.The Zenefits CEO made himself look like a jerk,1
I knew nothing about the Zenefits CEO prior to this, and I really don't think it's fair to generalize from a single action,1
But other people will,1
He looks naive: he's unaware that name brand is a factor in most people's decisions,1
There was nothing unique in this candidate's thought process.He looks immature and arrogant: he buys wholeheartedly into his mission, so he expects everyone else to -- even people who haven't joined.He looks like he's dodging responsibility: rather than accepting that he/his company might not have adequately sold the vision, he blames the candidate for not buying in sufficiently.He looks unempathetic: he's unable to look at it from the candidate's perspective and see that the candidate is being reasonable.He looks callous: revoking the offer, and doing so publicly, was mean.He looks unprofessional: there were much better ways of handling this situation, as I've explained here,1
Now, I'm not saying he is these things,1
I don't know much about him and I'm not going to generalize off of one incident,1
Maybe this is a weak point for him, or maybe this just caught him on a bad day,1
He's human too, and even CEOs of A-list startups make mistakes.But to people quicker to judge, he looks like all of these things,1
That's why this was such a stupid move.Also, can I just say..,1
when it's you vs the Uber CEO, and you are the one looking like a jerk, you know you screwed up.,1
 The question asks "Why are people showing support or sympathy for Salman Khan?", but most answers here instead seem to be giving reasons for not sympathizing with Salman, and not addressing why there is such a huge outpouring of sympathy for him,2
Inasmuch that he did something irresponsible that directly led to the death of a person and crippling of others, the court has found him guilty.However, sympathy isn't always rationally calculated after weighing all pros and cons and their expected utilities,2
It's typically a much more visceral reaction,2
Likewise, hatred or lack of sympathy is often almost equally visceral, and can be vicious and unreasoned,2
There are a lot of loosely independent sources which can give rise to sympathy or support for Salman Khan,2
Needless to say, this is said not in his defense, but is intended to be an attempt at analyzing why people behave the way they do.Let's look at some of them,2
Fan base: His fan base loves him, and like a lot of loyal fans, is sticking with him in times of distress,2
Its important to highlight here that Salman Khan has an exceptional fan following who fondly call him "bhai", the ultimate big brother; even the fandom SRK enjoys abroad pales in comparison,2
Thats the closest Bollywood gets to a Rajnikanth,2
His hard core fans are his extended family and so their sympathy is largely based on emotion and sentiment: the kind you would expect from your close friends and family (See Point 3).The nature of the crime: Many people (especially among those who are likely to read this answer) may find it easier to empathize and associate with Salman since, in the US v/s THEM dichotomy of lawful citizens and criminals, they would find it more natural to place Salman in the US group.In other words, while they will never imagine themselves in a situation where they would be in a place or time like a lower income group laborer who molests a girl, it is not difficult for them to imagine themselves in a situation like Salman's,2
People drink, and they often do utterly foolish and irresponsible things such as driving while drunk,2
After that, it's only a matter of a loose hand on the steering and a lot of bad luck, and you cause someone's death.Bollywood: The sympathy from Bollywood is largely expected,2
Some extremely tone-deaf and immature remarks from some Bollywood folks were indeed unexpected (you know which ones I am talking about), but barring those, the general sentiment is hardly surprising,2
He also appears to be generally large-hearted: tonnes of people have tweeted how he helped them out in times of need,2
You expect family members to support each other, so this reaction from Bollywood, which typically always sticks together as a fraternity, was not unexpected, especially in light of the other points which further help people rationalize the crime.Celebrityhood: Being a celebrity is a double-edged sword,2
At one end, the police officers and other people involved in this case have been living in hell because of pressure from all quarters,2
The story of the prime witness (who is now no more) is heart-rending to the say the least,2
On the other hand, a lot of people know, deep down, that if this were not a high profile case, it would probably never have gone even this far, was very likely to have been settled out of court, with the settled out of court part most likely being a euphemism.Like I mentioned above, sympathy is only loosely connected to lawfulness,2
A person who uses a legal loophole to rob an old widow of all her money and belongings and bring her to the streets may have 'technically' done nothing wrong, but is likely to get a lot of public hate,2
Likewise, being wrong does not preclude someone from getting sympathy.Prison sentences have to end up serving the dual role of keeping dangerous elements away from the society, and providing a disincentive for people by punishing them for breaking the law,2
Typically, these two often get treated differently by people,2
For instance, everyone seemed to sympathize with Ravindra Patil (the prime witness) when he said that he was put in prison with hard-core criminals for repeatedly failing to appear in court,2
All in all, the outpouring of support for Salman is not entirely unexpected,2
Whether it is unreasonable or not is a call I would leave for the reader to make,2
This answer is likely to be misconstrued and misinterpreted, so it bears repeating: it is intended not as a defense, but rather as an attempt at analyzing why people (have) behave(d) the way they do (did).(Thanks to Alankar for help with parts of the answer),2
 As a student, you would probably want to intern with multiple companies to get a wider range of experience and exposure,2
This might be helpful in making career choices later on, and at the very least would also broaden your network.Of course, this might change a bit based on other variables,2
At big companies like Google, one internship might be very different from another based on what teams you are on,2
Another potential scenario I can think of is if you are in a research internship and have developed a good relationship with your adviser,2
In this case, if returning helps you go deeper into the field and get good quality publications etc., you might want to return there especially if you are planning to apply to grad school.,2
 As others have written, while the term cottage cheese is commonly used to denote Paneer, there are slight differences in the way the two are made, and the ultimate difference from an end-product point of view is that paneer is pressed and comes out as a solid that can then be cut, while cottage cheese is wet and has loose curds which cannot be used the way paneer is used in Indian dishes,2
I've tried making palak paneer (paneer in a spinach gravy) using cottage cheese, and though I tried to strain the cheese, I still ended up with the cheese splitting and breaking down into tiny chunks and spreading all over the gravy.So what is the solution? Simple,2
Use the term Paneer and give people one of the following options: Tell them to buy paneer from an Indian storeIf an Indian store is not accessible, tell them how they can make a close approximation of paneer from cottage cheese, because if they use cottage cheese off the shelf in Indian paneer recipes, they will not get what they are aiming for.If they are particularly enthusiastic about it, tell them how to make paneer from scratch,2
It's not very tough, actually, and Youtube has tonnes of videos,2
Here's one by my favorite Youtube chef.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...English is a wonderful language that does not shy in absorbing foreign vocabulary,2
Let's add to the lexicon,2
:),2
 The short answer is that they do not,2
In specific, you should not think of the GRE as the JEE (or GATE) of the United States,2
Your JEE score is the sole decider of whether or not you get into IIT,2
On the other hand, the GRE is one of the many variables that are in consideration when deciding the fate of an application,2
The General GRE is also subject agnostic,2
It is NOT designed or intended to judge your competence in your major (there are Subject GREs for major-specific testing which are fairly technical and directly relevant),2
At its more general level, the GRE is for checking your general aptitude for graduate studies.For instance, while many people whine about the Analytical Ability (Verbal) section of the GRE, I think it is actually pretty useful,2
The expectation is that a person with Graduate level education (no matter what the field) has a fairly high amount of analytical and reasoning skills, along with the ability to correctly analyze texts, draw logical inferences, and express their thoughts in a cogent and cohesive manner,2
While it is true that this test hinges on one's English vocabulary, the vocabulary level of the GRE is actually pretty reasonable,2
Likewise, the Quantitative Aptitude section is a general gatekeeper section to ensure that everyone, even those from non-engineering, non-math backgrounds, have a basic level of quantitative ability.We can debate about whether or not the ETS is a giant scam, and whether or not the GRE should be required at all, of course, but don't assume that the GRE is the only thing that decides whether or not you get in.,2
 Most social niceties are a 'waste of time',2
But we extend them out of basic courtesy,2
The question then isn't about whether it is a waste of time, but whether the context needs you to ask that question.It is always about context,2
If you are in an office in America, and your colleague is German, you don't need to ask them if they know English,2
If you have been invited for dinner to a German family with whom you have not previously interacted, it might be nice to confirm that they are comfortable talking in English,2
If you are in Germany and are shopping in the market, you should probably not only definitely ask, but also ensure that you do it in an apologetic rather than demanding tone.,2
 So far, it looks unlikely that any language will replace English as the lingua franca in the foreseeable future,2
Imperialism is largely a thing of the past and we don't have large-scale wars anymore, and nothing is actively stemming the growth of English, and, in general, I don't see how any other language will rise to that position given the inertia that English has.English became dominant at a crucial time: the spread of globalism and the rise of digital technology and internet have more or less cemented this dominance,2
Many languages would have been considered to be so-called world languages at various points of time in history, but the first truly global language was and is English,2
I mean, no language even comes close,2
The only potential language that people keep touting is Mandarin, but I don't think it stands a chance either,2
Even if you were to discount for the extreme tall barrier that their writing system is, the fact is that none of the candidate languages have the kind of global traction that is needed for a language to become the lingua franca.,2
 When it comes to learning any language, there is nothing special about English,2
It needs the same kind of effort as learning other languages,2
The formula is usually straightforward: immersion and performance.Immersion: This is about how much exposure to that language the learner gets,2
In case of English, this is delightfully easy,2
We are surrounded by English content,2
Movies, radio, TV shows, songs, books, magazines, what not,2
No matter what your interest, you are sure to find English content in it,2
Encourage her to listen to and read English even if she doesn't understand all of it.Performance: Stimulus is one thing, but the next important thing is to actually use the language,2
All the time,2
Without worrying about being wrong,2
Encourage her to be adventurous and keep trying out new expressions,2
This is tougher for English because a lot of people already know it well and so there is this default expectation of competence, so she can begin with speaking English to a close group of people who can be expected to be supportive,2
One of your biggest enemies, if you are learning a language, is the existence of a viable alternative for communication,2
Even if you can talk to her in Hindi or Tamil, try to speak to her in English,2
You can speak a bit slowly if required, or explain stuff using different words,2
Encourage her, but also correct her as needed,2
Best of luck!,2
 My experience has largely been with scholarship/fellowship interviews, consulting interviews and CS coding interviews,2
At least in an interview setting, the tell me about yourself question is a pretty useful conversational starter and is often used by people to break the ice and make the interviewee comfortable,2
It is important that you dont get tensed up; instead, use this question to ramp up the interview,2
Jaime has talked about the kind of content you should have in your 'About Me',2
A few more pointers:Avoid rambling: Sometimes, when people haven't thought of what they want to say, they end up talking incoherently for a long time,2
You will bore the interviewer and likely make them disinterested,2
Do some homework on the kind of values the company has,2
It might be good to show them in your work to improve your cultural fit within the company,2
For scholarship interviews, it is useful if you can link stuff in your background with the values of the funding organization.If it is a general scholarship kind of interview where they are judging my overall profile, I like to end with my hobbies / other interests or whatever I like to do for fun,2
This helps me in two ways: It helps me end my monologue on a confident note, and it gives an easy anchor point that the interviewer can use to steer further discussionI think the ideal sweet spot is when your answer shows preparation (that you have thought about what you want to say), but doesn't look entirely rehearsed,2
In short, prepare a list of things you want to talk about, but dont memorize the answer word by word,2
Answers that sound rehearsed are a turn off, especially if you are applying for a job that relies on communication.,2
 I understand it would hurt to feel so disconnected with your son,2
While I cannot fix this directly, I'd try and help you with potential reasons why this might be so, and you could introspect a bit about whether they apply to you,2
Now, just to clarify, although I'd appear to be blindly favoring your college-going son, I am no apologist for our generation,2
I don't think we are blessed with exceptional intelligence or insightfar from that, we are winging it, like everyone else.I am going to talk about three things: Conflict, Autonomy and EscalationConflictMost people take the path of least resistance; they will tell you whatever lies you need to hear in order to minimize the conflict in everyone's life,2
What lies you get depends on what conflicts you mutually create,2
Sample this:Instance 1: (Son is out having dinner with his friends,2
His dad calls him)Dad: Kya kar raha hai? (What are you doing?)Son: Dinner karne aaya hoon baahar,2
(Ive stepped out for dinner)Dad: Jab dekho baahar ghoomta aur khata rahta hai,2
Mess hai na tere yahaan? (I see you going out all the time,2
You have messing facilities in the hostel, right?)Instance 2: (Son is out having dinner with his friends,2
His dad calls him)Parent: Kya kar raha hai? (What are you doing?)Son: Kuchh nahin, mess mein dinner kar raha hoon (Im having dinner in the mess)Parent: Yeh gaane ki aawaaz kahaan se aa rahi hai peechhe se (Why do I hear music in the background?)Son: Wo side mein lounge mein dance practice chal rahi hai..,2
(Erm, they have a dance practice session in the lounge)The truth is that you cannot realistically control every single living moment of your children's lives, especially not when they become adults themselves,2
So you have to resign yourself to the fact that they are going to do what they want to anyway,2
If you frequently express disapproval of their activities (in some cases, your disapproval may be justified, but that doesn't matter), they will probably just stop telling you about what they do,2
If it creates conflict or unnecessary headache or drama, it will be avoided,2
For instance, if your first reaction on hearing that your son has a girlfriend is one of anger (or worse: OMG! You have a girlfriend? No kissing! Get married soon!), you are pretty much guaranteeing that your son will never talk to you about his love life,2
Ultimately, unreasonable or excessive expectations are not going to be met with compliance,2
They are going to be met with defiance and deception,2
The question is, do you want them to live lives so secret that you don't even know them as persons any more, or do you want to actually be connected with who they really are? If you want to be a part of their lives, you'd have to relax a bit on trying to judge and control them.Note that this does not even need to be directed to your kid,2
If you make disapproving remarks about your neighbor's son getting a girlfriend, be assured your son is going to hide his from you,2
If, for instance, you made homophobic remarks while watching a movie or flipping through news channels reporting about 377, you can bask in the assurance that your gay son will never come out to you,2
Now, this is obviously not easy,2
After all, your values are not merely a fashion statement,2
You hold them because you, to a large extent, sincerely believe in them and subscribe to them,2
But every generation rebels,2
30 years ago, people might have prided themselves for having a 'love marriage',2
Many youngsters today take that to be the bare minimum.These differing versions of morality across,2
 generations aren't new, but it is possible that the chasm has widened due to the much more increased exposure that our generation gets,2
You will have to resign yourself to the fact that your kid may live a life vastly different from yours.AutonomyIf you made your child grow up with a lot of rules and restrictions, subjecting their lives to unnecessary or excessive scrutiny, there is a good chance that they will want to break free of it all at the first available opportunity,2
This is also why being overly protective is problematicyou are only creating a recipe for rash and irresponsible decision-making later, making them rush to make use of whatever autonomy they get, because they have been bottling up their frustration for so long,2
If you try to be too nosy or try to micro-manage their lives, they will initiate micro-rebellions,2
For instance, although they could tell you that they are going to Marine Drive with their friends, they'd choose NOT to, because that gives them a sense of self-control, of autonomy, and of not being constantly monitored or policed.Ironically, the more you try to be a helicopter parent of someone who is essentially an adult, the more likely you are to become distant from them,2
Someone I know had such helicopter parents,2
She worked in a different city, but they'd try to remote control everything she did, everywhere she went, and so on,2
Did it stop her from doing what she wanted? Obviously not, but it did encourage her to create an elaborate web of lies about her actions and movement,2
Whose gain was it? EscalationHow do you behave when your son does share something unpleasant with you? Do you go paranoid, or enter panic mode, or go just plain ballistic? If so, you are strongly disincentivizing him from sharing anything with you,2
There's a reason friends are often perfect for sharing your fears or worries or insecuritiesthey are sufficiently close to you without being so close as to take everything extremely personally,2
People share stuff for different reasons,2
Some just want someone to confide in who can process the information relatively calmly, not necessarily a problem solver,2
If you get emotional or teary eyed or livid at the shortest provocation, your kid will avoid telling you unpleasant stuff, as telling it increases the problems in his life rather than easing them.The 20s are a difficult time for all of this,2
People have to make the mental transition from needing their parents to potentially being needed by them,2
While school-going kids are taught to see parents as infallible authority figures, as captors who need to be defied, young adults have to slowly learn to see parents as more human, with their own hopes and aspirations, fears and insecurities,2
Between these two extremes is the territory most late teens and early 20s find themselves in, wherein they feel the need to assert their independence and gain footing in the world without being tethered to their parents.I don't intend to tell you that your kid is perfectly capable of taking all life decisions wisely,2
It is likely that he makes several bad decisions,2
But irrespective of whether he is or not, he is past the age where you can micro-manage his life,2
Just like the younger generation, you should also try and choose your battles, intervening only for stuff that merits intervention,2
(Hint: Haircut doesn't qualify)Needless to say, none of this is easy, and I'm obviously no expert, but I hope I did manage to shed some light on what you could potentially do to make it slightly less difficult.,2
 I mean, I can understand if we want more people to know about Sanskrit, but I don't get the obsession with wanting to revive it, or trying to shove it down people's throats,2
The sad part is that when it comes to nationalistic sentiments, we are faced with a perilous dichotomy:At one end, we have a breed of Indians who feel ashamed of showing any association with their cultural background,2
These are the kind for whom Yoga was uncool until the west appropriated it and made it fashionable,2
On the other end, you have those who credit everything from Cold Fusion to In-Vitro Fertilization to ancient Indian culture and spread half-truths and outright lies,2
And don't even get me started on the absolute nonsense that is generally spewed about Sanskrit, a language that deserves so much better.Both these extremes are ridiculous and untenable, and yet, these are the ones we keep encountering most often.Other answers have talked about making people feel proud of the past,2
Apparently Sanskrit is now charged with the gargantuan task of providing a nation of a motley group of 1 billion people a sense of common identity,2
Keeping aside the futility of the project, I'm pretty supportive of showcasing the laurels from our history, but with two giant caveats: correct messaging and intellectual accuracy and honesty.Correct messagingWhat is the undertone of the exposition? Usually I see outright racism or pointless chest-thumping,2
It is one thing to say, "Hey look at the cool stuff our ancestors did",2
It is another to say "My Daddy strongest! We were awesome, then foreigners came and now we are useless" or "North Korea, best Korea!"Accuracy and honestyFor every explanation of how the quadratic formula was derived by Indian mathematicians, we get 10 versions of how the Hanuman Chalisa proves that Hanuman jumped to the Sun because somehow distance * time = distance (I won't give links,2
If interested, feel free to Google "Hanuman Chalisa Yojan Proof" and you will get countless websites regurgitating this),2
For every explanation of how the Astadhyaayi cleverly encodes grammatical rules, we get 10 instances of "Sanskrit is the most beautiful, most unambiguous language in the world, Sanskrit sounds are a linear combination of all the sounds of the world".Until we fix these two, I don't want kids to be fed random trivia interspersed with lies and propaganda delivered with inimical messaging,2
[1] I am not using that term lightly,2
A lot of what is claimed about Sanskrit is nonsensical and cannot even be assigned a truth value.,2
 Beef is relatively uncommon at food places in India (restaurants, fast food joints etc),2
Popular joints such as McDonalds avoid controversy and maximize clientele by eschewing both beef and pork,2
However, you can find beef either at more upscale restaurants in cities like Mumbai or in hole-in-the-wall places in specific areas, such as in localities with a high concentration of Muslims (eg,2
Kurla),2
I imagine you could also find beef at touristy places with a generally high availability of Non-Vegetarian food (so Goa works, but Rajasthan won't).,2
 I thought about this myself when I first read Marina Keegan's thought-provoking article Even artichokes have doubts, but didn't find anything specific,2
Yesterday, I did a bit of searching again, and I think I have found the original source of the title, or rather, the source that the title seems to be alluding to,2
I think the title is a reference to a quote from the movie Amlie (Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amlie Poulain),2
The quote goes (Source: Amlie - Wikiquote):Vous au moins, vous ne risquez pas d'tre un lgume, puisque mme un artichaut a du cur.You couldn't even be a vegetable  even artichokes have a heart.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...,2
 Many factors make some languages more desirable to be learnt by people,2
On the global stage, English has emerged as the de-facto language that would make you most likely to be understood around the world,2
Some of the factors that contribute to this are:English is spoken in several countries around the world, so even passing competence in English is more likely to help you be understood around the world, whereas even expertise in Turkish is largely useless outside of Turkey,2
For a lot of people, the pragmatics of being able to communicate to a larger group of people far outweigh whatever motivations they may have for learning niche languages.English is massively culturally exported,2
Hollywood in particular and the American entertainment industry in general have given the world countless movies, TV programming, songs and the like that play over the radio or can be seen on TV no matter what country you are in,2
On the other hand, while some people might like Turkish music and watch Turkish movies outside of Turkey, Turkish culture has a significantly smaller active impact on the world.Because of the above factors, the knowledge of English often increases people's mobility, employability (and often, provides access to a much greater pool of information, or resources), much more compared to knowledge of relatively niche languages,2
If you look at the above points, you'd notice that they are largely interconnected,2
Each strengthens the other and it's the synergy across them all that makes English such a no-brainer of a choice around the world when it comes to choosing a language to learn,2
The following factors have little to no influence on most people's decision to learn a language: How old / culturally rich the language is: while this is of ample academic interest and would also interest literature / history enthusiasts, the fact that English is at least 600-700 years old has little to do with people learning it.How many people (pure numbers) speak the language: The spread of a language is much more important,2
A third of the world speaks Mandarin (or a close variant),2
Who cares? They are all largely concentrated in one part of the world,2
The Chinese stand to gain much more by learning English than the other way round,2
Likewise for Bengali,2
It's spoken by 210 million people,2
A very impressive figure, until you realize that most of them are in a very small part of the world (West Bengal and Bangladesh).Now let's move to Indian languages,2
As a language spoken in several Indian states, and understood to some extent by most of North India, Hindi lends itself more naturally as a lingua franca even in places that don't have it as a native language,2
With larger movement of people across the country, especially to IT hubs such as Bangalore, Hyderabad, and to some extent Chennai, Hindi is now establishing itself as a fairly staple language of these parts too,2
Note that this does not mean that Hindi is the only language there or that people do not speak local languages or English: there are tonnes of people in South India who do not speak Hindi,2
But a (only) Hindi speaker will be better off on the streets of Bangalore than a (only) Malayalam speaker on the streets of Chandigarh,2
So, it's a simple question of pragmatics outweighing everything else,2
A lot of people are not specifically enthusiastic about going out of their way to learn a new language,2
I mean, they would probably try to learn basic vocabulary and some abuses (which everyone loves to pick up), but they will do only as much is necessary to get by,2
If they are naturally immersed in the language, they would largely pick it up organically anyway,2
So I don't think it's so much about hesitation as about not having to.,2
 I think the multilingual dubs of Let it Go are largely an internet phenomenon; and when it comes to the internet, there is very little to gain by creating content in Hindi, since most Indians who consume content on the internet are likely to know English, and many of them might not have Hindi as their first language anyway.Plus, as another person said, it was probably not worth the effort (and investment) for them because India wasn't a strong target market for them even for the movie, let alone for internet videos.This kinda feeds into the side-effects of the linguistic plurality of India and the dominance of English among the educated masses,2
You would see a general lack of quality and quantity when it comes to production and consumption of content in non-English languages by Indians,2
It is our own doing,2
How many of us English-knowing Hindi speakers consume (let alone create) Hindi content, in any form? Do we read blogs in Hindi? Do we tweet or put FB statuses in Hindi? When was the last time someone staying in a big city read a Hindi newspaper? We are the hip crowd who, every time the Hindi dub of an English movie is released, can't go beyond the "omg what a ridiculous translation of the movie title,2
wtf is naagshakti why can't they just say Slytherin",2
This is a chicken and egg problem,2
There aren't too many good Hindi fonts, nor is there quality content in Hindi (whether in the terms of blogs or news websites or whatever) proportional to the number of people who speak it.Disney movies and shows usually do get dubbed into Hindi (and even Tamil, Telugu etc.) for Indian Television, so I guess they do bother to put in the effort when they think it'll be worth it.,2
 When people write their SOP (Statement of Purpose) while applying to graduate school or jobs, they write sentences like:"After completing my project in #FancyTopicName working with Prof,2
#BigShot, I decided to do an internship at #PrestigiousMNC so that I could apply my theoretical knowledge to real world problems and gain experience of the corporate environment"While writing SoPs, people talk as if their life path was perfectly charted out in advance, complete with Gantt Charts and Key Deliverables,2
You'd get the impression that everything they did was carefully choreographed and optimized for best performance,2
I am sure there exist a few such people who are blessed with both remarkable clarity and remarkable luck, but for most of us, this is usually not the case.People in college do usually have a (very) broad idea of what they like, and many have a general desire to do well and be successful, but most of them keep exploring, finding opportunities and making the most of the ones they get, and it is only in retrospect that the dots connect.You could consider doing the following to help your search:Don't be idle,2
Keep experimenting / enhancing yourself,2
If something interests you, try to focus on strengthening your profile in it,2
Do extra courses or try to work on a project with a professor, read up about it or talk to others who are pursuing it..,2
Nowadays it's fairly easy to pick up new talents or skills if you really want to.Maintain good academic standing,2
A lot of things that I mentioned in the first point would be easier to access if you maintain good academic standing,2
Especially in the beginning, when you don't have specific experience, you might get good opportunities purely based on your grades / CPI,2
These will then help you gain more experience,2
One leads on to another,2
Like it or not, for the most part, CPI is not an unreasonable metric to judge the ability to put in hard work and persevere.Look all around,2
At IITB, for instance, I've come across people doing all kinds of things, from the run-of-the-mill to the obscure, and often succeeding in it,2
Watching all these varied people engaged in a motley bunch of things is useful in two ways: It lets you know the kind of options you have, and it also shows you that those options are feasible,2
Use this to tell yourself that there's a lot you can do, but obviously do not limit yourself to what has already been done.The problem with people with stereo-typically 'good' profiles is that life often does not take their decisions for them through rejection,2
It's easy to decide when you have just 1-2 viable options; it's tougher when you have 10 of them,2
Try not to get overwhelmed by them, and instead try to derive a sense of security or comfort from them,2
As for absolute clarity about what you want to do, well..,2
that may never come,2
If it does for you, consider yourself very fortunate.,2
 A resume of some sort is usually always required when applying for any position (even those procured via personal contacts, which involve Dad calling his friend who works at a good company and requesting them to place you).You might not have a lot of stuff to write about in your second year resume, but that applies to most people who have just finished freshmen year,2
Don't worry about it,2
I just went through my freshie year resume for reference,2
Consider including the following stuff:Your rank in standardized exams: JEE, BITSAT etc,2
Olympiad performance (if applicable)Your Class X and XII Board percentageCourse project you did in first year, if applicableAny extra-curricular activities that you were part of in first yearAny other school level competitive exams that you might have participated in (NSO, NSTSE, NCO etc.)Any major activities or clubs that you were a part of in high school, or competitions you won, or positions you head, such as head boy / girl or House captainAny other awards or honors that you won in high school or first yearBest of luck!,2
 Today is 4th July, the American Independence Day,2
The American Declaration of Independence contains the lines:"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS."Extremely lofty ideals, undersigned by people who owned multiple slaves on their estates, while asserting and championing the cause of Equality.I imagine this question resonates with a lot of people who are probably reluctant to ask the same thing out aloud for fear of having some unpleasant label (sexist!, misogynist!, entitled male douchebag!, mail chauvinist pig) stuck onto them,2
The problem with replacing 'feminism' with 'equal gender rights' is that it, to a certain extent, trivializes or hides the fact that it is indeed women who've gotten the raw end of the deal across the years, and that actions specific to reversing this need to be taken to undo the mindsets of the people, and the consequence of the current eco-system,2
It is true that gender normativism, gender stereotypes, patriarchy and related factors hurt everyone,2
It hurts the woman whose gender becomes an automatic and unfair metric for judging her technical skills.It hurts the man who can't pursue fields that interest him and is forced to study 'engineering' because 'soft fields are for women' and because 'how will he run a family with his arts degree?'It hurts the couple who would probably be better off if the wife with better educational qualifications and experience worked and earned for the family and the husband with a knack for parenting stayed home and took care of the kids.It is also true that, as a corollary of the above, both genders also get superficial 'perks',2
Listing just a couple:Women receive perks from the medieval concept of 'chivalry': there is the expectation that men would pay for them on dates, offer them seats on the bus, brave the cold to keep them warm, get into fights to 'protect their honor' and what not.Deifying women and putting them on a pedestal: this is common in Indian culture, for example, with women being called 'Devis' (Goddesses),2
The flip side of this 'respect' is even less independence.The stuff written here is particularly dangerous, since it promotes an insidious culture that conveys the impression that there is a perfectly level playing field for men and women,2
In other words, it results in women winning minor so-called skirmishes (not having to pay for meals) while massively losing the actual battle (not having autonomy in general),2
It also leads to a certain feeling of entitlement on the part of men, who are raised to believe that they 'deserve' female companionship (or, sometimes, more bluntly, sex) because they 'did their part' (paid on dates, bought expensive gifts, went around shopping, and what not),2
This manifests itself in various forms, from the fashionable concept of the Friendzone, to more drastic consequences such as the Isla Vista killings.Finally, the root cause of injustices against both men and women is the patriarchal framework,2
For instance, men find it tougher to get custody because of the inherent assumption that women are better care givers, and what not,2
My problem with 'Equalism' is that it sets a target that most reasonable people cannot disagree with, without providing clarity about what exactly needs to be done, and masking out the fact that the playing field is tilted in one very-specific direction,2
As Eivind says in Eivind Kjrstad's answer to Is there a gender-neutral term for feminism?, the term would be fine "if the world we live in was roughly balanced between women and men", which it isn't.There is a FB group called "IITians against rape",2
It's a bunch of very well-meaning people, but I find the name rather hilarious,2
Being against rape is like the most trivial lower bound I expect IITians (or any decent human being) to pass; however, as I pointed out in Let's get rid of the misogyny, shall we?, well-meaning people who do not rape can still behave irresponsibly in other ways,2
"Humans for equalism" is then similar to saying "IITians against rape",2
It is not wrong, but, as long as there remain inequities, whitewashing them with neutral terms or trivial objectives isn't going to cut it.[1] I don't wish to convey that 'not having to pay for meals' is a female aspiration; all I am saying that, everything else being equal (which it isn't, but that's what people think), not having to part with money is better than having to part with money.,2
 The US gets a lot of flak for not using the metric system in everyday life,2
Why they don't change is easy to understand (it's a huge pain in the ass, with hardly any return),2
But it's not like the metric system is a perfect, universally applicable system.Powers of 10 are great for scientific calculations, but they are mostly terrible for visualization or approximation in everyday life,2
A centimeter is often too small and a meter often too big, and no one uses decimeter, so it doesn't matter that it exists,2
Because of the factor of 10, these units aren't conveniently divisible into thirds or fourths, which is again not conducive to everyday use,2
Think of recipes, for example,2
The cup, tea-spoon, table-spoon, fl,2
oz,2
system provides an easy, small-whole-number system for converting quantities,2
It is true that the non-standardization of what a cup or spoon is leads to inexactness, but in most cases, you can still scale recipes by using relative units,2
You ought to choose units based on what you are measuring,2
Height, for example is mostly measured in feet and inches even in India, and I find it more convenient than using the meters scale where most people would be between 1.5 and 2,2
Another example is temperature--the boiling point of water, no matter how important it is to Science, is of little consequence in every day life, especially since even temperatures lower than that are dangerous for humans,2
The freezing point calibration is more meaningful for people living in cold areas, but like another answer suggested, having a scale which uses the lowest and highest ambient temperatures you will experience as 0 and 100 anchors is pretty meaningful,2
So, there is nothing inherently 'practical' about the Celsius scale, and it could be argued that the Fahrenheit scale is more 'natural' for daily use.It is easy to visualize a quantity double or triple of a given amount; it's not easy to reliably visualize 10x of a quantity,2
For instance, you can see how big a centimeter is, but it doesn't instantly give you intuition for how big a meter would be,2
And visualizing 1000 such meters is again not trivial,2
So it's not like the 10x multiplier helps a lot in everyday life,2
If you are measuring driving distance, the fact that a centimeter is one ten-thousandth of a kilometer is largely useless,2
So a mile is equally well suited for expressing such distances, since both are arbitrary units anyway.The moral of the story is that while the merits of using metric units in scientific computation are plenty, they are not necessarily the most natural units to use for everyday life,2
Of course, it is possible to use them, like Europe does, but the best strategy of course is to use whatever tool you find convenient for your purpose.,2
 To better help you out, the mentorship team at IIT Bombay (known as the Institute Student Mentorship Program or ISMP) has come up with a compilation of relevant information for all the UG programs at IITB,2
This website has a lot of material, and the aim has been to provide students with detailed information about the curriculum and general job portfolios of every department,2
We try to keep it updated every year with the help of students and alumni,2
Hopefully, it will help you make a more informed choice,2
Visit: IIT Bombay Programmes.Apart from you branch, the bigger overall aspect that will affect your experience is of course your life on campus, and for everything about your next 4-5 years at IITB, from academics (or as we like to call itacads) to hostel life to Cultural (cult) and Technical (tech) activities..,2
To give you a better insight into how life@IITB will be and how you can prepare better for your hostel stay, we initiated a "Freshmen Forum" back in 2010, which we hope will be as useful to you as it has been to the previous 5 batches of IIT entrants.Around 70% of all new entrants register on this forum,2
It is maintained by institute mentors, and is the ideal platform for pre-freshmen (freshie-embryos?) to interact among themselves and with seniors,2
If you have apprehensions about ragging or want to know what to (not) get from home, you'll find answers to most questions there.Feel free to ask away @ Freshmen Forum 2014.Links:IIT Bombay Programmes Freshmen Forum 2014 - Index,2
 I have written about this in the About section of my blog Linguistrix, so will cross-post relevant stuff here,2
There's also a lot of relevant fodder from my SoPs :)For someone who's deeply into Languages and Linguistics, I started rather late,2
Although my first experience with Linguistics was in Class VIII, when my English teacher taught me how to write the phonetic transcription for English words.I got to know of phonetics, learnt how sounds are produced, how stresses and intonation work in languages, and how the phonemic inventories of the world's languages were so different yet analyzable using the same tools,2
But it wasn't until after I had taken JEE that I actually started exploring languages,2
Although linguistics itself isn't necessarily about learning languages, having some background in linguistics does make it easy to pick up new languages,2
In the largely creative atmosphere of IIT Bombay, I got the opportunity to pursue academic interests peripheral to my major,2
I studied French and earned the DELF B1 certification,2
I used audio courses to study elementary German, Arabic and Spanish,2
I enrolled in a Japanese course and passed the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) level N4, after which I promptly took up Mandarin, which I studied for a while,2
I became a regular reader of LanguageLog, the world's best blog on linguistics, and have learnt a lot from the posts there and gotten exposed to a wide range of linguistic issues,2
I also read books like 'The Language Instinct' and 'The Atoms of Language', which further piqued my curiosity.I also took an undergraduate course in linguistics, where I found myself in my element,2
Next, I took a course on Paninian Grammar, in which we studied the linguistic basis of ancient Sanskrit grammatical texts.I figured it'd be interesting to do something that combines my various interests, and Computational Linguistics seemed like a good option,2
So now here I am, finishing a Masters in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington, Seattle, and up for hire in the job market!,2
 I dislike most selfies, but not for deep psychological reasons,2
My reason is very personal and very, err, selfishMost selfies aren't good,2
By good, I mean, good-looking photographs that have value for people other than those photographed (or their very close friends),2
And because of social media, we have to end up seeing them anyway,2
However, that should of course not stop people from taking them,2
Which is why I speak just for myself.In the last few years, mobile cameras were getting better, so you came across plenty of decent pictures on your stream,2
At the same time, more and more people started owning DSLRs, or had friends with DSLRs, so you ended up seeing lots of good quality pictures on your feed,2
If pictures are aesthetically pleasing, they are fun to look at.Then came selfies, which took us back to the 2009 era in terms of overall photo quality,2
Portrait shots look best at higher focal lengths, and the effect of low focal lengths on selfie shots can best be seen below,2
Notice how the leftmost shot of the woman and the rightmost shot of the man are 'selfie-like', while the opposite end is the kind of shot you'd see in a magazine.(Couldn't find the original source for either image,2
Both have been uploaded several times on various websites).So now people choose to chronicle major events of their life (weddings, graduation etc.) with selfies,2
These were the kind of events for which I'd earlier see extremely high quality shots taken in good lighting conditions,2
Photographs that were a pleasure to look at even if you didn't directly care about the event,2
Now, we get grainy, close-range shots with 5-6 seemingly dismembered and 2-3 partially covered heads with everything looking out of proportion,2
Definitely not my favorite style for capturing special moments.All that being said, it's their choice to make, not mine to prescribe,2
Nonetheless, it is an interesting and curious social trend.,2
 I think the golden standard for pranks is that, at the end of it, the prankee enjoys it, or at least, can derive fun / humor out of it,2
This usually rules out most pranks that cause physical harm, or put the person in considerable danger,2
Dangling someone from their feet over a ledge would mostly count as bullying, not pranking, for example, even if you have no desire to drop them.Also, I hate 'Crying Wolf' style of pranks, where you give your well-wishers a false alarm for the sake of a prank,2
The most recent example I found is a commercial launched by Airtel (idea flicked from a similar Carlsberg commercial),2
The Airtel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...) one looks excessively fake and seems to have been terribly executed, but the idea remains the same"Call your friend late at night and tell them that your life is in danger, and that they need to come and save you." I find these to be in extremely bad taste, and just watching the video was so infuriating, that I am sure if any of my friends pulled such an asshole-y trick on me, it'd be the last time I ever had anything to do with them.Stuff that causes fairly short-lived confusion / fear but doesn't otherwise cause any harm is usually kosher,2
Switching shaving cream for toothpaste, although very flimsy, is kosher,2
Switching hot water for cold water, which then proceeds to scald the user, is not.Finally, a much milder variation of the 'crying wolf' prank, which I'd illustrate using a personal story.When I was a kid, our school once declared the next day as a holiday for some reason,2
It wasn't a regular scheduled holiday, so my parents were not aware of it,2
I went back home, secretly happy about getting a day off, and decided to make a prank out of it,2
I let my dad in on the prank, telling him about the holiday, but asking him not to tell my mom,2
I'm a bit hazy on the details but my 'plan' was that I'd wake up a bit late the next day, and delay everything so as to get late for the school bus,2
Then, when the whole household would freak out and my mom'd probably ask my Dad to drive me to the school, I'd shout Surprise! and reveal the truth,2
Everything happened as per the plan, except when I yelled surprise, my mom just said quietly"You could have pranked your Dad instead,2
He gets up late,2
At least I won't have had to wake up at 4:30 am to prepare your lunch,2
I could have gotten some extra sleep for a change." I had a chance to choose between a good prank and a bad prank, and I screwed it.,2
 In general, when people talk loudly to foreigners, they also tend to speak slightly slowly or tend to pronounce words more carefully and clearly,2
These things definitely make it easier to understand a foreign language, especially since a lot of phonetic reductions that are natural for a fluent speaker are very unintuitive to a person who has limited knowledge of the language.Be very careful with this though,2
Loud, slow, directed speech, especially if combined with gestures, can come off as extremely condescending and rude, and gives the impression that you think the listener is stupid.Since the line between accommodating and condescending is not too difficult to step on, err slightly on the side of caution,2
If you have more general command of the language (native / fluent speaker), you should ideally try to tune your speech to your listeners's language level,2
That is, try to speak almost naturally, see if the listener can cope up, and tone it down a bit as needed.,2
 The best thing is to check with the host so that you don't end up with 10 packets of Doritos or 5 bottles of ketchup, but if you are looking for ideas, there are loads of possibilities,2
All of the below can be picked up from a supermarket.Beverages: Soda, Iced-Tea, Iced-Coffee, Beer, Wine, Liquor, as depending on what kind of potluck it is,2
Cocktail mixes (such as a margarita mix) are also useful,2
Condiments / Dressings: Ketchup, Mustard, Salsa, Ranch, Peppers, Sauerkraut, Olives etc.Dessert: Cookies, Pies, Ice-cream, Cakes, Marshmallows etc.Miscellaneous: Chips / Tostitos, Cheese platter, Fresh fruits, Veggies, Salads etc.,2
 I can think of a lot of very useful things, and I won't possibly recall them all at the same time, so I will update this list as I do,2
I would also refrain from using superlatives such "My mom is the best mom in the world!"while they are cute and I can appreciate the sentiment behind them, they do not give a lot of useful information,2
Personal growthFilled the house with books and cultivated in me a love for reading, which I share with my mother,2
I was reading books in English, Hindi and Marathi as long as back as I can remember.Tried to give me access to stuff,2
I grew up very technology literateused computers since I was 7 (this was in the 90s mind you; now kids are anyway born into computers; I am waiting for the first foetal selfie), started learning programming at the age of 9, and in general, spent a lot of time tinkering with stuff.Since both my parents work, I've spent large amounts of time alone at home,2
To a large extent, they didn't police me around excessively and put unnecessary restrictions,2
To give you a very 90s example, we almost always had Cable TV at home while many other kids had it only during vacations,2
To my credit, I was never much of a TV-watcher anyway.Financial MattersWe were comfortable but we were not filthy rich, so they shielded me from any day to day financial woes if any, but made sure I still had the 'global picture',2
I think that being subjected on a daily basis to the family's financial issues is pointlessly stressful for kids (who can't do anything to solve them anyway), while completely shielding them from these matters makes them extremely sheltered and they end up with no perspective of where the family stands.By example more than instruction, taught me responsible financial decision making,2
Before any big purchase, we always spent time researching our options and trying to ensure we were making a reasonable choice,2
The result is that I rarely make impulse purchasesthere's always a bit of 'due diligence', so to speak.In the same vein, taught me financial triage by example,2
They didn't mind spending, but they tried to spend it on the right things,2
They spent on fairly expensive books (which, in today's money, might have costed, say, INR 3000-4000), but would have probably cringed at spending the same money on a single night, eating out.MiscellaneousMaintained a largely peaceful environment at home,2
I didn't grow up witnessing constant shouting matches,2
When I discuss this with people whose experience has been otherwise, they tell me that parental conflict was a big source of stress during their childhood,2
I particularly remember the most glowing example of this strategy,2
In the March-April period of my 12th grade, when all kids sit for various crucial and decisive competitive examinations, I remember that my mother had declared the house to be an absolutely zero-conflict zone, meaning that no one shouted, bickered or had unnecessary arguments in the house for those 4-5 weeks,2
Anticipated my growth needs and didn't hesitate in taking decisions towards it,2
My mom led the initiative to transfer me to a new school (further from home and more expensive) when she realized I wasn't getting enough exposure,2
My parents are very helpful and hospitable; it's a bit difficult to put into words but would be amply clear to someone who has been at the receiving end of their hospitality,2
I like to think that at least some of that has rubbed off into me too; I try my best to help people out.Many of the sentences here sound like lines out of a resume,2
If only the stuff you did as a parent could be written in resumes...P.S,2
I guess this is also a great time to wish my mom on Mother's Day and thank her for all of the above and for all the rest that I can't even begin to put into words.,2
 I hope that, by graduate studies, you mean something akin to an MS and not a PhD,2
You shouldn't join a PhD program abroad if it is not paying you any salary at all and requires you to take loans.While it's not possible to suggest what you should do without a more detailed understanding of your family's financial situation, as a general rule, I won't particularly recommend selling off family assets if you can avoid it.INR 30 Lakh is not an insanely large loan amount if you are going to enter an industry that is well-paying (which seems to be the case),2
For instance, if this were a CS degree, and you were going to get into Software Development jobs, you are all but assured an annual income of (at least) around USD 80 K.Job markets can be tough, though, and things can be trickier in Europe, so you should have a realistic assessment of all that,2
If your undergrad (and now grad) are from prestigious universities, that would certainly make things a bit easier.This also, of course, depends on where the asset is,2
If it is depreciating rapidly due to any reason, you might consider selling it,2
But most land assets in developing / upcoming cities in India usually appreciate more than your loan interest rate,2
Either way, this is something you should discuss with someone who has a better idea of the property market, and that is certainly not me.Finally, you should apply for scholarships in India that provide interest free loans,2
Some of them are: Narotam Sekhsaria Scholarship, K C Mahindra Fellowship, J N Tata Endowment Scholarship,2
Note that this year's cycle is largely over, so if you want one of those you might have to apply next year.(A2A),2
 A lot of people love traveling on freeways since it helps reduce travel time, lets you drive faster than you can in cities, and doesn't have a red light every couple of hundred feet,2
But how many people care about the US freeway system enough to memorize which freeway passes through which city (even in parts of the country they have never visited or care about) or to study the intricacies of freeway intersection design despite no other specific interest in Civil Engineering?(Source: Wikipedia)The first category of people I have described have largely a functional interest in those respective topics, such as liking cars because they help you move,2
The second category's chief motivation for their interest from an inherent enthusiasm or devotion for that subject matter which goes far beyond what the functional requirements it can (or needs to) serve, such as identifying a car from the skid-pattern its tires make, a skill that is of little use outside of forensics,2
I should point out here that not all such people manage to invest all the time that's needed to pursue this interest, but a lot of them do want to.The general term for such people is geeks,2
Geek is not a universal label,2
It usually goes with specific subject-matter, such as car-geek, or train-geek, or astronomy-geek (though it is true that without the specific label, a geek is usually assumed to be a tech-geek, but that's besides the point).People like to put themselves into such labeled groups because it is a means of self-identification, and also simultaneously a means of signaling to and finding others with similar interests,2
It can be intensely frustrating to have a hobby that you do not share with anyone around you,2
Worse, it's absolutely soul-crushing to be surrounded by people who not only don't share your hobby, but can't associate with that sort of crazed up geeky obsession with anything.And so if you are like a friend of mine, you'd join the Indian Railways Fan Club mailing list and would love to discuss this topic with others who can identify the make of a diesel engine by the sound of its horn.That brings us to food,2
Many people use the term foodies to refer to food geeks,2
I personally am not a fan of the word, largely because it sounds kinda childish, and, like most labels, it tends to be applied to anyone and everyone and sort of loses the point,2
But the ultimate arbiter of language is usage, so I am fine if someone wishes to describe themselves using it,2
Also, I am very skinny, and the first question people ask is "But if you love food how come you are so thin!?",2
Another is "But IITians to kuchh bhi khaa lete hain naa" [But IITians can anyway eat anything right],2
That gets tiring fast.You might be a food geek, if, as some others have suggested, you care about more than just the functional use of food,2
You care about knowing more about how it's made, possibly making it yourselves, about what goes into it and how the various ingredients contribute to the final taste, about possessing interesting tools, devices, utensils etc to help you in your cooking, and about the kinds of skills people who cook food professionally exhibit (I have spent way too much time staring at cooks deftly throwing dough into the air to roll it for Pizza bases or Rumali Roti, and at people chopping onions at blazing speed):https://youtu.be/0tpvNUH3KDI?t=5sSo, yes, there is more to being a food-geek than just wanting to eat food,2
And people who share that extra enthusiasm for food like to identify themselves and possibly others.,2
 Consultancy firms usually like to see excellence in whatever you want to do (usually called spikes in the resume, and I will use that term here without loss of generality) and in my experience with the IIT process, usually aren't too picky about any one kind of excellence,2
The ideal profile of course has more than one spike, but I have seen loads of people getting shortlisted for interviews with excellence in just 1 domain (or a bunch of very closely related domains),2
Some of the 'standard' examples (but by no means exhaustive) of strong profiles in particular domains are:AcademicTop of the class with a very good CPI (say DR 5 or better, and 9+),2
Research experience, especially at reputed institutions,2
If papers / patents, then even better,2
Other awards or achievements surrounding academics.Cultural / SportsDomination or significantly wide-spread participation, victory and involvement in a culture genre / sport, including wins at various level such as intra- and inter-college levels,2
Any other formal acknowledgment if possible.OrganizationalStrong leadership roles at hostel or institute level or those involving large projects or dealing with a lot of people,2
and so on..,2
In each of these, you'd notice that the usual expectation is that you do whatever you are doing really well,2
There do exist small differences in the preferences of the top 4-5 consulting firms,2
I have noticed, for example, that one of them has been focusing on very stereotypically academic profiles in the last 2-3 years, while another focuses rather strongly on people with organizational experience,2
A CPI of 8, however, while being good, probably isn't amazing enough to be a spike, but you should hope that your other academic achievements make up for it.From what you describe, I imagine that at least some consulting firms would find your profile interesting, though they might be a bit skeptical of whether you really want to be in consulting, given that your profile is particularly well suited for academia and research,2
This is something you have to first convince yourself of, and then the firms you apply to,2
Best of luck!,2
 One of the top answers on this page (by Robert Frost) suggests that "Be a man" means to evidence the aspirational characteristics of a grown man, such as strength, bravery and control.If words could mean whatever the heck we wanted them to while ignoring the ground reality of how they are used by society, then I could posit that calling a woman a 'bitch' actually compliments her reproductive ability by assigning her the characteristics of a female dog in heat,2
After all, that is what the literal meaning seems to be, and there is nothing wrong in being called a female dog anyway, right?Unfortunately, the meanings and implications of words, which they absorb based on the way they are used, cannot just be wished away, and even if the speaker who uses them is clean of intent, they can still have ill-effects."Be a Man" is the kind of exhortation that is almost exclusively directed at boys and men, and is usually in response to displays of emotion or sentiment or 'weaknesses' which are considered fine when done by women,2
Note that this is unfair to both men and women,2
I am sure corollaries of the same can be found in cultures around the world,2
Hindi popular culture has a line Mard ko dard nahin hotaa (A real man doesn't feel pain),2
This kind of messaging is fairly pervasive in society,2
For instance, guys who cry are usually asked not to cry like (little) girls,2
As a side note, I find the societal prejudice against crying rather laughable, since I find it to be of immense therapeutic value.Of course it is true that most people who ask others to 'man up' or to 'be a man' aren't necessarily misogynists themselves,2
But this name-calling achieves absolutely nothing anyway,2
You could pluck petals and count 'Misogynist! Not a misogynist!', if you want, and we would get no further as a society unless we figure out exactly why such statements are problematic and correct the problem.As Gayle has suggested in her answer, whether we like it or not, misogynist or not, well-intentioned or not, this phrase (and specifically, its common usage):perpetuates a lot of (hetero-normative) gender stereotypestakes some supposed ideals (such as excessive stoicism) and sets them up as specifically associated with menassociates the negative quality of the lack of said dubious ideals with the female genderA certain amount of stoicism in the face of adverse circumstances is a positive quality, but encouraging (or rather peer-pressuring / bullying) people to bottle their emotions up forever because displaying them is unmanly is hardly the ideal we want to set up as a society anyway, as Eivind has pointed out in a long comment debate below one of the answers.Moreover, I find this phrase pretty indefensible even if we were to ignore the 'display of emotion' aspect and focused entirely on stuff like bravery or altruism,2
As cliche as it sounds, kids should rather be getting the message that they ought to be brave because they are good human beings, and not just because they are boys / men who have to act as knights in shining armor for their fragile princesses.Back when I was in primary school, if any of the boys had very long hair, the biggest threat the teacher used to offer was that if the kid didn't get a haircut soon, they'd put a clip / band on his head,2
These are kids in single-digit ages, and they are already learning that society considers it embarrassing for guys to be like girls.I could go on and on and cite examples, but I hope I have made my point,2
This kind of harmful messaging is all-pervasive, and phrases like "Be a man" are instances of the same, no matter what their original, optimistic intention be,2
I should point out here that "Be a lady" is almost equally regressive,2
A phrase sometimes found in Hindi stories is   (literally: diffidence / shyness fit for a lady),2
We no more want to teach girls they should always be diffident and shy than we want to teach boys that they should suck it up and not cry.When people talk about empowering women and removing gender divides, they focus largely on reducing rape and increasing employment for women,2
Most of us never realize the inimical effect of all these tiny but constant and ubiquitous signals that we as a society send to ourselves.I know all this seems like petty nitpicking, but I hope that we all agree that, as a society, we should be moving away from such normativity and especially from deriving modern-day ideals from the middle-ages.We cannot stem all of it, but the least we can do is to not actively condone it.,2
 Here are some things that usually never get told, and I figure they are worth giving a thought to,2
I'll talk about three things:Eschew Department StereotypesLook for full disclosureHave Fun with AcadsEschew Department StereotypesEver since the day you came to know about your branch allocation, you must have been inundated by pointless, irrelevant and often wrong feedback about your department,2
It will worsen now that you are in IIT, with every other person commenting on your branch selection and passing along traditional wisdom,2
If youve taken a low-ranking branch despite getting a high rank, youd be called stupid,2
If youve opted for Dual Degree when your rank allowed you to choose BTech, youd be called stupid,2
If you let it be known that you intend to do research in Meta, youd be called stupid,2
You will soon realize that, as a freshie, its very easy to be called stupid..Its also equally devoid of content,2
By giving in to department stereotypes, you not only straitjacket yourself, you fall prey to years of prejudice,2
Choosing Meta is not stupidbut whiling the first two semesters away because you were told Meta is a lukkha branch is,2
Obviously, branch does matter,2
All men may be created equal, but all branches certainly are not, which makes it all the more important that you have a realistic idea about your branch, instead of swallowing recycled stereotypical trash hook, line, and sinker.Department stereotypes are self-fulfilling propheciespeople tell you there are no future prospects in X branch, and you spend your IIT life resigned to this fatality, while wiser people go ahead, pursue those prospects, and get them.Eschew Department Stereotypes.Look for full disclosureAs freshies, you would find yourself at the receiving end of advice, suggestions, opinions, recommendations and what not from a wide variety of people (including, rather ironically, from me, through this post),2
Develop the judgment to figure out whose opinion to take on a particular matter,2
It is very rare that youd encounter a person who could give you valuable advice across a large and diverse array of fields,2
The guy who gives you excellent dating advice wont necessarily give you great foreign-internship fundae,2
And the friend who you trust your deepest secrets with might give you lousy advice about which elective to take.Also, look for full disclosure,2
Often, a lot of what people would tell you would be tainted with whats good for them instead of whats good for you,2
Did the hostel sports secy just tell you its not necessary to study for next days Maths Quiz because he wanted you to go cheer for the Hostel Water Polo team? Did a CG/Manager just tell you CPI doesn't matter? Did your neighborhood 10 pointer just tell you extra-currics are useless? No one really wishes you bad, but that doesn't mean you take in everything they say without scrutinizing it and looking for full disclosure.I find it funny when the only credential juniors offer about a piece of info/opinion is "Kisi senior ne bola hai" [Some senior told this to me],2
Avoid having "One Stop Seniors",2
At IIT, you find yourself part of a diverse group of brilliant people,2
Everyones different, and unique,2
Theres a huge wealth of experience to tap into,2
Talk to everyone, but take a smart call about who you would trust best for what.Look for full disclosure.Have Fun with AcadsIIT(B) is not Three Idiots; it is not Rang De Basanti; it is not Main Hoon Na,2
In fact, it isn't anything like the stereotyped mush that Bollywood (and other mainstream media) feeds you under the all-inclusive heading college life.A common motif in most colleges, and IITB is no different, is a fashionably cavalier attitude towards academics,2
Its a screwed up system where not only is it OK to not study, its actually socially desirable,2
Instead of going into a hatred spiral where you teach yourself to not give a fuck about academics, try to look at courses and subjects as something potentially interesting,2
Obviously, neither all courses nor all professors will be fun, but youll be surprised at how much the quality of your experience would improve if you treat academics with slightly more openness.Ask questions,2
Interact,2
Maybe read up a bit,2
It wont need a change in your schedule,2
Just your attitude.Dont suck up to profs,2
But carry an ounce of empathy.Have Fun with Acads.This was originally written for my blog (To Freshies - Antariksh's Blog),2
Originally, this post was supposed to be a retrospective post about college,2
I took those elements and condensed them into a few things that Id want to say to the new batch at IIT,2
Theres nothing batch-specific about the post, though.,2
 I think it's great.And frankly, I don't quite get the negative hullabaloo around this at all,2
Most of the internet seems to have well-deserved appreciation for this move, but I've also read some nasty comments too, which I hope are not representative of the majority.Since the benefits of such a move by FB are self-evident to quite a few people, I'll rather answer key points of criticism that I found on the internet."This is the height of political correctness!"This has really nothing to do with political correctness,2
The fact is that not all people comfortably identify with the binary buckets that we like to put ourselves in for ease of classification,2
And I imagine it would be greatly relieving for such people if they are given greater freedom to choose.Plus, it causes no difference whatsoever to the lives of most of us who are lucky enough to have identities that more or less align with social norms,2
And it makes a positive difference to the lives of the relatively few who to whom it does matter,2
A friend of mine, for instance, changed their pronoun setting on FB to they from the original he,2
Did it make any difference to my life? No,2
Did it make some positive difference to my friend's life? Apparently it did.What exactly are we afraid of? That kids would now be exposed to these fancy-schmancy terms that 'weird people' use to describe each other? Well, perhaps this is an excellent time to have a discussion with kids about the fluidity of sex, sexuality, orientation, identity and about the difficulties involved in navigating a world that finds it too difficult to see any shades other than white and black,2
If it leads kids to have better understanding and sensitivity about any of these things, and it makes at least a few of them stop bullying that 'girly, sissy kid' in school, we would all be better as a society."We should strive to discourage gender stereotyping completely instead of giving people 50 buckets to stereotype others into"But this isn't about stereotyping either,2
It is true that there is diversity of form and expression in this domain,2
It is also true that this should not be grounds for discrimination,2
The two are rather independent,2
The solution to the problem of stereotyping isn't to declare that we stop acknowledging variation or diversity,2
The path to greater acceptance does not include brushing stuff under the carpet."This is just a move by FB to make more targeted advertising possible!"Well, that's certainly plausible,2
Or even highly probable,2
But let's look at the horrifying implications of that claima company that makes a very large percentage of its 7 billion dollar revenue out of advertising added a feature that helped increase its advertising revenue.So, yes, even if FB did it primarily to increase their ad-revenues, it still remains a fact that it lets people express themselves more freely,2
And that's a good thing.,2
 My roommates and I were discussing (in jest, in case that isn't clear) yesterday night that we should all root for Sundar Pichai for the MS CEO role, just so that we can maintain the IIT hegemony in the tech industry,2
Jokes apart, though, I think most people realize and acknowledge that hard work and stellar performance almost always trump academic pedigree,2
This is likely to be overwhelmingly true for the choice of a CEO, where you'd rather judge a person on the acumen they have shown and the results they have delivered for their company across the years, rather that what school they graduated from 25 years ago,2
If it is true that Sundar Pichai was a strong contender for the post, I am rather confident that at no point of the selection process did anyone say "But this one is from IIT and that one is not!", except perhaps as a joke.Academic pedigree does often help you (or make it easier to) get into desirable jobs in the beginning of your professional career,2
It also usually increases your chance of being at the right place at the right time, and of grabbing a good opportunity,2
It also makes it more likely to be part of a great peer group, and these things come with other synergistic effects,2
It is also likely to lead to a more enriching undergraduate / graduate experience,2
But it is neither necessary nor sufficient for being 'successful' in life, and this probably stands true for a widely diverse range of metrics of success.IITians would do well to realize (if there are those that already don't do so) that the IIT on their resume doesn't give them a trump card or an all-access pass, and those who could not get into IIT despite wanting to would be well-advised to not consider their academic background a major impediment.This is true for the IITs, just as it is true for top US schools, and I don't think Satya Nadella's appointment has changed that.[1] I am assuming here that many people consider an IIT degree to be academic pedigree.,2
 There are many ways in which running marathons seems to be well-placed as a fund-raising activity, and appeals to us more than many other fund-raising mechanisms.From the POV of the fund-raiserRunning is an activity that is accessible to almost all of us,2
Barring specific cases of handicap, everyone can run, no matter how old, young, thin, fat, tall, short, and no matter what their general athletic condition is,2
Everyone and their grandmother, almost quite literally, can run,2
There has also been research demonstrating that the human body is particularly well-suited for long distance running.In continuation of the above, running is largely money-agnostic,2
Casual runners do not need very specialized gear, and you don't need access to fancy courts or other infrastructure,2
Feel like running? You can start today,2
You are rich? Doesn't matter,2
You are still gonna have to run yourself,2
Can't delegate it,2
This is also a kind of fund-raising activity that is not dependent on entry into elite social circles,2
Unlike, say, high-profile charity events,2
[Edit: it is true, though, that some marathon events tend to be very elitist and expensive for runners]Running, and the lead up to it when people train for it, promotes a culture of physical fitness,2
It creates positive idols, so to speak, and is therefore well suited with the whole charity image,2
Unlike, say, just starvation.A marathon is short enough an event to impact public memory and to attract media attention,2
If you want to do a 10-day long drawn out thing for charity, people are likely to get bored.From the POV of the donorIt doesn't ask money for a product / service that can otherwise be obtained at a potentially lower price / better quality elsewhere, and thus doesn't give you the feeling of being forced to spend money on something you probably don't need or appreciate,2
Unlike, say, scout-cookies.Deep down, I imagine that most of us have (not sure whether innate or conditioned) appreciation for raw hard work,2
Often, hard work and perseverance are considered as the ultimate arbiters, and running is the kind of activity that demonstrates pure, raw, determination and hard-work, untampered by anything else that'd tilt the playing ground,2
Rather, in continuation of the previous point, it abstracts out any product / service and replaces it with just hard work and perseverance,2
I will end with a small quote from Three Men on a Bummel by Jerome K Jerome Folks with nothing else to do, nursemaids chiefly and errand boys,with now and then a perambulating costermonger added, would gatheron the common of a fine morning to watch them pass, and cheer themost deserving,2
It was not a showy spectacle,2
They did not runwell, they did not even run fast; but they were earnest, and theydid their best,2
The exhibition appealed less to one's sense of artthan to one's natural admiration for conscientious effort.I think it's this natural admiration for conscientious effort, unfettered by anything else, that appeals to us all the most about marathon events.,2
 As a general rule, if you are in a foreign country, it is usually never a problem if you try to speak the local language [and appear to be making a genuine attempt rather than trying to mock them],2
The response you get may vary slightly with where you try this, but it is in general positive,2
In countries where English is taught but not really spoken all that much, the service staff would mostly be more than glad to talk to you in t the local language, and even humor your potentially wrong attempts at it,2
Even in places like India, where most people in the service industry (such as in fast-food places and so on) speak in English, and where English is relatively more common in every day life, we love listening to foreigners speak Hindi (or whatever the relevant local language is), even if it is just a terribly mispronounced "NuhMUHsTay",2
In some cases, though, especially in countries whose local language is spoken no where else, and where English literacy levels are very high, people are sometimes reluctant to talk to outsiders in the local language,2
Whether this is out of courtesy for the listener or out of the annoyance of having to listen to your language being butchered by a non-native speaker, or a mix of both, I don't know,2
Personally, as a language learning enthusiast, I find it very very annoying if I make an attempt to speak in the local language and I get replied to in English, but I usually give people the benefit of doubt and assume that they either did it out of courtesy or just wanted to practise English.Finally, when you are in the queue at a fast-food place or even in a busy supermarket, people might just not have the time or patience to entertain your attempts at trying to communicate in the local language if you are not making a lot of sense,2
So it might be better, in such circumstances, to communicate efficiently in English, and delay language practice to a more suitable time.Most people appreciate it when someone tries to learn / speak their language, and tend to warm up considerably to foreigners who do so,2
Don't miss the chance!,2
 I dont think Mood Indigo or IIT Bombay are at fault just because Palash Sen said something during Mood Indigo,2
As a matter of fact, if anything should tarnish IIT Bombays reputation, it should be the fact that Palash Sen said nothing that is not already expressed overtly or covertly in the male-dominated culture of the institute [1],2
The fact that most of the crowd cheered him instead of booing him is more telling,2
However, these are useful lessons for the future for everyone involved.Is Palash Sen sexist at heart? Does he lack respect for women? I don't know nor do I care,2
So, articles trying to prove that he is not sexist because he treats his coworkers well or because he wrote a song about mothers are not really relevant to the issue,2
The world probably won't become a better place even if we somehow proved so, because the issue isnt about who he is, but what he did.Specifically over-targeting Palash Sen, baying for his blood, calling for blanket bans on Euphoria, trying to somehow establish that he is sexist and an evil man, and other hyperbolic actions like these serve only to derail the actual issue that the Mood Indigo debacle has highlighted,2
And it's not often that such issues come into limelight,2
So lets use this opportunity to step back a bit and take stock of the situation instead of fulminating all over the internet.(In this answer, I will not use words that tend to bucket individual into 'opinion / action groups', such as feminists, misogynists, and the like,2
Let's attempt to see the whole issue without labels.)The first step is to understand why a certain faction of the society is displeased with what took place at the Euphoria concert at Mood Indigo,2
Mind you, what Palash Sen said is neither new in content nor category,2
As far as content goes, I am sure you've all heard stuff like this countless times,2
As for category, it was very representative of the kind of speech that peddles reductionary class-based stereotypes,2
There are reasons why such comments are frowned upon, and they have nothing to do with Palash Sen, Mood Indigo, or Euphoria,2
First, lets talk about stereotypes:Stereotyping by itself isn't always necessarily harmful,2
The key here is to understand what kind of environment a particular stereotype creates or perpetuates [2],2
For instance, in India, you may stereotype Bengalis as fond of sweets, or Tamilians as fond of curd rice,2
In absence of any other relevant evidence, this is a fairly harmless stereotype,2
However, if Bengalis are being systematically and unfairly persecuted by other communities because of their fondness for sweets, or if someone who doesnt like curd rice is systematically denying Tamilians equal opportunities just because they are from the South, it is easy to see how invoking such stereotypes would be below the belt.The second thing of note is that merely the fact that a stereotype is statistically correct doesn't make it okay to peddle it,2
It doesn't take a genius to observe that there are fewer women than men in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, while the reverse may hold for, say, the liberal arts,2
However, using this as proof that 'men are for brains' while women are for beauty is not correct,2
Additionally, it is important to realize that a possible reason for not too many women being in STEM fields is the fact that their participation receives significantly more social resistance than that received by men (if any),2
They also receive a continuous stream of both subliminal and overt messaging that discourages them from pursuing these fields,2
And when some of them do get into institutes like the IITs, they enter a male dominated world where guys are taught that IITian girls are ugly and non-male and what not,2
As if that were not enough, entertainers come to their cultural festivals and peddle this very stereotype again,2
And again,2
And again,2
Do you see why this is a problem?Two negatives stereotypes don't cancel each other,2
Saying 'girls are for beauty' doesn't become alright just because you also say 'boys are for intelligence',2
A couple of answers here seem to suggest that it's okay for someone to peddle patriarchal stereotypes if everyone is equally insulted,2
Sorry, but it doesn't work that way,2
Saying that boys shouldn't / can't cook is as bad as saying that girls shouldn't / can't,,2
 say, drive,2
Both perpetuate hetero-normative gender stereotypes,2
Palash Sen's comments feed into the very same patriarchal stereotypes, and are hence being considered to be in bad taste,2
Not only is mindless stereotyping therefore problematic in itself, but in a lot of cases, this affront comes from a privileged group that was often primarily responsible for causing the marginalization of the group that they are now mocking,2
Imagine being excessively bullied in school, being made to resent your existence, and then being laughed at by those very bullies for being in the wretched state you are in,2
Now imagine this happening day in and day out,2
Whether it be men mocking women, or whites mocking blacks, or the straight community mocking the LGBTQ community, such behavior is not too different from bullying.Whatever be the issue, such cavalier commentary is often so commonplace that most dont even realize that it is potentially harmful, and most dont realize that those who raise voices against it arent necessarily doing it for publicity.The second step is to realize that, as members of a class that has historically been privileged, it is not always easy for people to see or notice this disparity or discrimination,2
How many of you who are right-handed have noticed that the desks in many classrooms are much more difficult to use if you are left-handed? If you hadnt noticed this so far, that does NOT mean that you hate left-handed people,2
It doesnt mean that you dont want to help them,2
It just means that you have hitherto been completely unexposed to the problems of being left-handed because you have been lucky enough to have the world designed for the default setting that you belonged to,2
And that is perfectly fine,2
But when someone does point out why this is problematic, I think they deserve to be heard instead of being typecast as pseudo-whatever,2
IIT Bombay has now officially banned Euphoria,2
This is a bit like suspending a police officer for taking a 200-rupee bribe, or failing a student for cheating when everyone knows that most others cheated too,2
Its technically correct, but it doesnt necessarily improve anything in itself unless the system is cleansed too, because the police officer is mostly just a symptom of the bigger problem,2
[Later edit: I completely agree that celebrities (or anyone with a larger reach) should hold themselves to higher standards than others,2
But, these standards will come into place only when people realize and accept that there IS indeed a problem if you say in front of 10000 people that women are for beauty and men for intelligence,2
What annoys me isn't that Palash Sen said those things, but the fact that he so steadfastly refuses to acknowledge that they could indeed be problematic,2
It is clear that it's not a 'communication gap', since his clarifications are as incriminating as the initial claims,2
We all do slip up at times, but given time to look back at our actions, we should realize and own up if they were problematic,2
Palash Sen has refused to do that, and instead chose to bully those who raised their voice.So, not only did Palash Sen not show basic empathy, he: A) Trivialized the protest and mocked the protesters by making the facetious remark that they perhaps wanted to call him sexy/sexiest and not sexist,2
B) Refused to accept that what he said was problematic in any way,2
C) Tried to absolve himself of basic responsible behavior by implying that he didn't need to be mindful of what he said because he isn't a social activist.These are not signs of a man who hates women,2
But these certainly are signs of a man who, though he might respect women, is simply oblivious to the kinds of issues that plague our society,2
I expect better from our celebrities and role models.]And so, if our educational institutes really care, there is significantly more to be done by way of educating the thousands that pass through them, so that the next time someone says something like this at MI, we dont see statuses on FB suggesting that girls just cant take a joke.P.S,2
There are some additional issues here, which deserve some discussion, but this answer has already gotten too long, so I will probably write about them on my blog instead.[1] Let's get rid of the misogyny, shall we? - Antariksh's Blog [2] Gender Identity: What is wrong with sex-typing?,2
 Kinda sorta maybe yes, but like with everything, it's more complicated than that,2
Of course, it'd be nice if the English spelling system weren't so opaque,2
It would certainly help if more people could spell English words correctly more easily and learners (both native and non-native speakers) didn't have to waste a lot of time wrapping their head around the idiosyncracies of the English spelling system,2
After all, most other languages that use the Roman alphabet have a spelling system that's significantly more systematic than that followed by English,2
However, if your ideal is 'pure phonetic orthography', by which I take to mean that you're referring to a system that accurately and predictably represents in their spelling the exact pronunciation of English words, then you are in for a lot of trouble,2
First, which pronunciation? Even for languages that are spoken in a small area, you tend to get pronunciation variations across dialects, and across speakers,2
And that's for languages with a few hundred thousand speakers,2
Think about English, spoken by hundreds of millions all over the world,2
First language for some, second language for some others, and a third (or nth) language for the rest,2
Even within what you consider native speakers, you can expect to get a tremendous amount of variation, and it is tough to identify one canonical form.So, whose English would you spell phonetically? Would you spell pin and pen identically in Southern United States since the two words are homophones in their dialect? Or would caught and cot be spelled differently in Britain but identically in, say, Western United States? If everyone's gonna spell English their way (and they should be allowed to, if the whole point was to spell it purely phonetically), is this less chaotic, or more chaotic, than the status quo?Check out the variation in the caught-cot merger in North America (Source: Wikipedia),2
Mind you, this is just one particular variation,2
Furthermore, even if you did choose a dialect, what kind of speech should you accurately represent? A word spoken carefully as an individual utterance can sound very different from the same word spoken in a sentence, and even that can change based on stress and other factors,2
And finally, as a few others pointed out, it's sometimes worthwhile to maintain 'deep orthography',2
Since the words writer and rider are homophones in many US dialects, would you necessarily gain more by expressing the action of writing as write but the person who performs the action as raiduhr (or whatever system is chosen)?These are only some of the issues,2
Like it or not, at some level, spelling representations serve as abstractions of the underlying phonetic forms,2
Moreover, they are usually not expected to convey information to a person not familiar with the language,2
Even in languages with fairly unambiguous spelling systems (Indian languages, I am looking at you), the written form is almost never 'purely phonetic',2
The English spelling system should have been more regular,2
But purely phonetic? Not really.,2
 One of the first things taught in an introductory linguistics course is that our knowledge of our native language is tacit knowledge,2
It is notoriously difficult to actually write down the patterns that you observe in a language,2
But ask any native speaker if a sentence is grammatical, and they would tell you their judgment instantly.When people formally study their native language, or see others studying it, they are often introduced to the correctness conditions [1] of their language, or to interesting phono-morpho-syntactic tid-bits,2
This can be very fascinating, and very revealing, since they had probably never looked at their native language in that light,2
For instance, Hindi speakers might tell you that the Hindi spelling system is very phonetic and exactly represents words as they are spoken, but probably never realized that they pronounce a word like  in     differently from that in     (the nasalization in the terminal vowel of the second word is irrelevant to the example).There's also another factor in play here,2
Some people might still associate 'complexity' with language superiority or with a language being more developed / advanced / evolved (or similar pseudo-scientific terminology) based on how complex it is,2
And so there is some pressure towards maintaining the status of your language by asserting that it's fairly complex,2
Note that this doesn't mean that languages absolutely don't differ in their degrees of learning difficulty,2
Different aspects of a language may be of varying levels of difficulty for a learner based on the languages they already speak,2
And it is possible that aspects of a language may take a child slightly longer to pick up,2
But, in general, it's not a good idea to trust uninformed native intuition about the difficult level of their language.[1] I deliberately refrain from calling them 'rules' since most people interpret that as a normative statement about language, which it isn't,2
The term correctness conditions has been taken from Ideology, Power, and Linguistic Theory by Prof G,2
K,2
Pullum.,2
 This is not really a dilemma if you handle it well,2
You can definitely teach your kid English without having to choose between making her 'lose her roots' or 'grow up to ridicule'.For the first 7-8 years of my life, I was raised by my mother's parents,2
My grandfather knew English but no one else in the house did,2
Moreover, I grew up in Madhya Pradesh (a core Hindi state) in a Marathi household,2
My grandfather is a thoroughly self-made man, and can be counted on to understand the impact of tiny (dis)advantages early in life,2
Just like you, he recognized the importance of me learning English,2
Being the only English speaker in the house, he'd often talk to me in English, and encourage me to reply in English, helping me figure out the best way to frame reply,2
He was my go-to English resource,2
I also went to a school where the medium of instruction was English,2
However, that doesn't ensure anything in itself.Kids don't usually like to learn if they know they are being 'made' to learn stuff,2
He'd employ interesting techniques to ensure that I absorbed things without being consciously aware of them,2
When I was learning to walk, he'd make me count my footsteps in English as I climbed up the stairs,2
Mind you, all this happened when I was less than 6 years old, a period particularly facile for language acquisition,2
By the time I was 7, I could talk fairly comfortably in English for a non-native speaker, and since I grew up in a Hindi / Marathi household, I had native competence in the two languages.During all this, however, I was also reading Hindi (and occasionally Marathi) newspapers and books and comics and what not,2
When I grew slightly older and started staying with my parents, they subscribed to kid magazines (in India, they'd be stuff like Champak or Balhans) in both Hindi and English,2
By the time I was 8, I was reading Hindi translations of Mir publication books such as Fun with Maths and Physics,2
I grew up fluent in all three languages, and due to my exposure to books such as the one I just mentioned, I am luckily comfortable even with technical vocabulary in Hindi,2
So yes, it is completely possible to raise your kid in a way that she picks up English, but please don't let her grow up in a monolingual environment, thereby wasting the natural advantage that most people growing up in India get,2
Immerse her in English, Hindi, and other languages too if possible,2
She gets to learn them 'for free' and she will thank you later! :)My own personal plan is to have my kid grow up exposed to at least 4 languages.,2
 What to do is sometimes said in levity while making a reference to Indian English, with constructions like "What to do yaar?" [What should I do, dude / mate]In Hindi, kya karoon? (which would be the closest match to What to do?) can be a standalone construction,2
However, in English, What to do? is not grammatically correct as a standalone utterance,2
It does not have a tensed verb,2
The verb to do here is in the infinitive form, and in itself cannot complete the sentence,2
What to do is actually a subordinate noun clause, and would be perfectly fine if used that way,2
Eg,2
I didn't know what to do.English is actually particularly finicky in this regard,2
It requires tensed verbs and subjects almost all the time.,2
 This sentence is perfectly correct, and anyone who says otherwise has been a victim of wrong grammar advice and is now propagating the same,2
Unlike what some people would have you believe, the use of they as a semantically singular gender-neutral word is not a new phenomenon of English inspired by feminist movements,2
In fact, it goes back in history to Chaucer!And whoso fyndeth hym out of swich blame,They wol come up...Chaucer, The Pardoners PrologueHere's singular they from Shakespeare:There's not a man I meet but doth salute meAs if I were their well-acquainted friendShakespeare, The Comedy of Errors, Act IV, Scene 3 (1594)Now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight;And every one to rest themselves betake,Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.Shakespeare, The Rape of LucreceOr Jane Austen: Who makes you their condant? (Jane Austen, Emma)Or Lewis CarrollWhoever lives there, thought Alice, itll never do to come uponthem this size; why, I should frighten them out of their wits![...]If everybody minded their own business, the duchess said in ahoarse growl, the world would go round a deal faster than itdoes,2
Lewis Carroll, Alice in WonderlandOr Oscar Wilde...at the end of the season when everyone has practically saidwhatever they had to sayLady Bracknell in Oscar Wildes The Importance of Being EarnestWe could go on and on,2
Singular they is perfectly grammatical, and extremely and consistently well-attested in the English language for at least 700 years.Go ahead and use it,2
If anyone says it's wrong, ask them for evidence, because they don't know what they are talking about.,2
 But what I do believe is that being a virgin myself and having decided not to lose it before marriage ( yeah! that may sound alien, but that is true!) , I deserve to ask for a virgin girl,2
Well, deserve is a fairly loaded kind of word, and I don't think you necessarily deserve anything in such a case, so it'd be best to not approach the issue with a sense of entitlement,2
Your decision to not have sex before marriage is just thatyour decision,2
Others may not care,2
That's theirs.At an individual level, it is of course perfectly alright for you to want a wife who shares your ideals of pre-marital celibacy, just like it is alright for you to have a preference for blue eyes or long hair or dimples or short height or whatever succeeds in generating the right chemical cocktail in your body,2
As far as possible, we should try not to police people's liking / preferences.But when individual desires get fossilized and institutionalized, an innocuous preference turns into a much more malevolent societal prejudice.Take, for instance, the issue of sex selection in India,2
At an individual level, it's perfectly fine to want to have a boy and not a girl,2
A lot of countries allow couples to 'choose' the sex of their child and the sex ratio of these countries has remained healthy despite this freedom,2
One hopes that in a large sample of parents, there will be many who'd want to have a girl, and many who'd want to have a boy, and the numbers would even out,2
But in a country like India, the desire to have a male child has institutionalized itself to the extent that it is no longer possible to expect things to remain in a natural equilibrium,2
In a similar fashion, virginity has historically and traditionally been associated with arbitrary notions of purity,2
We know that women have been at the receiving end of long-term institutionalized prejudice, and glorification of virginity is just one face of this many-headed monster,2
Your ideal of pre-marital celibacy is likely a channelization of the same mindset.And so, coming back to your question,2
No, it's not really objectionable for you as an individual to want a virgin wife, but you should understand how your innocuous choice isn't necessarily innocuous in the larger scheme of things,2
And you should understand why most women would take offence at this 'requirement' of yours.[PS: Some commenters are accusing me of 'bashing' OP,2
I am struggling to find parts of the answer which do this,2
I think I tried to explain the reason OP's 'choice' may be considered objectionable by people,2
This is what OP asked in the first place,2
If he wanted people to agree with him no matter what, he should not have posted the question on a public forum.Furthermore, some commenters have accused me of giving a 'societal' perspective to an 'individual' question,2
Well, I wrote at the outset that, as an individual, OP has the right to choose what he wants, but that it is important for him to distinguish his choice from his entitlements and to also understand why others find his choice problematic.],2
 One of the basic concepts of Unicode is that it abstracts the concept of 'letters' or 'characters' as we understand them in everyday usage from their representation.As the Wikipedia page for Unicode explains: The notion of a code point is used for abstraction, to distinguish both:the number from an encoding as a sequence of bits, andthe abstract character from a particular graphical representation (glyph).This is because one may wish to make these distinctions:encode a particular code space in different ways, ordisplay a character via different glyphs.,2
 Last month, I got one of the nicest compliments I could have gotten as a human being.A guy pinged me one day and, after a small preamble, came out to me,2
He then said that he had told only a couple of friends so far and that I was probably the 4th or 5th person to know,2
Now, a bunch of people have come out to me prior to this, and it's not a big deal,2
But in this case, I was a bit surprised because I didn't know him,2
He is a junior from my university, but we have probably just met on a couple of occasions.I told him I was totally fine with it, and that he could trust me, but that I was curious why he had chosen to tell me despite not knowing me well,2
He replied that he had read my answers on Quora and the stuff that I write on my blogs and that I came off as a tolerant and rational person, and so he felt safe telling me what was probably the biggest secret of his life.Frankly speaking, this is one of the warmest compliments anyone can get.I wrote this in my answer to Interpersonal Interaction: How can I make myself more broad-minded?, and I'd reiterate it hereWe don't exist in a vacuum,2
We are a part of a complex society and our actions contribute to the overall health of the society,2
Everything we say and do, especially in public places and public forums, can have invisible but strong influences.If you are the sort of guy who makes homophobic remarks just to look cool, you are helping create an environment where gay folks feel scared and insecure,2
If you are someone who makes boorish remarks about women, it doesn't matter then that you think 'rapists should be hanged' or that you participated in candle-lights vigils after the Delhi gang rape,2
The truth is that you also ended up contributing to creating a negative environment for women,2
So don't be such a person,2
We don't need to put on a cape to help people,2
There are easier, more effective ways.[Thanks to Anasuya for 'editorial work'],2
 The idea of a new Star Trek television series excites me,3
Star Trek belongs on television not in the cinema.BUT..,3
I am concerned that the series will be produced by Alex Kurtzman, one of the producers and writers of the Abrams Star Trek films,3
I did enjoy the first of those films, but the second one is beyond embarrassing,3
Star Trek Into Darkness is not the product of people that understand Star Trek,3
It is not the product of people that understand story-telling.Kurtzman's television productions are a mixed bag,3
On the bright side, he is one of the people that gave us Fringe,3
But, on the other side, he is one of the people that brought us Scorpion.As a writer, he has written terrible scripts for Transformers and Amazing Spider-Man 2,3
Hopefully he will stay out of the writer's room.This new Star Trek television series will be the flagship of CBS All Access, the digital streaming service of CBS,3
To watch the series, people will have to subscribe to that service for around $6 a month,3
That means it won't merely be a product that CBS hopes will bring them profits, it will be something that can greatly affect their larger corporate plans,3
That means they will probably feel compelled to be involved in the show in an editorial way,3
That didn't work out to well last time,3
I would much rather a company like Netflix was producing the series,3
Netflix appears to be much more comfortable allowing creative people to tell their stories the way they want to tell them.I'm very curious to know what the concept will be,3
It won't be Captain Kirk and Mr,3
Spock,3
Will it be the Enterprise? Will it be a starship on a five year mission? Will it be set in interstellar space or will it be set on a planet or starbase?The series I would like to see would go back to Gene Roddenberry's initial inspiration,3
Gene Roddenberry saw Captain Kirk as a futuristic Horatio Hornblower,3
The Hornblower novels, by C.S,3
Forester, follow Horatio throughout his career - from midshipman to Admiral of the Fleet,3
I would like to see a series that followed a character throughout their Starfleet career, starting with their first assignment and leading to their first command,3
The perspective of the audience would change as that character climbed the ladder,3
We'd see adventures from below decks during the first season, rarely seeing the bridge or the captain, similar to the excellent Star Next: The Next Generation season 7 episode "Lower Decks".What I most don't want to see is dark rooms,3
If you have the energy to power a warp drive and a transporter, you have energy to turn the damn lights on,3
I want a show that is bright figuratively and literally.Star Trek is incredibly important to me,3
It is a fictional world that I crave to visit,3
It has influenced every facet of my life,3
I so much want more of it, but I don't want it to be soiled.,3
 Not sure where you got the idea that 17 km/s is the escape velocity of the solar system,3
The escape velocity decreased with distance as depicted in the above graph.The above graph also illustrates the gravity assists that Voyager 2 did at each gas planet,3
Voyager's mission was to visit each of those planets,3
In order to do so, it had to be be at the same location as each planet as Voyager moved outwards,3
That means very precise velocities were required,3
If Voyager had been significantly faster at Jupiter, it would never have approached Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune.,3
 There was one American onboard ISS on that day, NASA astronaut Frank Culbertson,3
Frank had been tasked with collecting medical data on the crew,3
When he called down to the ground to report that data over a privatized loop, the flight surgeon explained to him what had happened,3
The event had a personal connection to Frank,3
A friend and Naval Academy classmate was the airline pilot of the plane that hit the Pentagon.Soon after completing that conversation, the ISS passed over New York and Frank went to the window and captured photographs and video of the burning towers.,3
 I listen to:Doctor Who: Radio Free SkaroDoctor Who: PodshockDoctor Who: The Impossible GirlsWhos Talking: A Doctor Who PodcastMy preference for them is in that order,3
Radio Free Skaro is run by three Canadian guys,3
They are long-time Whovians and participate in Who conventions,3
It's the most professional of the four podcasts,3
Podshock is an American guy and a British guy,3
The Impossible Girls is interesting because it is all female,3
They often see the episodes from a very different perspective than I do,3
The downside is that a few of them have very annoying speech patterns, including chronic use of "like".,3
 The story doesn't explicitly say,3
Dickens wrote the story in 1842-1843 and it was published for the 1843 Christmas season,3
The only mention of time in the story is when Scrooge asks the Ghost of Christmas Present "Have you had many brothers, Spirit? and the Ghost responds More than eighteen hundred." Since we know there is a new Ghost of Christmas Present each year, we know the story takes place more than 1800 years after the birth of Christ.The easiest assumption is to assume the story takes place on Christmas Eve 1843,3
But, the epilogue narration tells us:"Scrooge was better than his word,3
He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father,3
He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world."That leaves us to either assume the omniscient narrator is referring to the future or the story takes place far enough in the past that Ebenezer could become a better man before the story was told.,3
 More than two dozen,3
From the 1901 silent film called Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost to the 2009 full CGI 3D Jim Carrey version, A Christmas Carol is adapted for film, television, and stage perennially.I believe that the best version is the 1984 version, starring George C,3
Scott, David Warner, Susannah York, Roger Rees, and Edward Woodward,3
In addition to the strong performances from such a stellar cast, it is the version that I believe is most true both to the spirit and the setting of the film,3
Every year, I read the book, see the play, and watch this version,3
I can almost recite it from memory.An Incomplete List of Film Adaptations of A Christmas Carol1901 Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost1910 A Christmas Carol1935 Scrooge1938 A Christmas Carol1949 The Christmas Carol1951 Scrooge1953 It's Never Too Late1954 A Christmas Carol1956 The Stingiest Man in Town1969 A Christmas Carol1970 Scrooge1971 A Christmas Carol Animated1978 A Christmas Carol1979 An American Christmas Carol1983 Mickey's Christmas Carol1984 A Christmas Carol1986 A Christmas Carol1988 Scrooged1992 The Muppet Christmas Carol1998 Ebenezer1999 A Christmas Carol2000 A Christmas Carol2001 Christmas Carol: The Movie2005 Chasing Christmas2009 A Christmas Carol2012 A Christmas CarolIf that looks like a lot of films, that list would be absolutely dwarfed by the number of episodes of television series that adapt A Christmas Carol,3
Everything from The Twilight Zone to Blackadder to Beavis & Butthead has put their spin on the classic story,3
It is such a perfect story that everyone wants to tell it.,3
 Umm, most recently he has been killing it on the funniest sitcom on television (Veep),3
He didn't turn from comedy,3
There is no point in his career when he only accepted serious roles.Early in his career, he was certainly best known for comedy, with hits like A Bit of Fry and Laurie, Blackadder, and The Young Ones,3
But, as far back as 1985's Plenty, starring Meryl Streep, he has done dramatic work,3
In 1993, he starred in a miniseries called All or Nothing at All as a conman addicted to gambling.While he was doing both comedy and drama on House, he did quite a bit of comedic side work, such as voicing the character of Dr,3
Cockroach PhD in several Dreamworks productions.,3
 You mean besides movies like Legend, Clue, Pass the Ammo, The Hunt for Red October, Oscar, Passed Away, Loaded Weapon 1, The Three Musketeers, The Shadow, Congo, Lover's Knot, McHale's Navy, Four Dogs Playing Poker, Sorted, Charlie's Angels, Scary Movie 2, The Scoundrel's Wife, Ritual, Kinsey, and Burke and Hare?And besides television like Wiseguy, It, Roseanne, Earth 2, The Naked Truth, Over the Top, Lexx: The Dark Zone, The Net, Martial Law, Rude Awakening, Attila, Family Affair, Monk, Will & Grace, Alice, Cranford, and Criminal Minds?He has certainly been very, very successful as a voice actor in animation, but he has also had a career in serious film and television that most actors would envy.Besides Rocky Horror, he is probably best know for playing Pennywise the clown in the Stephen King mini-series, It - a clown that is not child friendly.,3
 It's a great show,3
I've seen him in concert, twice - once in Napa and once in Houston,3
The first concert was after his album Let Them Talk and the second after his album Didn't It Rain.Hugh Laurie is a talented singer and musician and he's supported by the excellent Copper Bottom Band,3
He cycles back and forth between the guitar, piano, and just standing at the mic.Hugh is extremely knowledgeable about early American blues, jazz, and bluegrass,3
The concert is mostly those types of music and he accompanies the songs with interesting stories about the originators,3
His love for the art is evident and enthusiastic,3
He's not a stage hog,3
Everyone in his band gets their solo.There are quite a few videos from his concerts, on Youtube,3
I'm not sure if any of them are authorized, so I'm not embedding one, here.,3
 In the book, Mark takes up about half a page explaining what happened to his suit,3

Everyone in the audience saw that he was impaled by part of the antenna,3
Everyone in the audience can figure out that an impaled spacesuit leaks,3
No explanation was needed by going with the simplest explanation,3
It didn't change the story at all,3
It would have been silly to go with the same explanation as used in the novel.As for accuracy in the book, spacesuits with oxygenators like the one in the book don't exist,3

 They aren't painted white,3
There are a variety of colored surfaces, each functional.Most of the module surfaces are metallic,3
In the below picture we can see many metal panels,3
Those are meteor shields,3
Below those shields are thermal blankets and below the blankets is an aluminum hull.Most of the areas that appear white are not paint, but exposed thermal blanket (AKA beta cloth),3
Look closely at this picture and you can see the fabric,3
The beta cloth is white because white reflects heat.There are some surfaces and boxes with a white coating,3
That coating is white, again for thermal reasons,3
There are also some boxes with a black coating, also for thermal reasons,3
Those are boxes that we don't want to get cold.,3
 He already did,3
It ran for 13 episodes in 1966,3
They are on Youtube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...If the follow on question is - okay, but what about a new series? Well, in the current cartoon climate, that is unlikely,3
Currently, superhero cartoons are not purchased by networks like Cartoon Network unless they are toy sellers,3
Well received and viewed cartoons like Teen Titans and Green Lantern were cancelled not because of ratings, but simply because they were not resulting in toy sales.Captain America, solo, is not going to push as many toys as Captain America with the Avengers,3
Neither is Thor or Iron Man.,3
 I don't believe he is negative about the films,3
To the contrary, he has been quite positive,3
He has repeatedly praised Sam Mendes work as director on Spectre and Skyfall,3
He has repeatedly said how grateful he is for the quality of the script in Casino Royale that allowed him to be Bond, rather than just impersonate past Bonds.Any negative remarks he has made have been about the exhausting process of making the films,3
They are massive films that put a lot of pressure on the star,3
They are physically demanding films that strain the body - work on Spectre had to cease for a few weeks while he had knee surgery after an on-set injury,3
They are films that require a lot of travel, keeping him away from his family,3
He's just exhausted and wants a break.There are two things that have to be understood to understand the context of his remarks:1) Craig is English,3
Sarcasm is as essential as breathing, for him,3
One has to understand sarcasm to understand his remarks.2) He doesn't enjoy spending hour after hour with stupid journalist after stupid journalist,3
These big movies require press events where the actors sit in a hotel suite while journalist after journalist is put in front of them and given a few minutes to ask the same idiotic questions the last forty stupid journalists asked,3
Going through an experience like that makes one lose track of how many different people are asking the questions,3
It starts to feel like the same person is asking the same question,3
Imagine that instead of talking about the current film, you were getting asked over and over if you want to make another one,3
Wouldn't you eventually try to make it stop by using hyperbole and saying something like "I'd rather cut my wrists with this bottle!" I sure as hell would,3
Look at this clip,3
Wouldn't you want to throw this journalist through a window?https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sj...The same thing happens here on Quora - on a much smaller scale - We get asked the same questions over and over and over,3
That sometimes results in using a little sarcasm and hyperbole, hoping it will stop the nonsense.,3
 The cast had been playing those roles for 15 years,3
They knew their characters,3
They were protective of those characters,3
They knew what makes Star Trek,3
Stuart Baird had never seen an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation,3
He didn't know the world,3
He didn't know the characters.That created friction whenever Baird required the actors to do something their characters wouldn't do.Star Trek: Nemesis doesn't feel like Star Trek,3
The characters are not true to their fifteen years of history,3
It's a bad film,3
It was not a fitting sendoff for the actors and they know that.,3
 The orange suits (affectionately called pumpkin suits) are not spacesuits,3
They are worn only while inside a vehicle that is ascending or descending through the atmosphere,3
Their primary purpose is to protect the crew member from the adverse effects of a depressurization inside the vehicle,3
They are orange because orange creates a high contrast against the background for rescue crews looking for the crew members in the water or on land.The current white suits are spacesuits,3
They are designed for use outside the vehicle, in the vacuum of space,3
They are designed to provide a pressurized environment, thermal control, and protection against tears and punctures.,3
 The last twenty minutes of the film were all about trying to match the velocity and position of the Hermes with the velocity and position of the MAV,3
The crew of the Hermes had to go to extreme lengths to try to get themselves closer to the MAV.The MAV was designed to transport the crew from the Martian surface to Mars orbit where it would rendezvous with the Hermes,3
The problem during the last twenty minutes of the film is that the trajectory that returned the Hermes to Mars was not low or slow enough for the MAV to reach,3
The Hermes was not entering a parking orbit, it was doing a high speed loop around Mars and then back to Earth.Therefore, the objective on the ground was for Watney to reduce the mass of the MAV so that it could reach a greater altitude and higher speed.,3
 Yes, there are several cosmonauts and astronauts that resided on both Mir and the ISS.CosmonautsNikolai BudarinMir EO-19 (June - September 1995)Mir EO-25 (January - August 1998)ISS Exp 6 (November 2002 - May 2003)Vladimir DezhorovMir EO-18 (March - July 1995)ISS Exp 3 (August - December 2001)Aleksandr KaleriMir EO-11 (March - August 1992)Mir EO-22 (August 1996 - March 1997)Mir EO-28 (April - June 2000)ISS Exp 8 (October 2003 - April 2004)ISS Exp 25/26 (October 2010 - March 2011)Sergei KrikalevMir EO-4 (November 1988 - April 1989)Mir EO-9 (May - October 1991)Mir EO-10 (October 1991 - March 1992)ISS Exp 1 (October 2000 - March 2001)ISS Exp 11 (April - October 2005)Yuri MalenchenkoMir EO-16 (July - November 1994)ISS Exp 7 (April - October 2003)ISS Exp 16 (October 2007 - April 2008)ISS Exp 32/33 (July - November 2012)Yuri OnufrienkoMir EO-21 (February - September 1996)ISS Exp 4 (December 2001 - June 2002)Gennady PadalkaMir EO-26 (August 1998 - February 1999)ISS Exp 9 (April - October 2004)ISS Exp 19/20 (March - October 2009)ISS Exp 31/32 (May - September 2012)ISS Exp 43/44 (March - September 2015)Yuri UsachovMir EO-15 (January - July 1994)Mir EO-21 (February - September 1996)ISS Exp 2 (March - August 2001)Pavel VinogradovMir EO-24 (August 1997 - February 1998)ISS Exp 13 (March - September 2006)ISS Exp 35/36 (March - September 2013)AstronautsMichael FoaleMir EO-23/24 (May - October 1997)ISS Exp 8 (October 2003 - April 2004)In addition, there are astronauts and cosmonauts that did not reside on both, but resided on one and visited the other or visited both space stations, including: Leopold Eyharts, Dave Wolf, Chris Hadfield, Linda Godwin, Wendy Lawrence, Ed Lu, Bill McArthur, Andy Thomas, Jim Wetherbee, Terry Wilcutt, Carlos Noriega, James Reilly, Peter Wisoff, Jerry Ross, Dominic Gorie, Thomas Reiter, James Halsall, Salizhan Sharipov, Franklin Chang-Diaz, Eileen Collins, Janet Kavandi, Marsha Ivins, Brent Jett, Scott Parazynski, and Carl Walz.,3
 The special, titled The Day of the Doctor, was simulcast in 94 countries across six continents, in 15 languages,3
While that has been done for realtime events like the World Cup, it had never been done for a television drama.The special was also shown live in 1500 cinemas,3
I had the pleasure of being at the largest single gathering of fans to watch it,3
2200 of us congregated in one room to watch it live at Austin Comic Con.That's not the only Guinness World Record that Doctor Who holds,3
It was also recently recorded as the longest running sci-fi series.,3
 I can't imagine any other actor portraying Steve Rogers and Captain America with such verisimilitude.From the his first scene, we can see the determination, goodness, and spirit in the scrawny kid from Brooklyn,3
When Dr,3
Erskine says to Steve, "The serum amplifies everything that is inside,3
So, good becomes great,3
Bad becomes worse,3
This is why you were chosen,3
Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power,3
But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.""Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing,3
That you must stay who you are,3
Not a perfect soldier, but a good man."We buy it, because Evans has so convinced us that this kid is the right person to become Captain America.And then we see Steve step out of the chamber, transformed and bare chested,3
Evans has the physicality that looks like he stepped out of the comic book page.Evans brings Cap's earnestness, sadness, integrity, and bravery to life without a hint of irony or cheese.,3
 There are two wolves who are always fighting.One is darkness and despair.The other is light and hope.The question is: which wolf wins?The one you feed.Casey learned that old Indian legend from her father,3
She repeats it throughout the film,3
It is the central idea of the story,3
She and Athena are driven by that idea,3
Young Frank was, but adult Frank has started to feed the wrong wolf and Casey has to bring him back,3
Nix has been corrupted by his obsession with the wrong wolf.If we want a bright future, we have to see a bright future,3
We have to feed that future,3
The film has a couple of small jokes about movies with apocalyptic titles,3
The film isn't saying that such movies are bad, but it is saying that if all of our visions of the future are dystopian, how can we expect a future that isn't dystopian? We need to see the future we want - we need to see Tomorrowland.The film is about optimism and the wonderful things we can do, if we believe we can do them,3
There's a common refrain about the present in which people say "Where are the jetpacks and flying cars we were promised?" In the film, young Frank says "I got tired of waiting for my jetpack, so I built one."Walt Disney believed in projecting the future he wanted to see,3
He built Tomorrowland, at Disneyland, to be an exciting, positive view of what can be,3
Walt's dream, was to actually build the city of the future,3
He bought all of that land in Florida not just to build Disneyworld but to build a city called EPCOT (Experimental Protoype City of Tomorrow),3
At the center of that city would be research facilities for all of the major companies in America,3
It would be a city dedicated to the future,3
Unfortunately Walt died before ground was broken and the project faded away.,3
 If an actor starves themselves for months and becomes emaciated, for a single scene, they sure as hell aren't going to have a towel over their head for that scene,3
They are going to make sure you know it is them.The Martian was filmed on a very short schedule,3
There wasn't time for a hiatus while the lead actor starved himself.Matt may have been willing to lose weight for the role, but he's in his forties now,3
It would be a lot harder than it was when he did it for Courage Under Fire,3
Doing it for that film seriously affected his health,3
He was on medication for 18 months because of the damage caused to his adrenal system.,3
 White wine was very common for the ancient Sumerians, Egyptians, Romans, and Greeks,3
Atheneus wrote of the excellent white wine from Alexandria,3
Several years ago, evidence of white wine was found in King Tut's tomb.The Greek Retsina, still popular today, has been a staple for over two-thousand years,3
The island of Santorini built its fame on white wines made from athiri and aidini grapes as far back as Neolithic times.Homer's Odyssey refers to straw wine - a white wine made from dehydrated grapes.There are many mentions of white Falernian wine in Roman literature,3
Pliny mentions it several times, including talking about it being served at a banquet for Julius Caesar.,3
 Because the Marvel Cinematic Universe is inspired by the Marvel Comics Universe, and in the comics, more money can be made by going with choice (A) than choice (B).Choice A: sell the following comics each month:Iron ManCaptain AmericaThorBlack WidowHawkeyeIncredible HulkThe AvengersChoice B: sell the following comics each month:The AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersThe AvengersI believe the same would apply to the films.This is a very common question from people that aren't more than casual comic book fans,3
They often ask things like"Why didn't Iron Man help Captain America when SHIELD was after him in Captain America: The Winter Soldier?" or "Why didn't the Avengers help Spider-man save New York in Spider-Island?" The answer is "Because it's not their &@$*ing movie/comic!"If every time Batman got into trouble, he called Superman, Wonder Woman, or the Flash to bail him out, Batman would cease to be an interesting hero,3
The title character needs to be the hero of their title.It's not about reality, it's about telling good stories.,3
 There are two things to talk about, here: continuity and creative teams.ContinuityContinuity is a mixed blessing,3
It is essential to world-building and creating the serial aspect of comics that keeps the industry alive,3
The industry depends on those fans that purchase multiple titles every month because they don't want to miss out on a stitch of the tapestry,3
But, it is also a stifling burden, that constricts creators more and more each year,3
Superman and Batman have appeared in comic books every month for the last 75 years,3
Many of the Marvel characters are entering their fifth decade of publication,3
During that time, these characters have been kept in a recycling status quo,3
Both Marvel and DC utilize floating timelines that maintain that all of the stories have occurred in the last 10 years,3
These characters are worth more as licensing properties than as comic book characters,3
That means that they can't really change.Imagine you are a comic book writer,3
Your job is to write interesting stories that will captivate audiences and sell books,3
You are restricted in how much you can change about the characters,3
You also have to deal with the massive history of the characters,3
How do you write a Batman versus Joker story that is in continuity with every other Batman versus Joker story told in the last 75 years? That's hundreds of stories,3
How do you even maintain the plausibility that Batman would return the Joker to Arkham over and over and over again, knowing the Joker will escape and kill innocents?"Continuity holds the best writer hostage of the worst." - Marv Wolfman (writer of Crisis on Infinite Earths)"Continuity is the devil,3
Continuity is the devil! Its awful,3
It makes for bad stories, right? Because suddenly, well, wait a second, you said Wolverine hates ham sandwiches, hes clearly eating a ham sandwich! Thats trivia,3
 But consistencys important,3
Like with what Dan said, its about truth to character,3
The rest is ultimately trivia, and time isnt really time in comics, you know?" - Matt Fraction (writer of Hawkeye)The nice thing about coming in to write the New 52 is I dont have to worry about what came before the New 52,3
That stuff is great and it can serve as inspiration, but continuity is the devil,3
As a writer, having to slavishly make sense of too much continuity can kill a story,3
Yes, you want to stay true to the spirit of things, and continuity can absolutely be your friend in creating resonance and a sense of history and paying off certain emotional things  but: It was a beautiful, beautiful thing for me walking into the New 52 and being able to look at a small range of stories that had been told, and those are the things that are set in stone, and the rest of it we can make up as we go,3
We can build the stories that make sense for our characters in order to tell the emotional story that were telling,3
- Greg Pak (writer of World War Hulk)It is the editor's job to govern continuity,3
They have to balance ensuring the story fits into the ongoing universe of the comics with allowing creators to tell their best stories,3
Judgement calls have to be made,3
Not everything in the last 75 years was good,3
Mistakes were made, bad stories were written,3
Is it okay for a writer in 2015 to contradict a bad and forgotten story from 1973? Or must every writer in perpetuity be constrained by the choices of that long ago writer? Creative TeamsThe crux of your question is about having multiple writers work on characters,3
Believe it or not, it is often more desirable to a publisher to have a creator on a title for a short period than a long period,3
Ultimately, comics is a business,3
It is their job to try to sell more books this month than last month,3
One thing that is almost guaranteed to cause an increase in sales is a change in creative team,3
Put "New Creative Team!" On the cover in giant font and people that didn't buy the book last month will buy it this month,3
Readers often say it is difficult to know when to jump into a book,3
Readers also become complacent and bored,3
That's why publishers like to remember so often,3
Putting an "Issue #1" or "First Issue" on the cover tells people - "start here!"There are, of course, exceptions,3
There are star writers whose names sell books,3
Marvel will let Brian M,3
Bendis stay on a book as long as he wants to, just as DC will for Geoff Johns.Often, the change is not a choice of the publisher,3
Writers come onto a book with a plan for the story or stories they want to tell,3
When that is done, they want to move on,3
They want to do other things,3
They may only have one six issue story about Spider-man to tell,3
Then they want to tell their six-issue story about Batman.And finally, characters like Spider-man, Batman, Superman, and Wolverine can support multiple titles a month,3
So, in a given month, by necessity, one writer will be using Batman in Batman and another will be using him in Detective Comics, and a third in Justice League.,3
 I moved to India in 2008 for more treatment and options for my health,4
If you don't know what happened to me, I suggest you read: Virali Modi's answer to What does it feel like to survive death?.In 2008, I weighed 75kgs, I was paralyzed from my chest down,4
I had some movement in my arms, but they weren't strong enough for me to be completely independent,4
My mom and I moved to India, leaving my father behind in America (so he could provide financial stability),4
It was incredibly difficult leaving behind the United States and of course my father,4
What made it even more difficult is the fact that I didn't know Hindi (a widely spoken language), I could only understand it,4
The only languages I knew were English and Gujarati (my mother tongue).On top of that, when we landed in Mumbai, the next day, we took a train to Delhi for an ayurvedic treatment,4
This treatment required my mom and I to stay there for a month (coincidentally, my birthday month),4
I was given digusting medicines to drink and pills to swallow, oil massages in which I couldn't shower for a couple of days, and head massages which left my hair oily and gross looking,4
I was also put on a strict diet which, in retrospect, wasn't really healthy,4
