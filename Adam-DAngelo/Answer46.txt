 Adam D'AngeloWhile I was in college I made a prototype of a chat website. I wrote the long polling server in Erlang because it seemed like the ideal language for the task and also as a chance to have fun learning a new language.I then worked on the initial Facebook chat prototype as part of a hackathon project in early 2007, along with Rebekah Cox and Ari Steinberg. I reused some of the Erlang code from my personal project. When we decided to make it an official project and productionalize the server code, the team decided to stick with Erlang and took over the code from there.The rationale was something like:We already have a working prototype to start from.Erlang is good at holding a ton of open connections, which is the hardest part of a chat service.Erlang is easy to learn, even though very few engineers already know it.The last point, lack of expertise, is a real weakness of the language, but it was outweighed by other factors at the time. Ultimately it contributed to Facebook's decision to move the service to C++, though even with the knowledge that it would eventually be rewritten, I think it was the right choice for the initial version because of the limited resources we had at the time. It was probably also the right choice for WhatsApp for the same reason.See Ben Maurer's answer to When did Facebook switch away from using Erlang for Facebook Chat? for more details about why Facebook later switched.
