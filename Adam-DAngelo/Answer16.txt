 Adam D'AngeloI think there are a few reasons behind this:Distribution mechanisms reward short content. The content that gets the most social sharing tends to be short, like the length of a news article, because a high percentage of the people who click to read it end up finishing it and sharing it. As far as Facebook is concerned any like is the same as any other like - they can't tell that you really really liked something and so it should be broadcast more widely despite the fact that fewer people per impression liked it than the number that like a news story.Also, no one searches for fiction - you can't think of the name of what you want to read without having heard of it already. And stories don't link to each other, so there is no discovery through the content itself.Reading interfaces aren't appropriate for long content. If you're reading something long you want to be able to have some way to hold your place that won't be lost if you navigate away, and have that shared across devices. Today if you click a link on Twitter on your phone the site you click to has no information about your identity and so it can't store your place for you to pick up later (plus it may be thrown away if you switch to another app and your phone needs memory).Fiction doesn't do well in very short form, since characters and storylines need to be developed from scratch. (The one case where this isn't true is fan fiction, which does reasonably well on the internet.)There are some places where fiction works which solve distribution, like Amazon/Kindle and Wattpad. But they aren't integrated into the rest of the internet because of the issues above.
