 Adam D'AngeloAccording to Governing the Commons, most "long-enduring" institutions that manage common pool resources have the following design principles. Think of an organization that controls access to people fishing in a lake with a scarce amount of fish as an example. There will usually be:Clearly defined boundaries (it's clear what resources are governed by the institution, and its clear how many resources each person is allowed to take)Congruence between appropriation and provision rules and local conditions (for example, if the resource is a forest and its timber, you might not be allowed to cut younger trees that haven't had a chance to grow yet - basically rules are adapted to the local conditions)Collective-choice arrangements (most people affected by the rules can participated in getting them changed or getting exceptions made)Monitoring (there are people who monitor the rules, who are accountable back to everyone)Graduated sanctions (people who break the rules face sanctions proportional to the severity of the offense)Conflict-resolution mechanisms (there are easy ways to resolve conflicts between people or between people and the officials)Minimal recognition of rights to organize (a higher authority like the state doesn't interfere with the institution)Nested enterprises when appropriate (for especially complicated institutions, there are nested layers of rules/enforcement/conflict resolution)
