 Adam D'AngeloAn investor will agree to a higher valuation with a liquidation preference than without one. And the company is usually better off with the higher valuation and the preference than a lower valuation and no preference.The root of this is asymmetric information between the investors and the founders who will control the company. Especially in early stage investing, much of the value of the company is in the commitments the founders are making, and they usually know much more about the market they are in than the investors. This creates an opportunity for some founders to exaggerate their commitments, inflate the potential of the company, and raise money at a valuation higher than what they know is right given their information.The real issue comes after raising the round: the founders can decide to shut down the company and distribute the cash equally to all shareholders. If the investors put in $3M at a $9M post-money valuation, they own 1/3 of the company so they only get $1M back. The founders get $2M without having had to do anything aside from sell a vision and represent that the company had a lot of potential.Most founders have no interest in shutting down their company, but investors may not be able to tell whether that is true or not for a particular company. Agreeing to a liquidation preference is a way to confirm to the investors that this is not your intent, which gives them more comfort with a higher valuation.Note that the logic above applies best to very early stage companies that are all potential which don't have many current assets. If there is already a lot of value in the user-base or the business of the company then shutting it down would not be in the interest of the founders.However, for later stage companies there is a general understanding that having a down round and the resulting overhang of a big preference stack is very costly to the company, so agreeing to a liquidation preference is still a way to signal to investors that the company is confident that the valuation being given is reasonable.Personally, I think the signaling value created by agreeing to a preference (which carries information that the founders are committed, and that the valuation is reasonable) is actually greater than the "downside protection" value which is typically discussed and modeled.The value of the downside protection is limited for good investors because companies don't usually end up worth both more than the size of the investment and less than the valuation, and because the investors' opportunity cost of capital used in the investment would be to invest it in other companies, where it might grow 15-20%/year. So getting back just the initial investment after 5 years is not too much different from getting back the fraction of that they'd get without the preference.I'm not saying the downside protection is worthless, it's just not as valuable as people make it out to be. To me, most of the value is in the signal carried by the fact that the company is agreeing to the preference, and that they wouldn't if they knew the valuation was unlikely to be higher in later rounds.This assumes the founders/board have thought through all this, but I would argue that they usually have: the corporate counsel should provide this guidance, and the board often has earlier-stage investors who have seen these things play out. It definitely is not always true, but I would guess that in most of the "unicorn" funding rounds today it is true.
