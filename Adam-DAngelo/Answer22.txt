 Adam D'AngeloInstagram makes money through ads paid for by advertisers. They are currently only working with a small group of larger advertisers:Were starting slow with advertising to make sure we take time to get the experience right for our ad partners and the Instagram community. Well let you know when were ready to expand to more ad partners.(from: How do I advertise on Instagram?)This article projected Instagram would make $700M this year, growing to $5.8B in 2020:Instagram revenue projected to hit $5.8 billion in 2020, analyst saysI have no inside information, but I think these estimates are reasonable, at least toward the later years. Instagram has more usage than Twitter today, and Twitter made $1.4B in revenue in 2014. Usage will probably double over the next five years, and monetization will get better and better.They also can benefit from Facebook's ad sales and ad targeting. This may mean that some of this revenue results in lower Facebook revenue from other products, but I expect that the vast majority will be net positive.
