  Michael Jackson said  "That to give someone a piece of your heart  is worth more than all the wealth in the world." Bhavesh has certainly given us a piece of his heart. My great grandmother was a very industrious  hard-working farmer's wife. She was quite old-school in many ways and light years ahead of her time in many other ways. She would speak about "quality" people. If great grandma said that someone was quality (and not many people were bestowed with this mark) we knew that she thought of them in the highest regard  and that we should  too.
