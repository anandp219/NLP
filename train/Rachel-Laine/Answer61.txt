  I'm probably letting my inner anti-fun curmudgeon show  but I find those large  overhead DVD players installed in SUV's really distracting and irritating. When I'm tired and sitting in bumper-to-bumper rush hour traffic and I end up behind a vehicle with one or more screens overhead in the backseat(s) playing cartoons or children's movies it's very difficult to keep my eyes from being drawn to the constantly flashing lights. Especially when I need to be concentrating on brake lights that may be directly in front of that vehicle.
