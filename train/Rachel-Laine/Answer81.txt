This isn't the case. Certainly not for all employers.The transition from college to your first job is difficult and it's even more difficult when you feel as though others are lapping you on the track. It's normal to feel anxious and nervous -- this is what you have spent the last four or five years of your life preparing for  after all. It sounds like you were an excellent student. If I were you I would spend an equivalent amount of effort "studying" - practicing and researching - to look for a job.
