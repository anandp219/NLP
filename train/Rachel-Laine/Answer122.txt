Ignoring the energy invested in presenting your best self and opening yourself up to a new person  rejecting someone is actually a very difficult and stressful thing to do. While it's not necessarily the best choice  your dates might ignore your texts because it's a lot easier than telling you that they didn't enjoy your company enough to want more of it - even another piece of that coveted free tilapia. It's an extremely difficult thing to do  but try thinking about why these women might not have connected with you enough to accept your offer for a second date.
