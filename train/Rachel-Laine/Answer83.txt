But there is good news.It's highly likely that your potential date is suffering from this same syndrome. That she picks at her own so-called flaws and worries that her legs aren't shapely enough or that she has a bit of a muffin top or that her cheeks are a bit too round. Or maybe it's that she has too many freckles or that her hair is too wavy or too curly or that her skin isn't clear enough. Either way  why is someone else's suffering good news? How is that possible? Because it's quite likely that she isn't picking you apart in her mind at all - she's thinking about her own self-perceived flaws just like you're thinking about your own flaws.
