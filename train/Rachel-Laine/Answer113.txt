  I was 8 years old when I first visited the orthodontist. Either my mother truly didn't know or she just didn't have the heart to tell me  that I would be seeing a whole lot of the man over the next 10 years. I remember sitting in his office that day  staring down at my well-worn Keds and then up at all of his diplomas  as he explained to my mother that my case was  "very interesting." That is orthodontist code for  "You're going to wear a hideous  torturous contraption in your ugly mouth FOOOREEEEVER."
