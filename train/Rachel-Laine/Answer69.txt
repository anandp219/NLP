Almost all companies offer more benefits than any one person can take advantage of simply because they design benefits to attract many types of people. Many employers also offer a paid sabbatical which is a benefit that you do not need to be a new or expecting parent to utilize. So some companies do offer a somewhat comparable benefit. Even if your company does not offer a sabbatical  you might still come out ahead in the endurance race. Sometimes new parents who take long leaves or vacations are overlooked for promotions or raises  depending on the company culture.
