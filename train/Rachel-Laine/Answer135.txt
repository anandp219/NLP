  I was 7 years old the first time that I heard the phrase "old soul". I was confused about what it meant then and  admittedly  I'm still a little confused. My bighearted Midwestern mother  who loves any excuse for a get-together or a potluck  convinced me that I would love a big sleepover party for my birthday. I knew better  of course  but I got swept up in the magic and excitement of the matching My Little Pony paper plates and pink streamers and the anticipation of cake and presents dancing in my head.
