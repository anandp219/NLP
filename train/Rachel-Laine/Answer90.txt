Placing people in awkward situations is never a good way to win friends. Think long term. Not tonight's dinner. It's really painful to go home by yourself and feel the brutal sting of exclusion when you know that everyone is having a fabulous time at dinner. Is your end goal to form real  lasting friendships or to join in on one dinner? Forming friendships takes time and it's highly likely that if you become friends with a few people in the group that they will include you in the larger group activities.
