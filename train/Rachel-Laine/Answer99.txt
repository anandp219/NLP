You don't generally take a dinner cruise to get from point A to point B  you take a dinner cruise for the boat ride  the scenery  and the meal. And  sometimes  because it's a work obligation. The wine train works pretty much the same way. Scenery  food  and train ride (the meal is pretty good  btw).A car is your wine country best bet. Take turns being designated driver and mix it up now and then with bike rentals  a tour/hired driver  and the wine train.
