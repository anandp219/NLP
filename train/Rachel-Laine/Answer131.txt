Growing up is actually pretty hard and all sorts of uncomfortable and awkward. Maybe I was just particularly behind the curve  but I had to learn a lot in college and only a small percentage of that was from a textbook. I realize now that college is a wonderful  insular environment in which to do that kind of learning. But hey  it's very possible that you're absolutely nothing like me and that you have nothing to discover or learn about yourself. I suppose that some people just have their stuff together (wait - don't most people think that they are one of those people?).
