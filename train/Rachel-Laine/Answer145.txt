Let's check it out:One great way to make friends is to volunteer doing something that you love and are passionate about. Let's say  for giggles  that you are passionate about animals. Volunteer at a horse rescue or an animal shelter. You will be doing something that you love  donating your time to a great cause  and meeting like-minded potential friends. Even if they don't become friends  you will still have a great time doing something for a great cause  AND you get that shiny star for your college app.
