Remember that these are not your parents goals  they are your goals. Where do you want to go to college and what do you want to do after college? Which school will help you achieve your goals and reach your dreams? If you don't know  do some research. You could even ask here on Quora. Sometimes we have to work hard to create our own happiness in the short term for the sake of our long term goals.
