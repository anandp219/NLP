This is a great way to have fun  meet new people  and learn something too. I really encourage you to look into this. Even if many of the members of the book club are older than you are -- you might find a "mentor" which is really important. Mentors are important as you are thinking about colleges and careers. Also consider attending readings at local bookstores by famous authors. You should be able to find a calendar of events online. If you would like to meet more people at your school  consider trying out for a play!
