  Because you are not currently enrolled in a graduate counseling program  your options will be limited. I believe that you are eligible to volunteer at a crisis hotline without any credential or school enrollment. You might also consider applying for a position in a larger counseling office. Even if you are answering phones and scheduling appointments and not doing any actual counseling work  you will get a much better feel for what it is like to work in the field. If you haven't already done so  I strongly urge you to go through the therapy process yourself.
