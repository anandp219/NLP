  Mothers are among the toughest in the lot of family and friends to choose gifts for. Likely because we desire to give our mothers something great that they will love - and that's absolutely no easy task. When I first start to think about a gift for my mother or a mother  I ponder a few preliminary questions: Does she need things? Does she need things for her home or for her wardrobe? Does she not need anything for her home/wardrobe/gardening? How well do I know her? How well do I know her taste?
