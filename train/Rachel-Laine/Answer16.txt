You mention that you are thinking about things like the consequences of leading people on and the difference between chemistry and deeper love. You also mention that you are thinking about things like being vulnerable and physicality and where you are in life. These are all excellent things to think about and I wish that I had thought more deeply about them earlier on in my life. So how do you move on? It seems to me like you are. You are thinking about what went wrong in this relationship  about yourself and who you are  and what you might want in your next relationship/from your life and that's a pretty darn decent step in the right direction.
