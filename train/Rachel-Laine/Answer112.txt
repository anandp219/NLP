We choose to have some level of crime. The government already has the ability to listen in to every phone call  text message  email  tweet  pin  Quora questions  and so on -- if they need more than that to prosecute  perhaps we either need better prosecutors or this is the intersection at which we find the level of "tolerable crime".A weaker point is the "criminals will always have guns" take. In other words  if we deny encryption to the general populace it will not prevent the use of encryption by the criminal element.
