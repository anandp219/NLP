When party day finally came  my My Little Pony dreams disintegrated into my worst nightmare of 15 little girls running quickly and wildly around my house  shrieking in high-pitched tones  and playing schoolyard teasing games.My mom was right  sort of. My friends were loving the birthday party. Their joy was abundantly obvious and barely containable. I was the only one not enjoying the party. I slunk upstairs to my bedroom and plopped down on my bunk with despair and that's where my mom and I had the old soul conversation while inertia kept everything going downstairs.
