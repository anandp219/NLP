  If you want to pursue a friendship with this person  you might be happier if begin by choosing activities that are lighter on conversation and heavier on experiences. Select activities that don't emphasize conversation  but allow the two of you to build a shared history that will eventually give you things to talk about other than television. Take a yoga class together  for example  or go to a concert. Trivia nights are another option or paint nights. There are a lot of possibilities. There are plenty of reasons why someone might focus on discussing non-personal things or might not feel comfortable disclosing personal things in the early stages of a friendship.
