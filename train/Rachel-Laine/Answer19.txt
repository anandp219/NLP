Because I didn't receive such a primer  I will take this opportunity to share a few bites of programmer dating wisdom.Is that a GPS in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?If you are going to love a programmer  you need to embrace quirks and the unconventional and the plain ol' strange and weird. Not even just embrace  but love. I learned this very early on with J. On our first date J greeted me at the restaurant with an awkward hug and I felt a large bulge in his pocket. That's alright  I thought... Everyone has their  um  moments?
