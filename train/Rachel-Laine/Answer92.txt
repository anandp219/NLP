  I am an introvert who occasionally dresses up as an extrovert. Like most things in moderation - exercise  trashy television  tourist attractions  Starbucks holiday drinks - I enjoy socializing in moderate amounts. Over the years and through some disastrous social experiences  I have learned that if I am going to continue to enjoy socializing I need to take steps to set myself up for success. For me  and I suspect for other reserved introverts out there  this means not volunteering to be part of the welcoming committee and the unofficial ice-breaking crew at parties.
