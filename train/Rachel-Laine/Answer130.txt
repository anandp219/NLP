I struggled a lot (understatement) during that time in my life and I mistakenly assumed that I was miserable because I did not get to make any real choices for myself. It was college or college.I was directionless and bitter and I chose to behave like a petulant toddler for quite a few years. I drifted in and out of majors and various mischievous antics. I finally graduated six years and six years of summer courses later (and a few sternly worded emails from my parents). Years later when I had settled into a job and a life and into my own skin  I realized that my malcontent during my college years wasn't owed to being forced to go to college - it was owed to having to grow up.
