As a society  we collectively upvote gossip more than 3 billion times a year. Gossip has many times more followers than D'Angelo and Bodnick combined. Where does this leave us? We can be relatively certain that people will gossip about us throughout our lives (vicious or otherwise) and it is prudent to tailor our coping strategies accordingly.When I first learned about this thing we call gossip -- the first time I heard some nasty untruths about me floating around in the ether -- I was quite young.
