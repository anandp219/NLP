  Wine country is mostly rural  agriculture country. Wine grapes are a crop  after all. While Napa Valley is a relaxing and picturesque place to unwind with a glass of cab franc  it lacks the urban density that makes jetting around on a bike or public transport super easy and convenient. So long as you plan to have a designated driver  a car will get you everywhere that you need to go.Many of the budget hotels ($250 dollars/night) offered on popular online travel deal sites are not in the town of Napa proper but in adjacent towns like American Canyon.
