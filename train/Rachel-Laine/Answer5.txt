If you were giving a sales pitch to potentially very important clients  but didn't appear to have tried to learn their names it might not reflect well. If someone you really looked up to or admired couldn't remember your name you might feel a little hurt - as if they didn't care about you. I think  generally speaking  people care how they are received by others and sometimes the little things like remembering names aren't so little.
