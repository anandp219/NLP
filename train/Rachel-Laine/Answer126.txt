If so  you might both end up unhappy and bitter...and not friends. Think about your expectations and whether or not she can realistically fulfill them.You are both going through major  life-changing events. If asking her to be a bridesmaid isn't the best fit right now because you sense that it would be too much of a time commitment  maybe you could ask her to do a reading at the wedding or to participate in some other way. You might also consider asking her how you can best support her right now.
