They might feel as if you are saying to them personally  "you're doing a bad job". With this in mind  when I do offer suggestions  I do not share them with coworkers and I prefer to submit them anonymously. Let's say that I'm making a suggestion about the annual holiday party. Even if I'm not speaking directly with someone on the holiday party committee  both viruses and gossip spread pretty quickly around offices. When I give feedback I choose to limit myself to my top few suggestions because I don't want my employer or whomever it might be to mistakenly assume that I am not happy or disgruntled.
