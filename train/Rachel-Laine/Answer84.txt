  It is sort of fun to play around with the idea of what life might be like if we didn't care what other people thought about us. I might cut to the front of the coffee line to shave a cool 10 minutes off of my morning routine. Uncaffeinated people are pretty surly and unpredictable when they are angry though. Hmm... so maybe scratch that. If I'm not interested in what anyone thinks  I could dominate the conversation and only ever talk about myself and my life obsessively with friends. Do I care if they stop calling?
