  I am a big fan of find by doing. Live  with integrity  a little longer  and it will dawn on you that one of the things that you are good at  and one of things the world needs  and one of things that you enjoy the most  all overlap into one most obvious thing. Meanwhile  I am also a big fan of Les Mattheson's finding who you are through living your values. Perhaps you don't find your function  so much as it finds you. While you are doing this living  waking up to your true self  what can you do to become more comfortable with the search  more reassured of the right track  and intellectually affirmed?
