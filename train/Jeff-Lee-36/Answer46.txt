  Your remorse to us on Quora is not what really counts. I can only hope that you have not permanently jeopardized your relationship with your son. You should make every attempt to apologize for a massive overreaction. The possibility of him being suicidal is still a realistic concern. He needs to know that there are no qualifications to your love for him  that he could commit murder and you are the one person on the planet in whom he can count on for support. If you believe in God  then  hopefully you can understand the concept of unconditional love.
