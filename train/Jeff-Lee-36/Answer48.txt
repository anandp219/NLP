Fully  five people in ten are gay  and it is how God made them. Do not let misinformed and bigoted religious fundamentalists twist the meaning of love nor change what you already know  that your son deserves happiness in whatever form it takes  and equal protection under the law. Let him know that you would lay down your life for his right to be happy.
