  With apology to Jimmy Wales  Wikipedia may not be your best source  depending on whether you want what is most popular about a person  today  or what earlier historians and experts consider to be a person's most significant contributions  thoughts  and experiences. Admittedly  sometimes  Wikipedia will be superior  but my money is on the writers and editors of the several encyclopedias.If you don't want to go to the library reference section to enjoy the feel and smell of the 25 volume World Book Encyclopedia  Encyclopaedia Britannica  Funk & Wagnells Encylopedia  or Colliers Encyclopedia  electronic options arevavailable.
