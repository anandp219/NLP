  Is there a bad way to invest a billion dollars? Seriously! If it was only one million  and you were young  the various options (and various risks) would make a big difference  depending on whether you were going to try and retire early and live off the earnings  after taxes. If young  you might layer it into municipal bonds of term lengths in multiples of ten years  spending $35 000 per year initially  and then increasing it 2%-3% per year up to $65 000 per year in old age. If over 60  perhaps put in stock market and withdraw $50 000 per year for life.But if one billion dollars  even if you are very young  you could withdraw $25 million per year  and continue to take 2.5% every year for as long as you live and still not have spent any of the principal by the time you die  leaving a similar fund for your heirs.
