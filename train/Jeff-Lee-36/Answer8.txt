  According to Covey  A person has integrity when there is no gap between intent and behaviorwhen he or she is whole  seamless  the sameinside and out. I call this congruence. And it is congruencenot compliancethat will ultimately create credibility and trust. I cannot top that definition.Accountability  whether it be the formal type  or simply the willingness to take full responsibility  it is the person being measured by the results for which they are responsible. He or she is rewarded or punished for their accountable results or behavior.Leaders typically act with integrity and therefore accept accountability.
