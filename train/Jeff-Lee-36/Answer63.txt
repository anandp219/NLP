  The prime reason I see is people comparing themselves to others. Sometimes  it is in comparing themselves to an ideal set by their parents or even themselves. The problem starts with not knowing who you truly are  having an artificial construct  or ego identity  that we get addicted to believing.If you consider life in stages of growth similar to Abraham Maslowe's hierarchy of needs  we are only dissatisfied when we are stuck on a lower level. Choosing to stay with egoic thinking is the guarantee of making no movement up the ladder.
