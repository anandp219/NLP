  There is zero proof that it did not happen and extensive proof that it did. No need to cite the logic or the thousands of sources  here. Therefore  please be aware that the question itself can be considered offensive to the hundreds of thousands of death camp survivors and liberators that are still alive. There is nothing wrong with someone in a succeeding generation to be shocked and ask whether something is true that occured in the past  but to assume it is not true and then challenge others to proove it  is childish and unbecoming of a true human being or student of history.
