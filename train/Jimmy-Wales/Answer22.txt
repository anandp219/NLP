  In Wikipedia shorthand  this is what we call BLP1E - Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons notable for only one event.In general  we avoid and take great caution in writing biographies of people who are suddenly in the news for one thing. Walter Palmer was  before this incident  not even remotely notable. It is very likely that there is not enough information about him even given his current notoriety to write a quality biography.What we usually do instead is recognize that it is the event which is notable.In this case  the event is covered pretty thoroughly here: Cecil (lion).If he goes on to do other newsworthy things  then of course we would eventually have a biography.
