  I have lived in London for several years.One thing to know about London is that it is very much a city of highly diverse neighborhoods. So there is probably no single answer here that would cover the entire city. There are very liberal and gay-friendly parts of town and there are areas which are more conservative and with a large Muslim population - but even in this case see my note below for some additional thoughts.I can only speak confidently about areas where I've lived and worked - basically central London from Shoreditch to Notting Hill.
