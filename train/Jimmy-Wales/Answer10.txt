To quote Wikipedia: "In many cases  people of the same sex holding hands while walking is considered an ordinary display of friendship without romantic connotations." (from: Etiquette in the Middle East) See also: The Basics; Why Arab Men Hold Hands from the New York Times.I am unsure how that plays out in terms of the culture of London  I just throw it out there as a point for further research. For one thing  the London Muslim population is not predominantly Arab  so the links above may not apply - I just don't know.
