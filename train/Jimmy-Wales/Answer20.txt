  I am not certain that this is actually true  as no one seems to have done an authoritative or even plausible study of the question (to my knowledge)  but anecdotally I believe that it is probably true.Based on my experiences  I think that the main reason is Jewish pride in the many accomplishments of Jewish people. But a secondary reason is anti-semitic fascination with whether or not prominent people are Jewish.Both of those combined means that people seem  on average  to care more whether someone is Jewish.
