Drinking can be a lot of fun but it's certainly not a spectator sport. Eventually it becomes painfully embarrassing. If your wife is not a habitual drinker you might want to spend more time sober when you are with her. And if having a few drinks with your buddies is really important to you  it might be better to do it when she's not around.
