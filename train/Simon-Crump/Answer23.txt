  The problem with the weather in Britain is that it is very unpredictable. Within certain parameters you can experience a warm  pleasant day or a cold  miserable one at almost any time of year. I've sunbathed in February and I've known days in August when the temperature never made it into double figures (Celsius). The warmest day I've ever had in years of hill-walking in the Lake District was in March 2012.It means that average temperature and rainfall charts are not much help when determining what kind of weather you are likely to encounter.
