  The primary and secondary sectors in developed countries tend to be highly efficient. That's what makes those countries "developed"  almost by definition.As a consequence  the basic material needs of those societies can be met at relatively little cost. It doesn't require much labour to produce all the cars you could want when most of the work is done by robots  and you don't need half the population toiling in the fields when you have modern mechanised agriculture. The priorities of such societies moves away from material goods and towards services aimed at life enhancement  be that improved healthcare  better leisure opportunities  tourism  or more trivial things like pet grooming.The focus of developed economies is therefore on performing services for each other rather than making things  and that is reflected in GDP share.
