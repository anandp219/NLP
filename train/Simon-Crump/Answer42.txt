  The whole point about democracy is that you are free to propose or oppose any ideas you like  within reason. Communist ideas do exist in western countries but they are not especially popular anymore due to the unpleasant consequences of attempts to implement them in reality.Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels began work on The Communist Manifesto in the Chetham Library in Manchester  UK and it was first published in London in 1848. Neither man was persecuted  arrested or otherwise harassed. The publication has remained freely available ever since and numerous political parties have promoted its content.The path to communism envisaged by Marx  and later developed by Lenin and Trotsky among others  requires a transitional phase of socialism in which the state owns all means of production.
