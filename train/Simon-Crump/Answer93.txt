In rural areas  you'd be hard pressed to find any Muslims at all.The parliamentary discussion is a waste of time  and serves only to illustrate the folly of triggering an automatic debate if a petition raises a pre-determined number of signatures. A lot of people will sign just about any petition if someone asks them to  so all you need is a co-ordinated campaign and you can force a pointless debate in the House of Commons when it should be discussing something more important.
