The problem is it seems to take a long time to prepare and so other days I just make a sandwich  roast beef and horseradish is first choice. But if I have nothing in the fridge I will go to the bakery over the road from my office instead where they make sandwiches to order. There's a fabulous chicken tikka and mint mayo sandwich they do there which I take on a large wholemeal roll  but tomorrow I have my eye on the lamb kofta. The evening meal is the main event. I'd have curry every day if my wife let me and I make a lamb and cauliflower rogan josh which stews all day in the oven.
