There is a massive element of violence and coercion that cannot be disregarded.Notwithstanding that rather important issue  the market value of a slave is highly dependent on some fairly volatile variables. Supply is determined by how many slaves you can capture and subjugate  while demand is determined by the willingness of employers to purchase slave labour. Even if slavery were to be legal  that does not make it morally acceptable. Slave owners are likely to attract intense criticism  potentially reducing demand significantly.Alternatively you could calculate the nominal "fair" value of slave labour by considering the cost of paying someone minimum wage for a few years to perform the same work and subtracting their living expenses (risk of illness  death  mutiny or escape would mean you wouldn't account for more than a few years).
