I have no idea how Channel 4 manage to arrange insurance for the show because the activities are genuinely dangerous; for instance  the previously untrained celebrities are taught to slide down an Olympic track on a skeleton bob. It sounds like the sort of thing Steve O would be brilliant at.But he actually wasn't as good as I expected him to be. He was eliminated about half way through the run  having been beaten at aerials and ski-jumping by a mixed-gender selection of soap stars and socialites.
