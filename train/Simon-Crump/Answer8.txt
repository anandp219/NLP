  That is indeed an odd  and disturbing  question. "Fair" is an entirely subjective judgement and the concept of fairness in relation to prices is ambiguous. One definition of a "fair" price is that it accurately reflects supply and demand in a free market  another is that all the people who want or need the product can afford it  another still is that it rewards labour at a sustainable level. It's difficult to make any of those judgements with regard to slavery. The whole point about selling a slave is that it does not represent a free and fair transaction conducted to benefit all parties.
