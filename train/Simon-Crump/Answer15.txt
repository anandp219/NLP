We all knew kids at school who gave us a hard time and who we probably fantasized about exacting some revenge on  and there's always a few who will make that into a reality with whatever means they have at their disposal. Teenage boys do a lot of dumb stuff. If they live in an environment where they can acquire lethal force without raising any eyebrows  bad things will happen from time to time and you won't know where it's going to happen or when.As for the solution  that's a bit more difficult to identify.
