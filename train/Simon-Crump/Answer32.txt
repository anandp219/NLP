  You've got three main options and which is best depends on how much luggage you have  budget  time constraints  etc.. You'll probably want to go by train or rent a car.Car. Innsbruck to Venice is a fantastic drive. You head over the Brenner Pass and then you are in the Dolomites  a uniquely beautiful and spectacular mountainous region. You also pass Lake Garda so if you have time to stop along the way and enjoy the scenery  driving is the way for you. It's about four hours driving time via Verona but you'll want to take longer.Train.
