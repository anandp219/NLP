School shootings are the domain of the disgruntled misfit  loner and attention-seeker.Second  most criminals in places like Britain don't have guns either. The penalties for possession of a firearm are so high that it's not worth having one on you (or even in your house) because it's a permanent piece of evidence the police can find and use to lock you up. Criminals who need a gun for a specific job  like a hit or just to intimidate a rival  will deposit the gun with a patsy and only carry it themselves for the shortest possible time.
