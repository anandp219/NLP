Despite historical claims to be a libertarian party  UKIP's manifesto is essentially ultra-conservative in nature. Their opposition to the EU is based not on concerns about capital but the opposite; imposition of social frameworks and unrestrained movement of people. So even though Corbyn and UKIP might both want to leave the EU  they do so for different reasons. Corbyn has no common ground with the xenophobic  Daily Mail-reading contingent of UKIP's support at all.It would also be a grave mistake to assume that "working class" voters are inclined to support left-wing politicians and that therefore Corbyn has their support sewn up.
