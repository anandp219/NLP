That is the main bone of contention because everyone hates ISIS and no-one outside Turkey pays much attention to the Kurds.So from a Western perspective the Russians are attacking the wrong people because they are targeting the FSA more than ISIS  and because their weapons are perhaps not quite as technically advanced as the Americans there is also more in the way of collateral damage. Russia seems to be aiming for a resolution in which Assad remains in charge but large parts of Syria are reduced to rubble and most of the population have left.
