There is some crossover with the xenophobes but their focus is more on EU regulations imposed on the UK by Brussels (seat of the European Parliament). They lap up hyperbolic articles in the Daily Mail which propagate euromyths such as the ban on bent bananas:Guide to the best euromythsLittle Englanders don't want the EU to have any jurisdiction over internal affairs in the UK. They don't want EU working directives  they don't want the European Court of Human Rights (which is separate institution to the EU in any case) and they don't want big  bad Brussels telling us what to do and spending all our money.The socialists have a completely different problem with the EU.
