  Diana didn't play by the rules and  worse still  she wasn't prepared to carry on "taking one for the team".Being a royal in the modern era isn't a case of lying on a bear-skin chaise longue while eunuchs stand by your side peeling grapes and dropping them into your mouth. It's a tough gig which requires a great deal of personal sacrifice and  while Diana wasn't entirely oblivious to this  she was a naive young woman who didn't fully realise what she was signing up for. You toe the party line  you don't make a fool of yourself or the monarchy and if you're not happy you just have to suck it up and find a discreet outlet  preferably one such as going fishing in the Scottish Highlands.Diana either wasn't able or willing to play along.
