  The problem is glaringly obvious to everybody else; guns are far too easy to obtain in the US and that makes these kind of attacks inevitable. The fact that so many Americans are in denial of this is a source of incredulity in Britain and  I suspect  elsewhere in Europe too.Allowing ordinary civilians to arm themselves with lethal weaponry causes a lot more problems than it can ever solve. It hasn't stopped the federal government from becoming all-powerful as the founding fathers believed it would and it doesn't help the good guys defend themselves from the bad guys  because real life is not so simple as "good guys" and "bad guys".The argument goes that the criminals and terrorists will always be able to get hold of guns anyway  so it's better that law-abiding citizens can have them too to restore the balance of power between good and evil.
