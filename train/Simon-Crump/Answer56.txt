  They are both populist ideologies which appeal to people's innate desire to blame all their problems and failures on someone else; be it other races and nations (fascism) or other social classes (communism).Historically  both ideologies have been exploited by ruthless dictators to establish authoritarian states with no respect for the individual. Both have resulted in appalling genocides and human rights violations; the Nazi Holocaust (fascism)  Stalin's purges  the Chinese "Great Leap Forward"  the Cambodian Killing Fields  the Ethiopian Red Terror and the North Korean re-education camps (all communism).Neither have ever resulted in improved conditions for the ordinary people who supported their revolutions (or  in a few cases  election).
