A common theme though is that transfer payments should be seen by their recipients as a temporary crutch rather than a permanent lifestyle choice; a safety net not a hammock. Some see tax credits as a useful way of encouraging people to leave a benefits-only environment and accept low-paid work.The danger is that tax credits for the working poor simply encourages employers to put a lower value on unskilled labour because it is effectively subsidised by the state. This doesn't provide the clearly defined route out of benefits dependency that many Tories are looking for.
