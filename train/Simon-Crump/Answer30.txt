  In this context you can essentially replace the phrase "middle-class" with the word "bourgeois".The dividing line between the British working class and the lower middle classes was thoroughly obscured during the late twentieth century  particularly during the Thatcher era when many people who identified as working class were able to buy their own home for the first time and became de facto middle-class. As part of that process "middle class" became a pejorative used to describe a certain breed of professionals and business-owners who enjoy higher-than-average incomes and the privilege associated with that.
