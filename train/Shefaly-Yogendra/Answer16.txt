She got into a loud argument with me about the NHS and the state of a civilised nation having to support people who "put nothing back". Clearly she thinks she will always be able-bodied and young  and never in need of support. You could say I am contradicting my own answer by telling you about a long married couple with polar opposite politics. But I really am not. It is a disharmonious relationship which is sustaining because they cannot afford to go their own ways. Hardly a union worth having!
