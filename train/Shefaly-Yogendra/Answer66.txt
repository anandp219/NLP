  The answer depends on what you expect 74yo persons to look like. Mr B wears a wig which is made of dark hair. This is a common ruse to look young  and if the rest of the package holds up  nobody questions the hair. He is tall and has always been lean  partly genetics partly his professional need. Being in good physical shape can make people seem younger. He has also had to be actively working and earning since ABCL went up in smoke and his career in politics proved to be a damp squib.He is also not known for damaging habits such as smoking or drinking though he often portrayed drunk  violent young men.
