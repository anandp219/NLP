  I don't believe there is  in a corporate customer service context  any completely unscripted interaction. There is at best a scripted-unscripted-scripted sandwich  and I would posit  there too is a degree of scripting in the middle layer especially when CSAs are trained. An unscripted conversation may work well when the customer is looking for a customised solution such as advice on a personalised gift for someone  or travel planning. The CSA needs skills to be able to define and fine-tune the customer's actual need  often advise on budgeting and then help formulate a budget  understand preferences and boundary conditions  and then confirm it all.
