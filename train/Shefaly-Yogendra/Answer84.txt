  Large cruise ships leave for New York from Southampton all the time  but it is not possible to take those cruise ships from London. The river Thames is an active  working river and people live alongside it  but not commercially active to the extent it was when Turner etc were making romantic paintings of it. Also its location is to the eastern edge of the British Isles whereas New York lies to the west  which makes Southampton a better choice for big ships. Paris doesn't have a port so to travel by boat from there to anywhere will be an expensive  roundabout trip  so "not really" is the answer to your question.
