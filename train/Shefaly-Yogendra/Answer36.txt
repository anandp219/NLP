Understanding the riskYou need to understand fully short and long term risks of such surgeryIf you are in doubt  your surgeon should be able to explain and clarify various probabilities and what the risk profile of your specific case may beYou may need to be comfortable discussing the minuscule but finite risk of death in such surgeries (sorry! )Understanding your responsibilities for the outcome & your commitmentSuccess in losing and keeping weight off will require you to make and stick to the dramatic changes in food intake that the surgery will necessitateYou may need to identify and establish your support systems (which may be friends  family  therapists  or other supporting people) and discuss how you will ensure they help you keep your weight loss and recovery on plan (plenty of people will not understand the drastic changes you will need to make and you may love them but they are not going to help you post-surgery and may risk your health without understanding the challenges).
