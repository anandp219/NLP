As an example  please take a look at the "Why  Women?" blog that logs the odd questions that can only come from a place of believing women are an alien species. The issue of public safety and addressing systemic axiological issues aren't the only problems the community faces. People ask questions about suicide here (the questions get tagged with helpline info). A large number of users ask about where they can download or stream - for free of course - creative content such as books or films  and those questions are allowed to stand too (I raise this issue often enough because answering such questions is aiding and abetting).
