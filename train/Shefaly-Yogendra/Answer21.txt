  Late edit -- the question detail "I should add that mathematics is my big passion and that I therefore fond the mathematics course at Cambridge very interesting." was added after the answer below was written. The answer still holds for the main question which is otherwise too reliant on question details  which is not in line with Quora policy. Answer: Really  no one can give you a firm or reliable answer to this question. It is hugely subjective. But I will try. In your question and details  you omit to mention the degree or course you may be applying to  while you have told us several notable biographical achievements.
