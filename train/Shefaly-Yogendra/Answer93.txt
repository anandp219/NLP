  In an older answer I have written something that may address part of your question. Shefaly Yogendra's answer to Why do people not care about anything unless it involves them?The longer explanation I am afraid lies in trying to figure out why Indian society looks down upon the weak  the poor  the elderly. We are dominantly a hugely hierarchy driven society -- think caste  as an example. Combine that thinking with the human disposition to classify things quickly  often in a reductive manner  so as to derive some sort of heuristic to deal with the person we are dealing with.
