  Quora with its relatively small and homogeneous team  a strategic focus on product over people  and its preference for machine learning as the moderation method of choice (development aided by a small team of human volunteers who are trusted reporters; it is a small number and a smidgen more diverse than the management team)  is trying to strike a tricky balance between becoming the go-to knowledge community and being a safe place for its users  who create the content to answer such curiosities  as you describe  which come in thick and fast  repeatedly  often asked anonymously.
