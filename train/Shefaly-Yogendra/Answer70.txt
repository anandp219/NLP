If you can build a positive and optimistic attitude  and your body is fit  you will look back in a few years on this question and wonder why you wanted to cram everything into one year. In other words  a purposive life makes checklist living unnecessary. Lay the foundation for enjoying more than half of your life that lies ahead  unexplored! All the best.
