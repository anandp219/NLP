Other India related writers I enjoy are Bala Senthil Kumar  Ishita Roy  Indira Sen  Archie D'Cruz - ok I will edit this a few times to add more names here. So come back and check later! On development and aid issues  read Nathan Ketsdever and Makarand Sahasrabuddhe. On U.S. immigration related advice including in startup context  Dana H. Shultz.Angel investing is best addressed in answers by David S. Rose. I have had some fun answering pop culture questions asked by and related answers (did you know he has seen Taylor Swift live?)
