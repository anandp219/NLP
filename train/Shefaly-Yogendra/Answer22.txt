If I were a person reading your application  I would chalk that missing detail down to "an inability to identity crucial issues  which may need addressing". If you are applying for a graduate degree  that inability is going to be a significant problem. Cambridge graduate degrees require  indeed presume  students to have a high degree of meta-intelligence and self motivation in studying as much or as little as they wish to. If you are applying for an undergraduate degree  be aware that unlike American universities  Cambridge makes very little room for exploring what you may want to study at the undergraduate level and you will have to choose upfront what you wish to study.
