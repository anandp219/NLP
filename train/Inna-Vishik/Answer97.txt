  The human voice box (see: Larynx) is a resonant cavity of sorts  which amplifies sounds seeded by vibration of the vocal chords. An analogy of this is a guitar  where plucking the strings produces the initial sound  but this sound is amplified by bouncing around in the body. Helium has a higher speed of sound than air so it tends to amplify higher frequency sounds.The simplest way to think of the voice box (or any resonant cavity) is that sounds will be amplified if you can fit an integer number of wavelengths in the cavity.
