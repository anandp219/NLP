This coupled with the fact that it is 100x more expensive and used in orders of magnitude less quantity than helium-4  might make lunar mining a less ridiculous proposition. However  the earth's resources of He-3 have not been utilized to their full capacity  so I foresee an effort in that area before lunar mining is considered.see: Page on fas.org
