  There are a couple of points in this questions and in the existing answers which need to be addressedCapacitive touchscreensTouchscreens operate like a bunch of parallel plate capacitors  where the capacitance C is given by [math]\epsilon A/d[/math]  where [math]\epsilon[/math] is the permitivity of the dielectric material (how electrically polarizeable it is) between the two conducting plates (which are Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) films in the case of most smartphones)  A is the surface area of the capacitive element  and d is the distance between the plates.
