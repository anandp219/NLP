**If winning a Nobel prize is really your goal  then condensed matter physics is a great field to be in  because there are an infinite number of potential research questions with new ones being invented all the time. ***Another such system is VO2  which features an insulator-metal transition near room temperature which people have struggled to explain. Ed Caruthers studied this in his PhD decades ago  and people are still making discoveries worthy of high-impact publications to this day.
