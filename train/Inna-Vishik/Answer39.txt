  The Fermi surface is the locus of zero-energy excitations in a metal. Superconductivity is a low energy electronic phenomenon  defined (in part) by a superconducting gap which is centered on the Fermi surface. The Fermi surface is determined by the number of charge carriers and the type of bonding the material undergoes  and it can be measured experimentally by a number of experimental techniques (see: Inna Vishik's answer to What kind of qualitative and quantitative information can be obtained from ARPES?
