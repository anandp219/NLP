I admit this is corny  but so are those races where people are expected to dress in a costume  so women's races are hardly the only culprits. Some people argue that in this day and age  where women already participate heavily in road races and only compete against other women for placement and prizes  all-women's races are a bit superfluous. Perhaps  but many of these races (not NWM) are organized by women-focused athletics brands (which need to exist in the marketplace because women have distinct apparel needs)  so it seems more like a natural branding exercise to me.
