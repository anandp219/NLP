One factor which is favorable for BCS superconductivity is atoms which can vibrate very fast  which tends to be lighter elements. The lightest atom is hydrogen  but the problem is that it does not have high density of electron states at the Fermi level because it is not a metal. This can be mitigated by pressurizing the crap out of it. Metallic H under high pressure is expected to become superconducting at approximately room temperature (300-350K) [2][3]  so this is the theoretical upper limit for BCS theory.
