It is during this process that it can scatter with other electrons and impart some of its energy. The electron escapes from the surface of the sample and loses energy corresponding to the material's work functionThe possibility of producing another photoelectron can happen either in step 1 or step 2:Step 1: if the photon has high enough energy  it can excite an electron from deep below the Fermi level ('core states')  leaving behind a hole. If the hole is filled by a lower energy electron (close to the Fermi level)  this process will produce another photon which can photoemit another electron.
