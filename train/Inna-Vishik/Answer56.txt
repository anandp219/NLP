  Among some sectors of the experimental physics community  scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is perceived as being more capital intensive than other small-lab-based experimental techniques. This characterization isn't necessarily accurate  because most small-lab-based physics experiments are 'expensive'* these days since most experiments are quite specialized and don't enjoy any economies of scale.The main factor potentially driving up the cost of STM is vibration isolation. If you want to study atoms on sub-atomic length scales and maintain position registry 1000 atoms away  you need to make sure that the STM tip does not vibrate relative to the sample too much.
