  As Jess H. Brewer correctly pointed out  researchers primarily use liquid helium to cool down high temperature superconductors  though applications of these materials strive to operate with much cheaper liquid nitrogen. There are a number of reasons that researchers use liquid helium:Many high temperature superconductors (e.g. all Fe-based HTS materials and several important cuprate HTS materials) have transition temperatures below the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. Physicists have different standards than normal people as to what constitutes high temperature.Some experiments strive to measure ground state properties  and some experiments would suffer from unacceptable noise/broadening if they were conducted at liquid nitrogen temperatures.
