Here  the relevant energy is the work function of the metal  which varies a bit among materials  but 4.5 eV is a good guess. This corresponds to a time uncertainty of 0.9 fs.Step 2: This step is given by [math]\frac{\text{how far the electron travels}}{\text{how fast it is going}}[/math]. Lets only consider primary electrons  which make it outside the sample without scattering with other electrons first. Thus  'how far the electron travels' is given by the electron's mean free path in the material.
