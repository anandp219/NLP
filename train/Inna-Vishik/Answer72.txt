The easiest way to think about Johnson noise is by adopting a classical picture of electrons in a solid (which I will do below)  though it can be described quantum mechanically as well.Every resistor (and all real metals show some resistance) has noise at finite temperature which is proportional to the resistance (which itself is a function of temperature) and the temperature--this is Johnson-Nyquist noise. In a classical picture  this arises from an increased number of collisions when ions are moving around more energetically (increased temperature) or when there are more impurities introduced into the metal (higher resistance at the same temperature).
