The coverletter is usually 1-2 pages long. An example structure is as follows:Introductory paragraph/sentence: "With this note  we would like to submit our manuscript  titled ________ (maybe include # of words and # of figures in parenthesis)  for consideration as a Letter/Article/ResearchReport. "Second paragraph: summarize key findings to an audience (the editor) who might not be a specialist in your field.
