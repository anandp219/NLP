The first 1/4 of the book is filled with history and mathematical formalism  which is unacceptable for a physics textbook. Some people have this erroenous idea that one needs to learn all the mathematics they need before they tackle physics concepts. If someone has chosen to be a physics major  they will almost certainly be more engaged if you introduce mathematical concepts as necessary to explain physics concepts. This book could have started with just one introductory math chapter  like many other quantum mechanics books.Concepts are presented in a weird order which doesn't properly reflect a natural pedagogical progression.
