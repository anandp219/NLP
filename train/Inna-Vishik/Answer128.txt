I feel this is not a good use of people's time  and feedback on their content would almost certainly be more helpful. I understand that there are other languages which are much more rigid than English  in which people tend to judge others' intelligence based on their spoken execution of the language. However  English is a more flexible language and it also has a lot more non-native speakers than most other languages. Thus  in my opinion  people come off pedantic when they frequently correct spoken English grammar without solicitation in the context of academia where the speaker is known to be highly educated.
