While this is not a high Tc by any stretch  this work brought this approach to a wider audience. More recently  researchers have found that a single unit cell of FeSe grown on STO has a Tc which far exceeds the Tc of FeSe as a bulk crystal (see: High-temperature superconductivity at the FeSe/SrTiO${}_{3}$ interface...I think this is the first report  but not 100% sure). The origin of this high Tc is still a topic of research and has been connected to charge transfer at the interface  interfacial strain  and interfacial electron-phonon coupling.
