This 100L of liquid helium weighs only ~12.5kg. An equal volume of water would weigh almost 10 times as much. According to wikipedia  previous space shuttle launches had payloads of ~15 000kg (and this didn't go as far as the moon  but whatever). This is only $1.2 million of helium at today's prices  and launching a shuttle to reach the moon (which is a lot cheaper than say  jupiter) is at least two orders of magnitude more expensive  not to mention the cost of actually finding and mining helium on the moon.
