First of all  most scientists are not driven by dreams of winning a Nobel prize. When they start working on a difficult problem  they have no idea if their solution will work  and if they do find a solution  there is often no way to know if their insight is important  because that is predicated on how it influences the field in the future. That is to say  if you write 'winning a Nobel prize'** as a goal on your statement of purpose for graduate school admissions  the committee will assume you are a lunatic and toss your application in the trash.
