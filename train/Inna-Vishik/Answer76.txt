  When I was an undergraduate in physics many of the exams were HARD (but usually open book  open notes)  such that the average grade was well below 75%. No doubt there were some exams which were doable by a majority of the class  but these do not stick out in my mind. This approach has both good and bad points.Good:Real physics problems are challenging  and finding a solution within three hours of seeing the problem is an unnatural occurrenceBecause of the blessings bestowed upon us by the god of partial credit  we were encouraged to try very challenging problems which is helpful for future coursesIt is difficult for professors to come up with exams of the appropriate length and difficulty to be doable in 3 hours but sufficiently challenging to differentiate people who mastered the material better than others  and also not repeat textbook problems or problems from previous year's exams.
