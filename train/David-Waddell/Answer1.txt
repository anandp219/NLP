  You need to accept that regrets are both natural and healthy. Your past is unchangeable and it's ok to feel regretful. Most of us have regrets  unless we're entirely bereft of self-awareness.But - given the details you've outlined - you also need to take a greater share of responsibility for accepting a relationship you were ambivalent about. The idea that your boyfriend took advantage of you is pejorative way of expressing the details of what actually happened. It's also worth considering to what extent did you take advantage of your boyfriend and his emotions  leading him to believe he was developing a real relationship  when for you it was really an experiment.
