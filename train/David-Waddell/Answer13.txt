I wonder whether such a sea-change would have been felt also in the rest of the UK? Alternatively  if NI was cast adrift from the UK against the wishes of her people  what would that say about the UK's commitment to its remaining territories  including Scotland  the disputed Falkland Islands and Gibraltar? That may have an impact on the psyche of population of the rump-UK.
