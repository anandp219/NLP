But there is a grey area  and it's not uncommon for a paper of the left to show pictures of David Cameron or George Osborne apparently snarling or laughing at the plight of the poor  or for a paper of the right to show an equally unflattering picture of a Labour leader to illustrate other serious political news stories.While I think it can be unduly unfair or deceptive to show especially unflattering pictures of politicians  I think most readers are likely to see through it. It says more about the publication than about the leader in question.In my working role for the BBC I select video material for news output.
