I also allowed them for a long time to be the ones to lead in what they used - in the last 6 months  I've become more active in specifying that I prefer "mom"  "she" and "her".I am looking forward to the day when they have children of their own  if any of them decide to do so  and I am around to see it. It will be the first time when I will have any family members with no pre-transition knowledge of me  and I hope that it can give us a more normal  and unchallenged  relationship.
