  A person is the gender that they say that they are - there are no mandatory signs that must be present in advance to make your gender identity "valid".I was married to a woman for nearly 25 years and we had 4 biological children together. I spent 12 years in the Canadian army as an armoured officer. While I occasionally cross dressed  it was always with borrowed clothes. And while I occasionally did subtly gender variant things  they only became visible as gender variant after I came out.I know trans women that never cross dressed.
