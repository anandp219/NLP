  No. The question assumes that gender differences require gender limitations. I don't believe that this is true.As other answers have pointed out  upwards of 90% and likely greater than 99% of humans are cisgender. This means that the probability is likely less than 1% that your child will be discontent with the gender assigned to them at birth. And the reality is that your social experiment will needlessly make your child an object of uncertainty and oddity  something that our monkey genes encourage us to ostracize and ridicule.
