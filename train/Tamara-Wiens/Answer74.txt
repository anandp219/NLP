It can be difficult for someone to know how to relate to a trans person when they are a friend  or even a stranger  but when that person is as central to your life as a parent  that presents multiple additional challenges.It has also created issues with how they refer to me - they have a long history of "dad"  "he" and "his"  and getting to a point where they recognize and accept that those are neither the appropriate terms  nor desirable and respectful  is hard. For the most part  my girls don't refer to me in the third person or by name/title when I am around  bypassing the issue  but I do know that my ex continues to use the pre-transition terms and pronouns  which makes it particularly difficult for me to move to a more acceptable/congruent convention.
