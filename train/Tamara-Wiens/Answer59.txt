Trying to make it something about sexual orientation just confuses you  and everyone else.Second  sexual orientation and gender identity are fundamentally different things - orientation is about WHO you want to go to bed WITH  while identity is about WHAT you want to go to bed AS. This difference gets lost in the minds of many cis people  including the gay community  because the inclusion of the T in LGBT makes many people think that trans people are just an odd kind of gay. The reality is that a trans person can be L (or G)  B  or hetero  AS WELL AS being trans - and when you add in asexual and pansexual  you get all of the orientations to which a trans person can belong.Third  transition for a trans person isn't the adoption of a gender - it's the external/visible/public acknowledgement of an inborn gender identity which is at odds with the gender assigned at birth.
