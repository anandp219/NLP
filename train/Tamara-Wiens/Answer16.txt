  You're in a difficult time  and dealing with a difficult situation. At 15  your body is in the midst of becoming adult  differentiating itself from the relatively androgynous body that you had up to the time that you hit puberty. The hormones that are running through you right now are pretty much guaranteed to mess up your emotions  and play with your thoughts and self-concepts. You are also dealing with a dysphoria  a sense of incorrectness about your situation  and it's an area in which seeking adult help  or even admitting that you have these questions  is likely to cause you as many as  or more problems than  you are dealing with at this moment.You are actually expressing a few different challenges in your details - let's break them down.You feel like a boy  although you were identified as a girl at birth.You are uncomfortable with "female norm" activities and clothing  and prefer activities and clothing which are normally seen as "male".You feel romantic (and possibly sexual) attraction toward girls.Given your question summary  I would guess that you are somewhere on the transgender spectrum  experiencing gender dysphoria - but the rest of your details make me uncertain.
