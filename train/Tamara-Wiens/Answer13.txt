  Thank you for the A2A.In general  I have no issues with LotR as a book - I have read it numerous times and loved each reading. However  if I must pick something  I will. First  I found some of the poetry and song passages excessively long. While I understand that they form an important part of the mythology of Middle Earth  they can be somewhat tedious. Second would be the stylistic inconsistencies. As other answerers have noted  the style becomes more flowery as the book progresses  but there are departures even from that progression - IIRC  the conversation between Shagrat and Gorbag is one such difference.
