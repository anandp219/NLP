If you have taken the time to arouse her  and take care of her pleasure first (even bringing her to orgasm  although you shouldn't expect to achieve this the first time  even if she is already orgasmic (NB there are estimates that at least 50% of women are pre or non orgasmic  so there are a LOT of women that simply won't orgasm  no matter what sounds they make))  then she will be very  very forgiving of any little mistakes that you make. But remember  there is a lot of sensitive tissue down there that can be easily chafed and abraded if your partner isn't sufficiently well lubricated (same for you  actually).
