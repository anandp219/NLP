  None. Doctor's will not prescribe anti-androgens or HRT for gender dysphoria alleviation until there is a recognition by the trans woman that she needs to transition  and there is a suitable diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Even self-medication won't happen until the individual has a strong enough realization of their gender mismatch that they feel driven to seek out any medical recourse  even the dangerous ones  to resolve the issue.Can you clarify why exactly these trans women started taking medication if they hadn't already self-identified as having gender dysphoria?
