But within 2 months or so  I realized that it was so much worse than that  that it wasn't just about the clothes or "playing at" being a woman  I was a woman  had been one for all my life  and needed to be publicly seen as the woman that I knew that I was. I count Feb 3  2012 as my "coming out to me" day  but by other measures  it could be as early as 1982 (or earlier  because there is other stuff that I was doing without being conscious of it)  or as late as early April 2012.
