They had some awareness of what being transgender meant  from TV and popular media  but this is prior to the rise of Orange is the New Black  Parenthood and Caitlyn Jenner's coming out. Although I am certain that they understood what I mean about being trans  I am also certain that they had no idea how much that revelation would impact me  and them.It has been difficult to maintain relationships with two of my daughters  partly because of things that happened  and largely that I did  before transitioning  but also because of the transition itself.
