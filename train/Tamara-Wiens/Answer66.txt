The second was at the 16 year point. I reached the conclusion that our relationship was fundamentally broken  that it wasn't going to change and that there was nothing to be done. I gave up and we actually separated for about 6 months  but we reconciled and carried on.The last was at the 24 year mark. I came out to my ex  and she decided that our marriage wasn't going to work with such a drastic change in me. Although I fought it for a long time  I recognize the wisdom of her decision  and appreciate that we went through with the divorce at that time.Of course  no 2 relationships are the same so YMMV.
