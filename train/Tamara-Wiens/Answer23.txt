  What gay thoughts? Are you finding people of your gender sexually attractive? Do you imagine going on a romantic date with someone of your gender? When you see someone of your gender  do you imagine what they would look like without clothes?If you answer "yes"  then maybe you are "getting those gay thoughts" because you are  in fact  gay. On the other hand  maybe you are just thinking in non-linear ways. Only you can tell. The GOOD thing about this is that  if you ARE gay  this is about as good a time to come out as there ever has been in the English speaking world.
