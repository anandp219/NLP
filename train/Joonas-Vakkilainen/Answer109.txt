When my teacher demonstrated some German verb form  a student exclaimed that "why everything needs to be conjugated?! "  as if conjugating languages were more difficult than word order based languages. (I'm learning Chinese  too  so I can tell it doesn't mean that.) Even Swedish is seen more difficult than English even though it is grammatically simpler than English or German in many aspects. This prevents people from looking into other languages (though  I must say that my country has a lot of language-skilled people in other languages  too).
