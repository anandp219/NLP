English has its unvoiced stops aspirated  which ensures that they are not blended with the voiced stops. Because of that  the voicing difference between the English voiced and voiceless stops is bigger than in Japanese. Because the Japanese voiceless stops don't have aspiration (sometimes they have little of it)  an English-speaker may mix them with the voiced stops.
