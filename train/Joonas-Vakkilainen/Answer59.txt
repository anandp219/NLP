Ammuin karhut means 'I shot the bears'  saying that the bears are dead now. Including the word 'rarely' here makes it really weird: ammuin karhut harvoin  meaning 'I rarely shot all the bears' and thus killed them  would work in a context  where there is always a certain group of bears  which the speaker occasionally kills as a whole group.Plural partitive objects is the only possibility in the perfect tense: olen ampunut karhuja harvoin  meaning 'I have shot bears rarely'. Using the total object here does not work.
