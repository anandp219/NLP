Similarly  spoken language has different styles and registers that are used in different situations: your speech is clearly different in a job interview than it is in your bedroom. Science has its own specific definitions of words but in the everyday language those same words can be used with different meanings (for example irony does not mean the same in literature as it means in casual English). Nobody is expected to speak in a scientific or formal style on his/her living room couch. The norms of the standard (written) language are not supposed to be the standards of the spoken everyday language.
