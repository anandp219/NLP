However  this article starts with a very good paragraph about the language change  and the rest of the text should be read keeping that in mind.The question being about European languages  let's look at Finnish  Icelandic  Lithuanian and Irish Gaelic.Finnish is a conservative language within the Uralic family. It has plenty of words that have not change much after Proto-Uralic. For example  the Proto-Uralic word *pojka ('son') is poika in Finnish but fi in Hungarian  which is another Uralic language.
