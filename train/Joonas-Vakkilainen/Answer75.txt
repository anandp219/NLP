Traditional dialectology concentrates on static language. Dialects are seen as stable form of language that can be described with the terms of grammar and lexicon. For instance  Finnish dialectologists (Finnish dialects belong to the most researched dialects in the world  by the way) in the 20th century did their fieldwork by interviewing old people who had lived their all life in the same village without getting a good education. The interviewees were supposed to live specifically in rural areas.
