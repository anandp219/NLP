  It is important to note that budo arts are not primarily self defense  and that self defense is not the same as martial arts. Budo is a modernised way to practice combat techniques safely  without a combat  in a world where we don't constantly have to spend time in a battlefield. The old bujutsu () meant the combat methods to harm permanently or to kill an opponent as fast as possible. Bujutsu was developed into bud ()  where the aim was not to train warriors but enhance people both physically and mentally.
