  If the question means what is grammatical English  the answer is the English that is produced by its native speakers according to their inherent  subconscious rules. There is of course variation: what sounds perfectly grammatical and thus correct in the ears of a New Zealander  might sound incorrect in the ears of a Scot. None of those forms of English is more correct than any other. They have all developed during the natural process of language.Language also includes different registers. This means that language produced by the same speaker is different in different situations.
