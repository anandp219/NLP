Many Japanese aikido senseis don't even teach technique almost at all  they just teach aiki  "meeting with the ki" (you are free to see that spiritually or physically (I do the latter one)). In aikido  the practitioners are not in a combat with each other; they are helping each other to observe those aiki things. Both the attacker and the target of the attack have their own important roles in that process. On the other hand  the effectiveness of self defense is more about the way how it is realised than about the art itself.
