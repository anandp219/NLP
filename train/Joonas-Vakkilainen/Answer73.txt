Sami is a Uralic subgroup as well. I have no idea why it is connected to North Africa in the question details [EDIT: concerning the original details]. Sami people are the only indigenous nation in the European Union  and today most of them are Christians. They are living in the area of northern parts of Norway  Sweden and Finland as well as Kola Peninsula in Russia.
