The long quantity requires a trill but usually two rolls are enough  and some pronounce even the long r as without any trilling. On the contrary  in Spanish you must be able to differentiate between the flap and the trill (pero vs. perro). Furthermore  [r] really is a difficult sound to articulate. Many native speakers of rolled r languages have troubles in it at least in childhood. As a little kid  I replaced [r] with some kind of lateral fricative (I had a so called cheek r). Both of my brothers never learnt it.
