Though  the Finnish equivalents herra and rouva are used  too.Madam is translated matami  which is quite a weird word. I don't think it is actually a honorific in contemporary Finnish  and the only place I believe it can be heard is some old films. I suppose it is a good word to be used in fairy tales and comic books. Sir is not translated (or then it is translated by using the actual title of the addressee). When Dobby talks to Harry  every sir has just been left out from the translation. The story is supposed to happen in the UK so it wouldn't be good to remove every cultural feature in the speech of the characters.
