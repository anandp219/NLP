  The question has a false premise. Finland does allow refugees to come. A lot of room (closed schools and hospitals for example) are used to accommodate thousands of refugees. Many volunteers are helping them: for instance  there are not enough Finnish language teachers for the refugees so many volunteers are tutoring them. There are demonstrations demanding the closing of the borders  there are unfortunately racist statements  but there are also demonstrations demanding help for refugees and welcoming them in.
