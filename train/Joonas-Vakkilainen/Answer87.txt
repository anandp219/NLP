  In the Microsoft/Nokia product  it is the plural partitive of the Finnish word lumi  which means 'snow'. The plural partitive has the meaning of 'snows'  where the amount of snow is indefinite. However  snow is an uncountable word so the plural doesn't make sense in most contexts. If we consider of the usage of this form in Finnish  we could look at a yard with several piles of snow  and say for example that lumia ei ole viel viety pois meaning literally that 'snows have not yet been taken away'.
