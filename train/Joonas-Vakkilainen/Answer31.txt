  Louie Popp gave a detailed answer about those languages but the indigenous languages are missing: the Saami languages. The Saami languages spoken in the area of Scandinavia are Pite  Lule  Ume  Southern and Northern Saami. Finnish spoken in Scandinavia can be divided into three parts. Strictly speaking  Finnish refers only to the Finnish-Swedish citizens and newer Finnish immigrants. Those are called svergefinnar in Swedish. Finnic people living in the region along the Torne River speak Torne Valley Finnish  which is also called with their own name Menkieli.
