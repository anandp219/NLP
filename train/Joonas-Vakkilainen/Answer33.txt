  You don't need any physical preparation. Some judo clubs are sport- and competition-orientated  some are more technically-focused. Instructors will tell what kind of additional practice they recommend if any. For example  many judokas practice with an elastic band  but you can't do that in advance because it requires knowledge of the techniques. If you are going to practice traditional judo or judo without competition  there is no need to have certain physical fit. Techniques matter  not your strength (which unfortunately may be otherwise in modern competitive judo).As for equipment  beginners' classes usually allow you to join with normal sport clothing.
