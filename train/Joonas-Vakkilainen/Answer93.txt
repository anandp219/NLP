  Based on the question  you are a native English-speaker. English phontactics doesn't allow syllable-initial [ts]. Thus  let's look at the problem from the English point of view./ts/ is pronounced by placing the tongue on the /t/ place and then releasing the airflow with the /s/ manner. Although this specific cluster or affricate is not possible in English  English does have a similar kind of affricate in word like church and cheese. The method of the ch // sound is similar as the one of the ts sound but it happens in a different place.
