As for when we're younger? Have you tried being an Indian teen with a hobby? Our parents are extremely academically minded. If you as much as show interest in a subject matter  quite often  you're whipped back in line. Cultivating a hobby is something that requires an at least neutral environment. Ours is often a hostile one  in this regard. The rest of that paragraph is overly sarcastic bullshit  and even racist  or at least colorist. Being dark is not a shame  nor bad  nor wrong  nor in any way inferior to being light-skinned.
