Keep the 90 bend at all times.HandstandsNow we come to learning the handstand against a wall. My favorite way to do it is getting into a push-up position with my hands about half a foot from the wall  and then kicking up with my feet. Practice staying in this position for at least a minute straight  but build up to it over time. As a safety measure  practice this with a folded towel on the ground below the spot your head is  just in case your arms give out on you. It's unlikely to happen if you followed the instructions above  however.Adding the push-up back inSo you've got your body into shape.
