  It depends on a ton of factors.How old were you exactly? If you were 13 years and 8 months old  you might not be that much faster at 14 years and 1 month of age. Have you gained weight since then? Maybe that's a good thing  if it's muscle mass in the legs.If there is a roughly 12 months period in between  I think there's a good chance you actually gained .5 seconds of time  assuming nothing (your health or diet) is coming in the way. If you have been training properly since then  then you'll likely blow the 12 second mark away.
