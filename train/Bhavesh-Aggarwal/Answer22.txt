  Ah  the most feared phenomenon in exercising  even more so than injuries: the plateau. Let's take a moment to understand what a plateau is. If we consider improvements induced by exercise to be climbing up the steps towards your goal  a plateau is a phase where you're not advancing. For some reason  the adaptation and improvement you seek from the exercise  diet  and rest you're following is not coming.At such points  you must pause  and reconsider what you're doing. Maybe  it's time to take a week off of exercising  or exercising your chest in particular.
