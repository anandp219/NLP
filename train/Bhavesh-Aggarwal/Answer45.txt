  Good bodyweight exercise for the upper chest all have one thing in common. They are pushing movements with the hands 'higher* than the shoulders. Elevated Push-UpsPush-ups with elevated feet hit the upper chest hard. When I say 'elevated'  I mean elevated to somwhere between 50-70% percent of your height. It's a great way to make standard push-ups more challenging  and get that upper chest to work.Lady  tuck those elbows in! Pike Push-UpsPike push-ups are often done with the feet elevated (although the basic version is with the feet on the ground)  but there is a break at the hip  so you look like a half-opened jackknife from the side.
