I'd rather they don't sell anything than offer junk.Personally  it would be great to rent gym shoes at the gym (or hey  get to borrow them for free with my membership).The locker rooms and shower should be clean  well-lit and adequately large  just some common sense things. My reality is  that I train without being in a gym most of the time. All I need is a floor  a wall  perhaps a park bench or other elevated surface (stairs are great)  and an overhead bar. Maybe  maybe  some light dumbbells. And that's a wrap.Thanks for the A2A  Kiran Kannar.
