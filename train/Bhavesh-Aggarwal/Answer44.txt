higher speed without build-up of lactic acid. So if you're a 10k expert  you want to do longer intervals at slightly lower speeds. Again  as an example  sprint 40 seconds  rest 20. Accelerate to 80-90% of your maximum speed. Increase the difficulty by making the work interval longer (and consequently a lower percentage of your max speed). Rest until you've mostly cleared the lactic acid from your muscles. This rest interval should steadily decrease and/or the distance covered should slightly increase over time.What HIIT can't do very efficiently is give you the capacity to finish a very long race.
