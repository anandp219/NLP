The legs and core  as Aaron rightly noted  are the prime targets of training  but a sprinter without a powerful upper body can't make it to elite status. Period.Plus  size is just one variable when it comes to strength. A variety of builds can be found in sprinting  even in the 100m. In every Olympic sprints discipline (100m  200m  400m)  coaches generally divide their sprinters in two types. One that is 'moving up' and one that is 'going down' in distance  sometimes also know as speed vs endurance type or as power vs strength type respectively.
