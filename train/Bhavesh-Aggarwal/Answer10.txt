  Beards are a weird thing. Prized among many men as a symbol of masculinity  often disliked among women as a sign of poor hygiene. Did your endocrinologist ever check your testosterone? It might be low  so that could be part of the puzzle. You can naturally boost testosterone by exercising (short term) and decreasing body fat (long term). There isn't a whole lot else. Maybe  you just don't happen to have many hair follicles in your face  or they're wired in a way that makes it hard for them to grow.
