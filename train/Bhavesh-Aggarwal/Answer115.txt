Ideally  it would be a set of monkey bars  and there would also be a pair of adjustable dip bars. Rings for ring dips are are great too. A glute-ham-raise station is something of a dream for me.Finally  some good cardio machines for warming up or endurance activities in general.Generally  I'd like the gym to be spacious so people can do their work without disturbing -or worse- injuring each other. An area set aside for medicine ball throws would be great. The atmosphere should be friendly and open  but focussed on training.
