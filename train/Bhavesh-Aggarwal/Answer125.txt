  Of course  every straight/bi guy will have his own 'soft spots'  but here are those I can think of off the top of my head:1. Likes childrenI'm a fanatic for little children  and I regularly consider kidnapping babies I see in strollers and raising them as my own. Okay  maybe not  but you get the point. The opposite  not liking children  would be a deal-breaker for me.2. Is playfulPlayful teasing and joking around is my favorite way to interact with the people I care for  as many even on Quora can confirm.
