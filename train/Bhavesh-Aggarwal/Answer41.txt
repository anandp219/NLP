  Yes  absolutely.There's nothing wrong with a White author writing about Black characters. Your specific example is further made easier because your Black characters live on a continent where there are no White people  so there are fewer of those power structure issues that might plague e.g. a White American author writing about a Black American. Even then  White people writing Black characters isn't wrong or bad per se. A problem may arise if White authors are the only ones doing so  or making the character stereotypical or offensive  obviously.
