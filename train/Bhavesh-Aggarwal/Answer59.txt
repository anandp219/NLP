A truly determined person can get a workout anywhere in the world.Whether you choose to go the pure calisthenics route  or throw in some improvised or acquired forms of extra resistance  you can become functionally strong  powerful  fast  and big using very little equipment. If I were your coach  the only thing I would ask for is your heartfelt commitment to the journey. Talent and pre-existing skill are immutable  and therefore of no concern to us. But exercise should be like a good marriage. You stick with it 'till death do us part.
