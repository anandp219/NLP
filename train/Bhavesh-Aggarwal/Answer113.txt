  The three limiting factors are economy of time  geography  and money. If it's too expensive or takes too long (or too much money) to get to  it's out of the question. My ideal gym doesn't need many Nautilus style machines. I don't mind if they're there  but I don't need them. All I need are good  old-school barbells -with plates  of course- and dumbbells (ideally  the heaviest pair would be around 2x60kg)  a squat rack and a bench. Maybe some bouncy plates for power cleans  but this is heavy fantasizing on my part.
