  The muscles involved in the flexion of the lower arm are the biceps brachiibrachialisbrachioradialisThe biceps originates at the shoulder blade  and inserts at the radius. It can do arm and lower arm flexion  as well as supination (turning the palm upwards) of the lower arm.The brachialis is the strongest flexor in the elbow joint. It originates on the humerus (upper arm) and attaches to the ulna.The brachioradialis is technically a forearm muscle  but it too originates from the lower part of the humerus  and as the name says  attaches to the lower part of the radialis bone.
