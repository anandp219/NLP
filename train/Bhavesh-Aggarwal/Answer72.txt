For example  if you're practicing push-ups on that day  do 2 sets of 6-8 knee push-ups a few minutes before the main training. This will activate the right muscles and nerve cells  and increase blood flow to the working muscles. This part of the warm up is probably the most important!Main TrainingNow that you're warmed up and primed  do the main exercise(s) for the day. I advise you do to skill training at the very start  like when working on handstands. Follow this up with your strength stuff. In our example  this could be pike push-ups  or regular push-ups  or even a completely unrelated exercise like squats.Structure your work so that your main movements like squats and pull-ups are first  and things like core training  grip work and and calf training are last.
