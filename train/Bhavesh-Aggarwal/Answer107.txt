We're training for strength  not for acrobatics. If the two-handed handstand comes easy to you  work on making it one-armed. Incidentally  a complete rep of a one-armed handstand push-up has never been caught on tape. Maybe you'll be the first to get there?Muscle-upsThe ultimate complete upper body exercise known to man  bar none (pun intended). The muscle-up is a mixture of a pull-up  a leg raise  and a straight bar dip. I uses all of the muscles involved in those movements  and also adds a speed/power component to your upper body work.
