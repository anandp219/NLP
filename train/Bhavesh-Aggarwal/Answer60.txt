'Before I delve into the 'How'  allow me to give some "dos and don'ts".Do what you can handleIt seems obvious  but many people violate this fundamental principle. If you can't do an exercise right  you need to take your time and learn it properly before you run off chasing a high number of reps. There's no point practicing sets of 20 push-ups if you don't do them right. You'll only overestimate your strength  and end up hurting yourself  either acutely or over time. Learn the movement properly  and then work on making it yours.
