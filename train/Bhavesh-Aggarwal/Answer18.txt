For example  getting into the top position of a pull up  spend some time 'up there' before you come down. Do the same in the position where your arms are about parallel to the ground  and at the bottom position. You will get a feel for the entire pull up and build strength.GripSed Chapman often says one of the key reasons people can't do many pull ups or chin ups is their grip. This is especially a problem in the early stages  when you're capable of doing perhaps 4-5 reps. Try hanging from the bar for a while  without moving  to train your grip.
