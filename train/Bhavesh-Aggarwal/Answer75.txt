I recommend you to read up on the subject. Books like 'Starting Strength'  'Convict Conditioning (1 2&3)'  and many other will go a long way in providing you guidance where nobody else can. Look around and you'll find stuff that fits your situation. Apart from strength  you need to work on tissue quality  conditioning  and mobility. I will not go into these subjects  because there is A LOT of info on the net for free.And finally  here's my last bit of advice. You can improvise weights with a ton of different things in your environment.
