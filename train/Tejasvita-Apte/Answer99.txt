  The biggest benefit women have is lack of responsibility. I may end up riling some of you at the first sentence  but I request you to read further. Women are taken care of in any patriarchal system. When I say taken care of  I don't necessarily mean in a manner they would like. The point is  all the decisions are taken by men. What sucks is  women get no freedom. But freedom always comes with responsibility. When you take away one  you take away the other too. This lack of responsibility is also a form of convenience.
