Maybe the choice is between bad and worse  but it is still a choice. So  whatever you feel  helpless or not  you've got to do what you've got to do. And face the full consequences of that. You cannot choose the consequences. I take a lot of inspiration from Michael Corleone from the Godfather. I like him for this very reason. He never wanted to get into the 'family business'. But when he does  he makes a choice and takes the full consequences. He knows 'wants' don't always materialize. Similar is the situation in Mahabharata.
