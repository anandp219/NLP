  I can think of two theories here - 1. Every idea is original if you can come up with a new way of saying itEvery idea any person has  is built on something. There is no such thing as an original idea. So  find a new way of saying it. Old wine in a new bottle. 2. Come up with a novel idea no-one has heard of - How can you do that? Again  I don't have any such ideas but I can think of the theory of it. Something novel means something which is not heard of before. How do you come up with it? By thinking in a way that is not 'obvious'.
