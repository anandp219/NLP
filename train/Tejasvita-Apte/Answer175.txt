When you think it is unbearable and you fear you might actually take a step  call a friend. Or call your therapist. Give yourself half an hour. Distract yourself somehow. But in the long run  please visit a therapist. Remember again  one day at a time... One battle at a time... One moment at a time... While you are at  address one problem at a time too. Be safe and take help.
