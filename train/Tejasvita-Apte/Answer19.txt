And the idiots who make stupid comments are exceptions blown out of proportion. I remember just one memory about what RSS men do. Earliest memory actually thatis etched in my mind. I was about 10. My teacher's husband was deathly sick. He was in the Hospital for months. They were from Odisha and didn't speak Marathi. They had no relatives or people who could help. They weren't in financial trouble. Just that she had 2 small children and couldn't leave them alone or take them to the hospital 24*7.
