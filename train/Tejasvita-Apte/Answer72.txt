In any case  if you see closely enough  you will find a pattern. If all the child sees is disrespect and violence  he / she will either do the same or live in fear. Either of the two.Do not raise a child when there is mutual disrespect  violence and disharmony. While separation of parents isn't fun for any child  between living with parents who bicker constantly and separated parents  I'd say separation is better. If you are mature about the separation  if you do not treat the child like a possession and ensure that he / she knows that despite your separation the child will always be loved and taken care of by both  children understand.
