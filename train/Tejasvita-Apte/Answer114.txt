What's more  the most outrageous thing is that these religious nuts who start their idiocy as 'arbiters' and 'counselors' often end up starting a parallel judicial system which if their population increases  will pose a direct threat to a justice system which is based on rule of law. Many Muslim countries already have this problem. Countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan have Religious courts (presided over by the Taliban of course) dispensing justice posing a threat to their judicial system. Muslim in many European countries also insist on having these parallel judicial system which threatens sane laws.
