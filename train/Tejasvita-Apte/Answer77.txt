The classic paintings were nuanced  deep and very detailed. They had definitions  structure  methods  forms and a lot of intricacies. And then came Romanticism or even better  Impressionism! While it brings a beauty of its own  the classic paintings too deserve to be relished! But by now  we are used to flamboyant use of colours  impressions  reveling the beauty of the entire painting instead of taking the time to appreciate each stroke of a classic painting. So  to slow down  efforts are required.
