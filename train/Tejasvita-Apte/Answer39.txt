International Economic law covers different economic conventions and treaties. If provides a good foundation for International law which you will study the next year anyway. Personally I find International Economic law a tad bit difficult because Economic laws are not my forte. The others are fairly simple. When I was a student  I had chosen Trusts for its practical importance. P.S. The syllabus may have changed a bit and I am not very sure of all the laws that are covered under 'Women and law'.
