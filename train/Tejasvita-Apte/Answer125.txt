This is mainly to ward off the effect of the affair. You real work would begin months later. To assure him. To make him feel wanted. An affair tells him that he is rejected. You have to make him believe he isn't and would never be. He is needed  wanted. Remember  feeling wanted  is very different from feeling loved. And if you cheated out of this reason  you will very well see the difference. Lastly  forgive yourself. For Him (the person whose spouse had an affair) - 1. Victim of an affair need not necessarily be the victim of the marriage - Your first job is to not find out the details.
