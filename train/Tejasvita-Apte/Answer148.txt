  Thank you so much for asking me to answer. It was a great experience! Firstly  I have to say that the organizers as well as the students were very warm and welcoming. It felt great to be connected to so many people with common interests and an open and curious mind. Nagpur is a quiet city in the North of Maharashtra. I had visited it once before for a moot court competition in college a few years back. I was happy to be back there. The stay arrangement was excellent and so were the hosts. :) The whole experience of the meetup was superb!
