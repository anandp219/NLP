The politics is about castes. The problem being the fact that Babasaheb  sadly for them  is a Brahmin. A fact that should make no difference in front of his body of work. But like I said  what can you expect from puny  pathetic souls whose only reason of existence seems to be seeing castes in other people's surnames?Lastly (and understandably) that is all that they are capable of seeing and understanding. Reading his books requires a lot of effort and some amount of brain. P.S. Seeing my caste in my surname and writing me hate mails will prove my point.
