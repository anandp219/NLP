In a way  Modi's victory tells me that people haven't really been fooled by the pseudo secularism of mainstream media and congress party. Why does it have so many members & supporters if it is so bad?Because the people who support RSS have seen what it is like. They have known the people from RSS. They are not some crazy fundamentalists. They are normal people like you and me. And even when I don't agree with some ideas of the RSS  I don't demonize them. Because that's false propaganda. People realize there are countless good things they've been doing for a long time.
