I hope as hell the reader realized this and heeded the doctor. I want to know that my real uncle (Chacha) has expired so that my aunty is now in iddah so I want to know that who can talk with her or meet with her and can she walk on the roof? Now days in the market too many hair removable blade (RAZOR) available. Is it allow in Islam women can use to remove hair (pubic or else) or only hair removal cream is allow? please give answer in the light of Quran & Hadith Answer - A woman also can shave her pubic hair from razor; but since softness of the pubic area is desirable in women therefore it is better for them to use hair remover creams.I have quoted everything from the website of Darul-Ifta.
