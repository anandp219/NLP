One to be safe and secure  while the other is to fully expose ourselves and be vulnerable. Love therefore  takes courage. It mandates that we leave our secure shore  let our defenses down and take a plunge! The most essential need we all have is - 'To matter to someone'. In love  that is felt deeply. In heart breaks  that is what gets hit. But when you have seen and truly felt love  regardless of the heartbreaks  the person will always matter. And love will always feel worth it. Now  go find love.
