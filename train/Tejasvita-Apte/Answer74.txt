  Let me be honest and tell you  Classical music many times is an acquired taste. Personally  I was exposed to classical music since infancy. Apparently  I used to listen with a lot of focus.Then there came a stage where I was a fan of a lot of contemporary music and rebelled against everything old! That was in early teens. Of course I realized in about 2 years that my first love will be Carnatic Classical music! The other reason of my exposure to Carnatic Classical music was learning Bharathnatyam.
