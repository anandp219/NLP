  Wow. I quite connect to this question. I battle this feeling all the time. It is good that you are not suicidal. I have felt both the extremes. And I know that we have two options. One is to quit. Now that quitting could be either by actually taking your life  or resigning to feeling that life is a meaningless pursuit. The other is to give meaning to your life. And I use my words judiciously. I say 'give' meaning. Because it is our job. Life doesn't owe it to us. It tries hard though!! :)Life can only be as meaningful or as meaningless as we make it.I find myself going back to 'Man's search for meaning' by Viktor Frankl many times.
