Blindly so. You would never ever check her phone or anything else. You now know that it is possible for a spouse to be attracted to another and cheat. While it is hurtful to the other  it can happen. So  living on tenterhooks is pathetic. You will trust her to tell you if she finds herself straying again. And then the call would be yours. Whether to continue or move away. Know that she cannot make you trust her if you don't allow yourself to. If you constantly keep digging  neither of you can ever be happy together.
