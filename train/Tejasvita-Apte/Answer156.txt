The world cares a hang about your effort and children should learn that.When parents try to over protect their children and in the process don't ever have a disagreement in front of the children  they deceive them. They deceive them into believing in a world without disagreements while in reality it is impossible to find two people agreeing on everything. I think children should be taught to communicate disagreements without so much as raising their voices. Self assertion and considering another point of view are very important skills to learn and people later join classes to learn it!
