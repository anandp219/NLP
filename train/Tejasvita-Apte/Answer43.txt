I believe they are fairly clear and known. The important question is  how do we develop this ability. Critical thinking requires experience  practice and a lot of contemplation. I know a very nice Sanskrit term which can greatly help in learning to develop critical thinking. That term is - 'Saakshi bhaav'This means developing the point of view of a 'witness'. Removing yourself from the situation and looking at things. Creating the distance. I know (from personal  first hand experience) this is easier said than done.
