Everybody uses the arguments that suit them. Every body thinks they are following Dharma. So  saying Mahabharata was a 'Dharma Yuddha' need not necessarily mean that whatever happened in the war was right. It can possibly mean that the Yuddha (war) was a way of trying to find 'Dharma'. Seek it. Follow it. Everyone is trying to do it in their own ways.Who truly won and who truly lost... who is right and who is wrong... who is good and who is bad... What is dharma and what is not... Who's to say? You seek for yourself and find!
