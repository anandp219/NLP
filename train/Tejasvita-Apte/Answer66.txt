  Fascinating question. One that has haunted me time and again. Not just Karna  every commander of the Kaurava Army is killed by unethical means. Bheeshma is killed by bringing Shikhandi and exploiting Bheeshma's vow. Drona is killed by Yudhishthir lying about the death of his son which deeply saddens him and he gives up his arms. ( The famous 'Naro va Kunjaro va' scene) Karna is killed when he was disarmed. Even Duryodhana despite the Pandavas nearly winning the battle is killed by Bheema unethically.
