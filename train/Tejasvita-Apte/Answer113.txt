Give it a read  it is excellent. I always had this question as to who follows this and asks. I mean sure  a small percentage of adherents in all faiths were bound to be stupid. And hence  I had always ignored the issue. Until of course I read the stats. Until of course I realized that no Muslim is willing to challenge the legality of this hogwash. Personally  I have a huge problem with the fact that fatwas are considered as binding by many blind adherents of the faith. People from around the globe write to these enlightened scholars who then spend man-hours discussing clothes and beard.
