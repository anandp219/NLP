Each cell participates. Not just that  there is research suggesting that the thinking of music 'in the mind' tends to have the same impact on the brain as music itself. (I have a theory that this must be identical about sex too. That thinking of it  will have just as powerful an impact on the brain as the act itself. But I haven't read of such research on sex)There is also the theories and research about 'musical memories'. Tunes that are etched on our minds. Poems and songs we tend to remember only if we sing them in their tunes.
