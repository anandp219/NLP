I was happy today that the Bombay HC dismissed the ridiculous petition challenging the honour he is being given by the Maharashtra government. (Again  truth be told  this honour itself is thoroughly belated). What's more the HC has also asked the two Petitioners to pay costs for filing such a ridiculous petition. The award ceremony got over a few minutes back and watching the man speak so eloquently at 94 years of age  once again  was a pleasure! Any person who knows a little about the politics of Maharashtra knows that maligning Babasaheb is politically motivated.
