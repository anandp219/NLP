The resolution was regarding the Global Refugee crisis. It was an amazing experience to judge school students who had participated! I was a tad bit worried because I am used to judging (and grilling) college students (mainly law) in competitions. I am also known as quite a scary judge. (This apparently is the reason why I am invited I am told! LOL) But I was taken aback by how prepared and well versed the school students were. All in all  an awesome experience I will always cherish. :)
