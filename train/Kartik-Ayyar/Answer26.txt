Now you enable TACC by enabling auto pilot then overpowering the steering which is awkward.Sometimes autopilot keeps track of your previous speed when you disabled autopilot  vs. trying to turn it on with the current speed. So if you had it on in a 55mph freeway  and disabled it  and then moved to a 65mph zone  it enables auto pilot at what your previous speed was set to be.If you are on a street with weak markings  and there are no other cars  it can end up playing pacman. In general  be careful when markings are weak.
