I want my music listening to be private and never really discovered any meaningful amount of good music through their social activity feed.Spotify had a really simple way to star songs  but they made it more complicated. You could just like star song and have it added to an auto generated playlist  but then they changed it so that you needed to add it to a playlist  and they still kept the old starred playlist - one extra level of friction for what was a simple function I liked.Note that I work at Google  but as of this writing do not directly or indirectly work on the Google products mentioned above  and made the switch based by accidentally trying out Play Music to get a YouTube Music key subscription  and finding out it was better for my needs.The only Spotify feature I really miss is the native app.
