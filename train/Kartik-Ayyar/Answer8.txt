  The good parts:You get to interact and at times meet with some very smart people.You upvotes and content get more distribution.The not so good parts:The notification spam makes it much harder to use Quora:It's much  much  harder to consume content on Quora due to lots of notifications.There are some benefits  but unfortunately it comes with drowning in low signal to quality ratio notifications. I get way too many notifications of people following me  and way too many notifications of people up voting my content.These notifications make it harder to just see notifications of people writing answers about content I care about.
