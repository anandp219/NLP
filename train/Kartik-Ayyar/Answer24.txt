Beyond that  just remember it's mainly reliant on being able to see lanes  the car ahead of you and to some extent GPS and sideways sensors.It's not advertised as or meant to be a full self driving car  though it's a wonderful taste of that future today. I am terribly afraid though that some people will use it thinking it's magic and not read about and understand it's limitations.What are the cases it doesn't handle well ?Well  there are a few corner cases I've experienced where it's better to go manual though they are relatively predictable and well defined.If someone trying a sudden change into your lane  it's not as fast to react as a human.
