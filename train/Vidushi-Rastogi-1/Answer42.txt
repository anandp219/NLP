(I hope you know what are the aggressive breeds). Don't stare  try to look less threatening. Put up a smile; make subtle  friendly sounds and say hello. If dog seems responsive  you are good to go.Let the dog approach you  sniff and lick. It is just testing that you are not a threat. If dog wags tail  congratulations! you are pals. You may now touch its forehead  scratch its ears. You may also proceed to back. Rely on your instincts. Any discomfort bark  growl is signal to retreat.Don't make sudden moves or postural changes that dog might take as threat.If you are a nice person  dog might have started loving you already (:
