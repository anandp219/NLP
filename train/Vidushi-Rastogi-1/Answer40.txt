We are far from that. But that doesn't mean we are not progressing. Each discovery is a milestone and each clinical trial failure costs billions and decades. It takes approximately 15 years to get the therapy safe for deployment under registered practitioners. So the technology (sic) is not slowly advancing  it's just that you don't notice its silent achievements.
