Even if you don't like them. Just be polite  and professional. Be honest about what help they have given you. Tell them that you have enjoyed learning from them  and will take what they taught you to the new role. Think of something specific that they have taught you and be genuine. When you are interviewing for the new position  say positive things about your current manager. Again  people talk. And managers want team members who speak highly about them. If you bad mouth your manager in any way  your new prospective manager will worry you may do the same for them.
