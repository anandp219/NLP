Yet  Einstein never gave up his search for science and he had tremendous focus. According to Einstein scholar  Hanoch Gutfreund: "If one talks about Einstein in love  his most consistent love from beginning to end was science." Einstein married twice and had 3 children with his first wife  Mileva Maric. His first child  Liesel was born a year before they married  and quickly passed away. Albert and Mileva had two sons together: Hans Albert Einstein and Eduard Einstein.
