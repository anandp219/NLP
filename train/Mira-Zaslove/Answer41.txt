  If someone accosts you in a secluded area  and asks you to give them your money  give them what they want  and get out of the situation as fast as possible. If the person is truly only after the money  they will focus on the money and give you a chance to escape.In these cases  your goal is to stay safe  not to risk your life over a few hundred dollars. Most ATM's have transaction limits  so the thief is after a quick "grab and go" rather than a big score. They don't want to bring attention to themselves or cause too much trouble.
