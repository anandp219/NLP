It is more efficient for these platforms to operate  so sellers can focus on the goods they are providing  not the operations. Buyers will start to use the service when it's easier for them to find what they are looking for by using the marketplace  than by other means. Again  this requires sellers to begin with. Buyers and sellers will only start to use the service if they feel it is legitimate and provides security. They need to financially trust the system. To get sellers started on the system the service needs to have the backend financial system figured out.For example  sellers typically have a pain point accepting money -- It's surprisingly expensive and complicated to deal with accepting  processing and dealing with fraud associated with ACH  credit  cash  check and all the other payment options available today.
