Upper management praised my top people for their awesome numbers and blamed me for those not making progress. Frustrated dealing with lots of crazy problems  that other people created? Welcome to management! In sales  it's also clear who closed the deal. And typically  the harder you work  the more sales you make. The more sales you close  the more successful you are. Contrary to popular opinion  good salespeople typically work much harder than everyone else. They may make it look easy  but don't be fooled-- good salespeople are extremely hard working  mentally strong  and efficient with their time.Sales management  however  is not so simple.
