  It's perfectly acceptable and correct to write either. People will know what you are trying to say. The goal in professional communication is to be understood. "Please find the attached file " is more common  but not the only correct phrase. For example  if adding additional text  like: "you requested " it would sound more natural to use the later  "Please find attached the file you requested." It's always good to remove unnecesary words  so when in doubt cut "the" and just write  "please find attached" or PFA.
