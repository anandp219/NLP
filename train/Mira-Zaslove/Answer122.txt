His individual sales numbers still sucked  but his ideas helped to improve the team's performance. I could have easily fired him because his numbers were low  but instead I informally treated him as my sales manager and soon enough  his promotion was made formal. To my surprise  I also got another promotion. Not something that happens in traditional sales  when someone else performs well. Sales is often a zero sum game  where each sales person tries to get as much of the pie for themselves as possible  whereas sales management is about expanding the pie.
