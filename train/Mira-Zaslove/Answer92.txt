You dont want to draw a blank  or appear to have no interests  if they ask. Read up on current events  and have things to say to fill the empty space. Good topics include sports  popular TV shows like Game of Thrones  food  restaurants  and traveling. However  remember that this is still an interview  and you are trying to get a job. Steer clear of controversial topics. If asked your stance on something highly controversial  say it's a complicated topic and change the subject. Now is not the time to change your co-workers mind on gun control or vaccinating their children.
