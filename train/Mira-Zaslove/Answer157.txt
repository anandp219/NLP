The other side needs to feel confident that you are credible and you can execute. Again  I've seen a lot of different styles succeed. Some people  like Trump  appear larger than life and love to brag about how good they are. Yet  I've also seen people negotiate multi- million dollar deals by telling the other side how terrible they are at negotiating. Many top negotiators have different negotiating styles - but they all are confident and credible. It's hard to be a great negotiator if the other side doesn't trust you can deliver.
