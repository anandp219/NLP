A major challenge I had to overcome was to let go of the things I enjoyed doing and was good at. Things that got me promoted  didn't really matter as much anymore. As a first time manager  I wasn't prepared for the amount of grunt work. A manager's job is often to do the work that nobody else wants  or can  do. New managers will save themselves and their team time and energy if they quickly pick up the slack.Finally  I also learned that people are happier when they are busier  so it's necessary to keep your team busy.
