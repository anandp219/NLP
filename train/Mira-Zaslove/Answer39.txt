Don't even expose yourself to FOMO by looking at the high end options first. Another principle psychological principle behind FOMO is The Paradox of Choice. Schwartz wrote this FOMO credo  which explains that the more choices we have  the less happy we are with what we choose. Too many choices lead to anxiety and depressive FOMO feelings. The people most sensitive to FOMO  according to Schwartz  are maximizers  people who are always trying to get "the best" out of every situation. Maximizers are more prone to regret  and depression over the choices they make.
