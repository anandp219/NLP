It's already beginning to happen. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) also has had a record of launching highly successful and technologically advanced missions. Yet  it will not be easy  and the political task is enormous. Comparing India to Germany  Japan  and the United States is difficult. Germany has a population of around 80 Million  Japan around 130 Million  the US around 318 Million. And India has 1.25 Billion. China has a larger population than India  and Singapore is a newer state.
