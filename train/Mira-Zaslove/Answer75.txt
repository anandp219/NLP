These industries recruit heavily at the top colleges and tend to be more focused on collegial pedigree. Yet  the richest and most successful person in finance today  went to University of NebraskaLincoln.Similarly  if you want to go into a field that will require an advanced degree  your grad school will probably matter a lot more than your undergrad degree. Also  for me there is power in being underestimated. I worked for years in Sales & Trading in a fiercely competitive highly adversarial environment.
