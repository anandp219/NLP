Customers believe they are getting a deal  yet they are often just spending more for items they don't really want. Restaurants also often bundle their high profitability items with those of lower profitability to increase overall margins. Most restaurants sell a mix of items  and not all dishes are created equally. Industry convention groups them into:Stars: popular items with high marginsPlow Horses: popular items with low marginsDogs: unpopular items with low marginsPuzzles: unpopular items with high marginsExamples of stars include pizzas  pastas  and omelets  which are popular  and relatively cheap to make  especially in bulk.
