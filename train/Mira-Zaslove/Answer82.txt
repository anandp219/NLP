It is contagious. Don't be bitter or jealous. Make people feel good when they are around you  and when they help you. 4. It's never too lateReduce your goal to small manageable steps and reward yourself. Don't try to do everything all at once. Be methodical and have a strategic plan. Success is a marathon  not a sprint. I really like Bill Gate's observation here: Most people overestimate what they can do in 1 year and underestimate what they can do in 10 years.History is filled with successful people who reached their dreams later in life.
