  Dealing with co-workers you personally dislike is  sadly  a common problem. The best way to deal with it  is to ignore them  and keep doing your job. Focus on yourself  and your work rather than on people you dislike.A few things to keep in mind:1. Don't talk badly about themYou may not like somebody  but chances are someone likes them or they would not have been hired. Also  the person you dislike  may be good at their job. Some workplaces are more political than others  and some cultures can seem like popularity contests  but stay out of it!
