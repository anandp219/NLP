He is not the richest man in the world  but he has billions  and someone like him may well be in the top spot. I couldn't find this guy on Google  and on paper he barely exists. His wealth  properties  and investments are held in multiple layers of shell companies  trusts  offshore accounts  foundations  and holding companies  which were not linked to him directly.Political and royal figures also have ways of hiding their money  and can largely keep the value of their wealth a secret. For instance  Vladimir Putin's wealth is a subject of hot contention.
