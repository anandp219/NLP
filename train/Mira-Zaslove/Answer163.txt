Thankfully  after I got the promotion  my boss stayed out of my dreams. So  a recurring person who keeps showing up in your dreams could reflect a feeling or desire that has not been successfully resolved in your waking "real" life. Unresolved feelings are uncomfortable and we tend to replay them in our subconscious minds. People you see in your dreams can also signify the future and something you are excited about. Jung believed dreams can provide prospective images of the future. For example  when I first got pregnant  I had a few vivid dreams of a baby.
