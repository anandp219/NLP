Which sometimes it is. However  top negotiators are not trying to win an argument. Their goal is not to prove a point. Their goal is to get what they want. Top negotiators are able to focus on the outcome. They know what they want  and they go into a negotiation prepared to get it. Bad negotiators are ill prepared  and often don't even know what they want. If you don't know what you want  you aren't going to get it! And just as important as knowing exactly what you want  is understanding what the other side wants.
