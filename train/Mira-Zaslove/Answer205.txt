Toxic people who constantly e-mail  text  guilt  and berate you will zap all of your patience. Stay away from them. Spend your time with people who make you feel better. Life will be much simpler  and you'll be much more calm and patient when you are surrounded by good people who have your best interests in mind. If you can't completely cut out toxic life-complicators (family  managers  or co-workers  etc. )  don't stoop to their level. Ignore toxic people as much as possible. Don't waste time gossiping or fighting.
