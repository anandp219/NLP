Visa issues can prohibit opportunity and limit job prospects. The US distributes visas by lottery  and the number of H-1B is capped by Congress. The process is complicated and limiting. Once you graduate from your MS program  and are looking for a job  you will need your employer to sponsor your H-1B visa. If they want to hire you  it won't typically be a problem. Especially in the Bay Area. However  the company does have to pay additional money (approx $2-5K) and generally make the case that you have specialized skills that an American doesn't.
