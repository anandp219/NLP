At this point in my life  it rarely  if ever  matters. A lot of people have never even heard of Brown  or most of the other fancy schools your peers are bragging about. A handful of schools have strong universal recognition  but prestige tends to be more local and based on your field. For instance  the Iowa writing program  and the Santa Barbara physics program are both top in their respective fields.If you want to go into something like Investment Banking or Management Consulting straight out of college  it will probably matter what college you went to.
