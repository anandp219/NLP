For instance  the wealth of Queen Elizabeth II is also largely a secret. Officially Forbes values her wealth at $500 million. However  just one of her private residences -- Buckingham Palace -- is estimated to be worth $5 billion. Wealth of this magnitude is also highly illiquid and very difficult to sell. So how much wealth does Vladimir Putin and the Queen of England really have? If not a secret  it's definitely not so simple.
