  Starting October 6  2015  McDonald's will offer breakfast items all day at its more than 14 300 U.S. restaurants.McDonald's will also simplify it's all day breakfast menu. They will offer a more limited number of favorite items  including sausage burritos  hot cakes and  depending on location  Egg McMuffins or biscuit sandwiches. Until October 6th  McDonalds stops serving breakfast and starts serving lunch at 10:30am  Monday through Friday  and at 11am on Saturday and Sunday. Yet  because restaurants are in different markets and are owned and operated by independent franchisees  hours will vary  and depend on location.
