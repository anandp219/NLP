Talking bad about someone you dislike will only make you look worse  and distract from your work. If you are in management (or want to be)  you should be viewed as unbiased  and able to get along with people on the team. Finally  people talk and likely it will get back to the person  which will only make your problem worse. 2. Don't engage with them If you can  move teams. Spend as little time with them as possible. It's exhausting and draining trying to work with someone you dislike  so minimize your interactions.
