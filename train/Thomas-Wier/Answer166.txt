So if we do a historical search for the rise and fall of this construction  what do we find? It turns out that the construction appears to be rare or nonexistent before the 1840s  and rises right when German immigration to the US begins to rise:(This is a search specifically for texts of American English -- the construction is much rarer in British English  though not nonexistent  and follows roughly the same pattern.) The answer appears to be that the construction already existed in American English before the large-scale immigration of eastern European Jews in the last two decades of the 19th century.
