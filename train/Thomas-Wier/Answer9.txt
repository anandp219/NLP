  Joseph Boyle's answer is basically right: some regions of the world have geographical features  such as mountains  river or dense forests  that disfavor communication over long distances. Because communication is more limited in such places  there is less chance that the form of language used will spread or influence other neighboring languages or dialects. Such regions become residual zones  with linguistic diversity increasing faster than language death and language replacement can decrease it.But it is actually possible to be more specific about the relationship between the location of linguistic communities in the Caucasus and the region's geography.
