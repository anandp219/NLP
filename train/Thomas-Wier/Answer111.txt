Georgian  bai 'garden' and  angarii 'the bill  the check' certainly come ultimately from Persian  but it is not clear whether it was borrowed through an intermediary language. Words from Arabic often are borrowed like this through an intermediary source: Georgian  ekimi 'medical doctor' ultimately comes from Arabic hakim  but was probably borrowed via Turkish because of the vowel-harmony in ekimi. One last source of loanwords in Georgian is Russian  in which most Georgians are still fluent and which still influences their speech.
