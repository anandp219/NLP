  Unless you are not a native speaker of English  there's no sense in talking about 'recommending' how to speak  since all native English speakers speak (their own form of) English correctly  ipso facto. Some native speakers use themself as the reflexive form of (singular) they  while others (including me) use themselves for reflexive they  whether singular or plural reference. However  it's worth pointing out that this reflexive form of singular they is directly analogous to other originally plural pronouns that are used as singulars.
