It's also notable that these two meanings were conflated in one word  though this is no more surprising than any language having homophones  like the multiple meanings of English 'set'.Thus 'Alba Longa' means simply and rather prosaically "tall mountain". [1] Note that not all words that begin with Al- are related to this root. Many Spanish placenames come instead from far more recent Arabic loanwords with the Arabic definite article al- prefixed  such as Albacete  which originally was Al-Basit 'the plain'.
