  Joshua Engel definitely gets it right: English is still fundamentally  functionally a Germanic language. I'd just like to add though a more abstract point  and this is that when we say two languages are related to each other  we are making a claim about their historical phylogeny  that in effect at one point the two language communities spoke the same language. We are not in fact necessarily saying anything about their current functioning today -- their lexicon  their grammar -- at all. (For more on this  see my earlier answer: How close are French and English?)
