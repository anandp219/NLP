  To a certain extent this idea that ergative constructions (in which the object of transitive verbs are treated the same as subjects of intransitive verbs) are somehow 'primitive' is little more than exoticizing myth: people from where we are from don't speak that way  so it's those people who are weird. Obviously  the people who actually live in Australia or the Pacific Northwest of America or the Caucasus can't be remote from themselves.Nonetheless  it is true that the distribution of ergativity is skewed toward particular parts of the world and not others.
