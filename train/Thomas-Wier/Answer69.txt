This combination of size  population and wealth means that America can be in some sense a world unto itself. It is thus not so much that Americans think they are so great; rather  they are just much less dependent on the rest of the world than virtually any other country  and this gives them a kind of self-confidence in the correctness and propriety of their civilization that other countries that are historically or currently more insecure do not have.But there is another reason  and this is that  in comparison to most other major countries of the world  for most of the last several centuries  so much has gone right in America.
