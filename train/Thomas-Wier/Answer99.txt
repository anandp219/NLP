  The short answer is no. This is because writing is not merely a means of communication  but rather a visual system that represents the actual properties of spoken human languages.As I explained in a previous answer (When did the oldest written language start as compared to the oldest spoken language? )  true writing evolved first among the Sumerians only after a period of pictograph-like signs that represented tokens for trade came to acquire determinatives that represented actual grammatical formatives in speech.
