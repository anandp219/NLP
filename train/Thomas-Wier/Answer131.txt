Only 13 languages -- mostly European ones -- change the word order to indicate questions. That puts English  German and Dutch in the 1% of language weirdness  for that feature. [2]Although at one geographical end of the family there are some really quite weird languages all clustered together  at the other geographical extent we find quite the opposite  languages with rarity indices lower than 1.0. Most of these languages are Indo-Aryan languages of India. Cysouw doesn't go into much detail about typological mundanity (he's writing about rarity after all) but his work does point to an important conclusion with respect to the OP's question: with respect to language typology  Indo-European does not really function as a single cluster of traits  so there really aren't traits common to all (or even most) that are not also shared by some languages elsewhere.
