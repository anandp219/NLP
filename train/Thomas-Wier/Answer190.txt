  In essence  it's because the exact conditions under which Germans arrived in the United States were very different from those which modern Hispanics find in the American Southwest. As I noted in another answer (Given that the United States is a nation of immigrants  how did the English language come to dominate the nation? )  the first English settlers created a founder effect (Founder effect) on language use within the colonies:A founder effect results from an expansion of a diverse population into new areas  resulting in lower differential diffusion of features in those new areas.German settlers arrived late (the earliest small groups coming only in the 1680s or so)  and tended to arrive in small groups of individuals or small families  only rarely creating large self-contained colonies.
