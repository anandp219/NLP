This is true of the perfect forms of 'say' and 'tell'  and the present forms of carry and 'take something'. But it's even more complicated when you look at the full paradigms of some of these verbs. Consider the future paradigms of 'go away' vs. 'go (about)': SG PL SG PL(2) 1 mi-val  mi-val-t da-v-i-vl-i da-v-i-vl-i-t 2 mi-x-val mi-x-val-t da-i-vl-i da-i-vl-i-t 3 mi-va mi-vl-en da-i-vl-is da-i-vl-ian 'I will go off  you etc.' 'I will go about  you etc. 'Here  the root in just one form -- the third person plural of 'go off' -- is used for the entire paradigm of 'go (about)'  so that one verb is regular  while another is irregular.
