  There are a number of misconceptions in this question  and in some of the other answers here. This is because ergativity refers to a pattern of alignment in language  and is not a property of particular nominal or verb forms as such:What we mean by alignment is that the individual arguments of clauses are usually marked in some way to indicate who is acting  or who did what to whom. In intransitive clauses  there is only one actant  but in transitive clauses there are two or more actants  and usually the single argument of an intransitive clause will be marked for a given feature (person  number  gender  etc.)
