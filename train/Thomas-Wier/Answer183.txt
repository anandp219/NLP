What is taught in schools  and in popular books for laypeople  is the same as it was in 1900  and much the same as it was in 1800. The public is denied all of it.In other words  there are plenty of otherwise educated  intelligent people out there who simply are ignorant of the way the world actually works. If we taught grammar in public schools like we taught chemistry  people would have a better understanding of what language is  and how it functions.
