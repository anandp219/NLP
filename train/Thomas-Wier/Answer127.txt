An analogy of this last scenario would be Britain  whose inhabitants now mostly speak a Germanic language  English  but whose original inhabitants as far as anyone can tell were Celtic speaking in the earliest attested records. The name was simply adopted by the invaders for themselves  even though they had nothing to do with the original inhabitants. Something like this definitely did happen to the Hittites: they called themselves Nesites  but the previous occupants of the land were Hattites  and the Hittites' kingdom of Hatti was named after them.
