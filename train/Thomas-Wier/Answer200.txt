  If depends on how you do the counting. In some languages with alphabets  like English  French and German  digraphs and trigraphs are not counted toward the total number of letters in the alphabet. English has a total of 36-37 phonemes in most dialects -- 24 consonants and 12 or 13 vowels -- but has to make do with a measly 26 letters to represent those distinctive sounds graphically. In other languages  such as Spanish  digraphs are actually treated as distinct letters and words are alphabetized accordingly: a word that begins with <ch> goes toward the end of the dictionary in Spanish  not the beginning  as in English.
