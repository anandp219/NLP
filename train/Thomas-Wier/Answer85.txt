In general  if a language has pronominal intensifiers  it will be identical to the SELF-type reflexive  not the SE-type. Dutch is maybe the most famous example of a language with such a distinction:(4) a. Jan waste zich. John washed SE  b. Jan waste zichzelf. John washed SELF  Both: John washed himself. (5) a. *Jan haatte zich. John hated SE  b. Jan haatte zichzelf  John hated SELF  John hated himself. Other languages that have a SE/SELF distinction are German  Swedish  Norwegian  Icelandic  Greek  and Georgian.
