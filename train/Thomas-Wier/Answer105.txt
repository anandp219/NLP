  Answering this question is not easy for a variety of reasons. First  Georgians have a bad habit of essentializing words in their language as 'Georgian' (or: Kartvelian) or not  as if a word that has been used for a thousand years is not sufficiently Georgian enough to count as part of modern Georgian usage. This is true even of Georgian intellectuals and academics  who are educated enough to know better.Second  as Irakli Kavtaradze mentioned  in part because of the first problem  there is no one etymological dictionary of all words that Georgians actually use.
