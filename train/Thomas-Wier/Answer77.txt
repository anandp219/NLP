a scene during the Taiping RebellionSo you can see from this sad litany of historical tragedies and human suffering that America's history stands in a wider global context. In that context  the bloodiest war in America's history  the Civil War  killed a comparatively small 700 thousand people. Because Americans have lead relatively peaceful lives over the last 400 years  they were able to engage in  as Thomas Jefferson put it  'the pursuit of happiness'  and institute governments structured around the rule of law and  increasingly  democracy that now the world over are considered the hallmarks of a civilized society.
