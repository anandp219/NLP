But to see that you first have to understand how gender works in Tsova-Tush. Like other Nakh-Daghestanian languages  verbs agree with the gender of the subject (if intransitive) or object (if transitive)  and the agreement depends on the specific combination of markers in the singular and in the plural:Thus  to say 'the boy is'  you say k'nat va; but to say 'the boys are'  you say k'nati ba. This is because the noun k'nat belongs to the first gender  while other nouns have different patterns of agreement.
