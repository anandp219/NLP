Ossetic has instead innovated an almost entirely new system with a discrete number suffix followed by one of nine case suffixes (again  mostly unknown in IE). Here for example is the paradigm for 'house' (with the Georgian equivalent for comparison):Ossetic Singular PluralNominative xzar xzar-tt- 'house/houses'Genitive xzar-y xzar-tt-y Dative xzar-n xzar-tt-n Allative xzar-ma xzar-tt-amAblative xzar-y xzar-tt-yInessive xzar-y xzar-tt-ySuperessive xzar-yl xzar-tt-ylEquative xzar-aw xzar-tt-aw Comitative xzar-ima xzar-tt-imaGeorgianNominative saxl-i saxl-eb-i 'house/houses'Narrative saxl-ma saxl-eb-maDative saxl-s saxl-eb-sGenitive saxl-is saxl-eb-isInstrumental saxl-it saxl-eb-itAdverbial saxl-ad saxl-eb-adVocative saxl-o saxl-eb-oAs you can see  this  too  somewhat resembles the Georgian system  in that Georgian also lost an original number+case suffix and replaced it with separate number and case suffixes.
