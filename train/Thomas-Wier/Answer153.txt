This new subset is not necessarily 'simpler' (as in the chart)  just less diverse.In comparison to their mother countries  these dialect regions were all formed very very quickly: it took a mere 250 years for English to spread from Virginia to California. Compare that to the British Isles  where English did not really begin to replace Celtic languages in Scotland and Ireland for more 800-1000 years after it first showed up there.A corollary of that is that these dialect regions are very big: English across most of North America  Spanish all the way from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego  Portuguese from the Atlantic almost to the Andes.
