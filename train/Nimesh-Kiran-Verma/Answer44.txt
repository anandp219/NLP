My mind started bouncing over stuff which my eyes could look on  stones  frogs  lake  stars  moon  sky and finally landed on myself.I thought about my incapability of expressing oneself  and through the past experience somehow concluded that it is not good for me and from that day on I decided to express myself freely.And succeeded in doing so in few years!Many things (both good and bad) might not have happened had I remained that plain vanilla boy!Many years from that lone reddish dusk under the tree  I now again find myself all alone in a luxurious hotel.
