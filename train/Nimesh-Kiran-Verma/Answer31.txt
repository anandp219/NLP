'Vasudeva said  'That car  O Arjuna  had before been consumed by diverse kinds of weapons. It was because I had sat upon it during battle that it did not fall into pieces  O scorcher of foes! Previously consumed by the energy of brahmastra  it has been reduced to ashes upon my abandoning it after attainment by thee of thy objects! 'On Rahul Kawadkar's Suggestion"Each attack by Arjun was pushing back Karna's chariot by ten paces while each Karna's attack was pushing Arjun's chariot by two paces. Throughout this duel  Krishna kept praising Karna saying "Bahut Khoob  Karna."
