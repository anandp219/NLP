In order to kill that fear you must take actions that help you become reassured that you are well prepared (like taking additional courses  learning new skills  writing a good CV....etc)The main reason people remain afraid of the future is that they never dare to respond to their fears by taking actions but instead they ignore the warnings and try to forget about them.As long as you ignore the sources of your fears your subconscious mind will let them grow in order to draw your attention to them once again.
