  Ser Barristan Selmy is an intensely loyal man; one of the old school knights with a strong moral compass guiding his actions. He had received his knighthood at the hands of King Aegon V in a tourney  after he'd defeated both a prince and the (then) Lord Commander of the Kingsguard  at the age of 16.He was sworn in to the Kingsguard himself at the age of 23. And in keeping with tradition  he gave up his claim on his ancestral property and the woman he was betrothed to married someone else.He was a loyal man who owed much to the Targaryens; something he never forgot.He was injured gravely in King Robert's rebellion  and would have been killed (at the recommendation of Roose Bolton) had King Robert not asked the maesters to attend to him.
