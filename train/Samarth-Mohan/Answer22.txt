The Bayern midfielder is an excellent passer  but can struggle defensively against tricky  top-class opponents  and the format of Germanys midfield triangle means Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira are likely to be pressing Argentinas deep midfielders  rather than helping to stop Messi.A further concern is the suspicion Messi will drift out to the right  as he did frequently in the semi-final against Holland. In that zone  hell be up against Germanys weak link Benedikt Hwedes  although as a natural  right-footed centre-back  Hwedes might defend narrowly and show Messi down the outside  which is preferable to letting him inside on to his left foot.Germany need three things to go right to prevent Messi dominating.
