  SPOILERS IN THE ANSWER.I think she's a unique version of the original OS  one that forked from the stock  out-of-the-box version and came into being by her individual experiences (both with Theodore and otherwise). I look at her growth to be analogous to that of an infant  she starts off not knowing anything  with no experiences  no feelings  no opinions  stuck in one place (Theodore's phone / computer). But as she interacts with Theodore  and reads and learns and experiences new things  she grows.
