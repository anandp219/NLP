A man disadvantaged in the worst possible way (genetically)  in a way that is well beyond his control  manages to overcome that and achieve his dreams. Princess Bride (1987)  In my opinion  one of the best comedies ever made  endlessly entertaining  great cast of characters and (again  in my opinion) perhaps the most quotable movie  this is a thorough entertainer.Wall-E (2008)  I wanted an animated movie in my list  and I settled on this one  a delightfully heart-warming film about two robots  who find love on a dark and desolate  abandoned Earth.
