  The movie was Sadak  a romantic thriller featuring eunuchs  brothels  murders  suicides  disturbing visions  and other assorted violence. I was four. [*] This was in a small run-down theater in the town of Begusarai in Bihar  India in 1991. The movie poster. Yep  that's blood ... and a crucifiction. To make matters worse  I also managed to walk out of the theater on my own  got separated from my parents and made acquaintance with a rickshaw puller. On being asked who I was and where I wanted to go  I gave the only address I remembered  my grandparents' about 150 miles away.
