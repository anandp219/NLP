  It was extremely difficult to prune my list down to three. I managed to bring it down to five (okay okay  six) and then chose quasi-randomly.Gattaca (1997)This is easily my most favourite sci-fi movie. A man's struggle to beat his genetically coded inferiority in his quest to fulfill his dream of space travel makes for a compelling watch. I just love how Ethan Hawke works with single-minded determination  leaving no stone unturned to overcome his genetic "disability".Donnie Darko (2001)I recommend people to watch this movie with reading up as little about it as possible.
