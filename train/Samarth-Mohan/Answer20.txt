Films have cinematic and time restrictions; cinematic in that they have to make sure the 2 hr 30 min version of the story lives up to the expectations of the nitpicky reader as well as someone who hasn't been exposed to the books. This often creates a situation where no group of viewers goes home satisfied.When you read a book  you are only restricted by your own imagination while when you see a movie  you are experiencing it filtered through someone else's.
