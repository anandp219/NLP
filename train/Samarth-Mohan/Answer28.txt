  Watch The Wire. It's an incredibly dramatic show  with a gritty and realistic portrayal of the Baltimore drug scene with powerful performances from the whole cast. And given that it's 5 seasons are over  you will not need to delay gratification. =)Alternatively  if you're looking for something slightly different  I highly recommend Luther. It's a British psychological crime drama that follows the "inverted detective" format. Luther  a character inspired by both Sherlock Holmes and Columbo  is a dedicated  obsessive  and possessed policeman who often finds himself consumed by the darkness he's trying to fight.
