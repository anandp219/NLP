  First  a product is never finished  so get that idea right out of your head. What I see here is a lightweight MVP at best. When that is complete you'll need to start building the real product. There is a lot of hidden complexities not obvious in these mocks. For instance I see an RSS feed button. And there is some sort of notification thing going on. I didn't see UI for how that works. What triggers that  how are they viewed  how are they dismissed? Profiles?This is probably a minimum three month job for the front end.
