I watched two grownups work out their problems and stay together. In my experience  many folks whose parents got divorced don't really believe in marriage. They don't believe it can work. They're aways expecting it to fail  and they often push it to failure  so at least they'll have some control over what they see as inevitable. I know marriage can fail. But I also know  from evidence I saw with my own eyes  that it can work! (And if I ever got married again  I would only marry someone else who believed they can work  too.
