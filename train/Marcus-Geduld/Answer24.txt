You can go swimming in the arctic ocean. You can tease a cobra until it bites you...The truth is that various substances affect our bodies in various ways. Some "natural" substances help us; some "natural" substances harm us; many "natural" substances help us in some ways and harm us in others; some "unnatural" substances help us; others harm us; and many others do both.
