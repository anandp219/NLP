  I was an admin on this site for several years  and I never did what I wanted  which is why the site still has a boring white background instead of black with beige with polkadots. Sigh. I was not allowed to delete questions without a reason. I had to explain my reasoning to the other admins  and when doing so  I had to cite a specific policy. The site kept a record of every admin action I took  and other admins could (and did) read through it. Often  we didn't take action  because after a week or two of discussing a single question or answer  we couldn't agree about it.No  of course you don't have freedom on Quora.
