  Yes. I don't generally eat mammals. That's an arbitrary decision  and it's not morally perfect  but I'm slowly crawling towards veganism. The exception to my no-mammal rule is when I or someone else makes a mistake. For instance  if I order cheese pizza and get pepperoni pizza by mistake  I'll go ahead and eat it. The animal is already dead; the pizza is already made. If I don't eat it  the restaurant will just throw it away. (I guess the best thing I could do in that circumstance is to give it to a homeless person  but I don't generally do that.
