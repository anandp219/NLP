  Well  there are tricky things about it for people who come to it other languages that are very different from Javascript. Javascript is object-oriented  but it uses a different kind of object-orientation than most other popular languages  such as C++  Java  and PHP. If you're used to the more-common form  you'll be confused by the JavaScript way. I actually think JavaScript's approach is simpler (or at least no more difficult) for someone who learns it as his first programming language (or as his first object-oriented programming language)  but for JavaScript-as-second-language folks  it can be a brainfuck.
