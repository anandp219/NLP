Sight plays a role  but the final result is a composite--and it's not stable. If you one day find out that the man you like is a pedophile  he may stop being attractive to you  even though his looks won't have changed. You won't see him as a good-looking child molester; you won't see him as an average-looking one  either. You'll see him as an ugly one. Looks matter to most of us  but mostly as a default. Our experiences and knowledge of a person change our first impressions.
