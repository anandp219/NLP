If you can be easily tagged--Christian  atheist  conservative  lesbian  woman  etc--you will attract bullies who feel the need to fight with "them.") So if I've framed an interaction with you as a fight  argument  or competition  I will want to win it. Note that the same conversation might not be competitive as far as you're concerned  but my actions are based on my context  not yours. Even if you've never criticized me  I may be (from my point of view) in a fight with you  because you said something that made me feel stupid.
