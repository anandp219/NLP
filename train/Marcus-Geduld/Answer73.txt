Ask me how to create instances of objects  and I can show you a whole bunch of different ways. And I love the variety  because I can pick whatever method I think best suits a task  but that's a bit overwhelming for newbies. When I was starting out  I often wanted to scream  "Just tell me the right way to do it! "There's another tricky thing "about" JavaScript. I put scare quotes around "about " because this isn't really a tricky thing about the language itself. The problem is the ecosystem it exists in.
