We have many that are great in some situations and not-so-great in others.There's lots of evidence to suggest that we have (at least) two impulses when it comes to coupling  both of which are equally natural. One is to play the field and the other is to pair bond. There is nothing strange about us having conflicting impulses. Humans and other animals have them all the time. It may be irritating  but we aren't optimized for happiness. Having conflicting impulses is a core trait of our species. Often  conflicting impulses wage a tug of war that creates a kind of stability.
