That's most-often what the stalker wants--a win. I'll post something that upsets him  and he'll try to win by using logic or  more often  by making a short  cutting quip. Quips don't affect me  and if I agree with the guy's logic  I'll generally say  "You're right." But if I don't  I won't. Most of what I discuss on Quora is stuff I've been studying for years or even decades. I don't believe I'm infallible  and  in fact  people here have changed my mind about stuff I thought I knew well  but it's not likely to happen via a quick "logical" argument  because over the last 30 years  I've probably heard that argument hundreds of times before.
