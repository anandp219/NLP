Sometimes  when I'm on the subway platform  and it's super crowded and noisy  I have a natural impulse for more space (our ancestors--with whom we share a brain structure--did not evolve in crowded cities  and we're not optimized to live in them)  and I felt the urge to push people onto the tracks. I didn't do it. I am not saying it's wise to throttle all our impulses. I'm saying "it's natural" is a weak argument for doing or not doing something. We have natural impulses that are great; we have others that are not-so-great.
