  Are you asking when women stop looking like the "hot chicks" you see in movies? If so  we should start by noting that most women don't look like them to begin with. Here's the best answer I can give you: if we show people photos of 1 000 women--each of whom is displayed at various stages of her life--and demand that all the viewers classify when the women changed from being "hot chicks" to an "old ladies " refusing to let viewers use any other categories  my guess is that we'd get a range from about 35 and 60  depending on the individual woman.
