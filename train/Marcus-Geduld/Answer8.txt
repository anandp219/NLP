It gives no advice. Rather  people are born with various impulses. Some of which are counter-balanced by other impulses (instinctual and/or learned). Nature seems to have "advised" me to to steal things. Just last week  I was at a friend's house  and I saw this big wad of cash on his dresser. I had a really strong impulse to take it  and that impulse felt completely natural. Gaining resources adds to my chance of survival and reproduction  and in our society  money is a resource. But I curbed my instinct.
