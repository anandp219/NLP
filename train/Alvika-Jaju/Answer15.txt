  Okay! Lemme see... would I mind it? Emm emm emm...NO! I'd love it! :D 1. He cares how I look. Unless guys are fashion designers it's usually tough for them...I would highly appreciate it.2. If a dress is too revealing and he asks me to cover it. I'll feel he wants that only he gets to see the detailed stuff. Which I feel is absolutely adorable and loving. He doesn't want to risk a dirty eye on me. I'll just fall hopelessly more in love with him.3. If he asks me to dress in a certain way with his parents.
