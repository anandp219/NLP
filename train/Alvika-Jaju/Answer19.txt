Don't worry. 1.Just let go. Accept what happened and start afresh. 2. You love him. So go express your love. Celebrate his birthday. Love is NOT a business deal to be equal. Do whatever you feel like doing irrespective of what he did for your birthday because you love doing things for him and that makes you happpy (let go of being selfish and you'll feel how wonderful itll be).Celebrate being together.You're lucky to be with the one you love. Cherish it.
