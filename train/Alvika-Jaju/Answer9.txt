Love and live for them. Don't cry over someone who didn't want you. The biggest myth is "cannot live without him/her" . It may be tough for a while but it's your choice to crumble to pieces or come out as a survivor.Be a survivor. You will find someone who values and loves you. Maybe she might come back. But cross that bridge when you get there. Being with someone who is fickle minded about wanting you or not is NOT something I can bear. I do appreciate her a LOT for telling you honestly!It's time to love yourself more.
