  In the simplest and rawest example I can give.1. Hitler was great. I don't think he was happy (he committed suicide). One of the Greatest men in history.2. A baby is happy. He is in no way great! His eyes  smile  laugh  cheeks  body language is all happiness... just pure happiness.3. Most important story! Alexander the great! And yet when he died he spread the msg:1. I own wealth of the world... I carry none to my grave.2. No doctor could save my life.Having said that (ponder over that) why can't you have both.
