So yeah ideally you shouldn't ask. But dick heads will be dickheads <Ifyouseewhatididthere>.Ask her directly but gently.You might see her first sex time blood or you may not. Girls don't bleed like river. Some get it more on the sheet  some while they pee after sex and some don't bleed enough to get noticed.You might go in for "so is the seal intact? ""Is the warranty void? ""Is the profit holding up or leaked out the loss? ""Has the shield protection been avenged? ""Is the apple eaten?"Akkk! Gotta go vomit due to the question I read.Somebody get me an Aspirin!
