  Then you must (should ) be:1. Sucking at giving up!2. Sucking at being sad all the time!3. Sucking at Sucking! We all have goods and bads...Else all goods would make us saints. And that would be so monotonous.Just wonder: As a baby did you give up trying to walk because you 'sucked' at it? Everything in life is like learning to walk... you stumble at first  fall  bruise too. AND when you learn it it's all a smooth ride! Eventually we all learn. Keep trying  have faith and be patient... you'll get there.P.S.
