  Unless you keep it bottled in then it's great that you don't get angry and scold.Yes  the negative is that you wouldn't be taken seriously always.And being taken seriously is by being stern... not scold people. I went out for lunch today. While taking my change after paying the bill I found Rs.2 less. Everyone told me to let it go. I didn't. I returned the bill with change he had given me and asked him to check the balance amount correctly! I wasn't rude. I didn't shout. I wasn't even stren. I silently made them check something which could have happen erroneously too.And believe me...
