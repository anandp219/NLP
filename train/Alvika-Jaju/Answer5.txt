  Dear Anonymous  I'm extremely sorry. I wish I could hug you. I'm sorry to say this but as of now and for the details you gave when she has clearly stated that you move on. Do it. Move on. Cry  cry your guts out. Move on. My personal suggestion. You may take it or leave it  I don't know her nor you. It's extremely tough to say anything. It's your life  your decision.I follow this   "Never be where you're not wanted  never.Never be with who doesn't value or want you.Kick the person out of your life who treats you like now-needed-tomorrow not needed.
