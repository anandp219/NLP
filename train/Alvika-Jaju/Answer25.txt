I've to be strong in front of people  IT'S JUST SO TOUGH!I don't express sometimes for the fear of being misunderstood.4. My grandma is suffering from Cancer and probably won't survive through it  and I can't spend time with her.5. I have expectations from myself and ones I have to live upto.There are days I wake up feeling "another battle day" and gather hope to live through it. Put a tired forced smile. Just the other day I was telling my mom "If I am to die now  I wouldn't stop it. I'd have unfinished works and regrets but I wouldn't stop it.
