I expect that you will let me follow my religious and cultural activities  and my personal habits - and I will let you follow all yours. I do not expect you to change a thing in your life for me. I understand that our ways of life are different  and things I hate might be part of your habit and vice versa. I will let you do all those things I consider against my religion as long as you don't force me into them as well. I expect that you will not make me change my personal life just because it goes against your religion.
