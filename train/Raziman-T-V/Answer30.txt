  Indian athletes and sportspersons end up close to last in many Olympic events. Rather than being ashamed of them  we still support them and award them sporting honours. The list of Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and Arjuna awardees consists of multiple individuals who failed to win a medal at the Olympics. But they are still the best we have got  and they have done their best at the highest levels of the competition.The case of Indian ACM ICPC teams is not very different.I was in a similar situation a few years ago.
