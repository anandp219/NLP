In the question details  you talk about stoning women in Islam and barbaric sharia laws. Who stones women in India in the name of Islam? Sharia laws considered barbaric are usually criminal laws  and India has the same criminal law for everyone.The third reason is that movies do talk about problems with Islam which matter in India. OMG talked about all religions  and Dharam Sankat Mein talked about the Imam trying to force conversion. Fiza and Shahid were about Muslim youth joining terror groups  and Nikaah was about the issues with the Islamic requirement that a divorcee can remarry his wife only after she has been married and divorced by another man (The Malayalam film Ghoshayaathra was about the same issue).
