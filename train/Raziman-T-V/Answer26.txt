I have no clue how to keep both groups. Good luck with the balancing act!Seriously folks  stop getting worked up about vote banks. Every individual gets one vote  and they have their own reasons to vote. Every voter has different needs  and expects different things from their government. If you plan to form a government  it is your job to provide people what they need the most. People don't become a vote bank when they don't vote for you just because you can't provide it.
