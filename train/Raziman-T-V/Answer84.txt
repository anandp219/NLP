The way I see it  they are happier to lose a few prolific contributors who act like this than alienate an entire group of people. I believe that this is the right thing to do too. There are lots of spaces on the internet where you can say absolutely horrible things about individuals and their identities with no consequence  and I am glad that Quora is not one of them. I have not felt that the policy violation banhammer falls on Indians unjustly and disproportionately. If there are users who you feel have been banned unjustly  go through their edit log and you will probably be able to figure out why the ban happened.
