BJP grew up as the political wing of RSS  but it is time to reform the RSS and the Sangh Parivar. It is high time that BJP started controlling RSS instead of the other way round. VHP and Bajrang Dal are not making you any dearer to the minorities. Deal with those groups and their leaders like Pravin Togadia sternly.Try to attract Muslims at the party level and mentor them politically. If you have active Muslim members at the grassroot levels and sufficient number of Muslim faces at the state and national levels  it will help you reach out to more Muslims who are not yet open to the idea of BJP.Finally - and most important - go for inclusive development.
