Burj Khalifa weighs 500 000 tons. The total gravitational attractive force between the building and the earth is thus mg = 5  10 N. The radiation pressure force that the sun exerts on the earth is thus weaker than the gravitation force due to one building on earth.Meh.Notes:[1] This is for a perfectly absorbing surface. For a partially reflecting/transmitting surface  there will be an extra pre-factor which we neglect since this is an order of magnitude estimate. [2] We are treating the effective area of the earth as a uniform disk.
