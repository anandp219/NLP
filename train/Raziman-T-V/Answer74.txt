  This is a tricky dynamic programming question.Let us start with a naive DP solution of high complexity.Definewin(i j k)=1 iff player i could have emerged as the survivor after battles involving only players in the clockwise range from j to k (that is  if j>k  the range wraps around n)Clearly  i has to fall inside [j k] for win(i j k) to make sense. Also  the clockwise range is taken as linear even if it spans the full circle. For example  if n=5 and j=3 k=2  the range looks like [3 4 5 1 2]; and 3 cannot fight 2 until everyone in between has been defeated.We need to find a recurrence for win(i j k).
