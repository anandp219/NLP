The problem is thus all about picking from a set of lines the line with the lowest height at a certain x-coordinate.Consider the above image as example. We have four lines [math]l_1 \ldots l_4[/math]. Initially  it is [math]l_1[/math] which is the lowest line. Then [math]l_2[/math] takes over  and finally [math]l_4[/math] becomesthe winner. For the given query location [math]x[/math]  [math]l_2[/math] is the line with the lowest height at that point.So how do we find the lowest line for the points efficiently?We will make a few observations.
