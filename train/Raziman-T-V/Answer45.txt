Except for those indulging in proselytizing  Muslims in general do not go about denigrating Gita or comparing it with the Quran. Since they don't read it and don't consider it something to follow  the question of respecting the teachings is moot.Muslims do have an issue with Gita being imposed on them as a part of saffronisation of education though. Why wouldn't you just keep your religious texts to yourself?
