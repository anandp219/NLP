Look for Action (items on discount) or the M-Budget items (which are essentially permanently on discount). You should be able to obtain most spices there too  and the more exotic ones can be purchased from the Asian stores. Cooking large-scale and having multiple meals (or sharing with others) would be the way to go. This should be quite cheap - even if you eat non-veg  you can reduce the price per meal to 4CHF or less. I cook my royal pairing - chicken biriyani and shrimp roast - for 7/8 meals with around 30 CHF.Sticking to this routine  you should be able to keep your food expenses per month under 250CHF.
