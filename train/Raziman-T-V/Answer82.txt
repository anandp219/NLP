Some users who write very good answers on some topics indulge in appalling racist/sexist/homophobic behaviour in other topics  and often make personal attacks. I have reported content from multiple top writers for violating policy.In that way  users' actions on Quora mirror the real world. How many times have we seen very respected individuals at the top of their fields end up saying absolutely uncivilised things? Many prolific users end up doing the same on Quora too. This is not just about your views being controversial.
