The situation would have been very different if the earth were a thousand times more massive.In fact  the orbital speed of Jupiter around the sun is just 13 km/s  whereas its moon Io orbits Jupiter at 17km/s. As a result  it would be seen as retrograde from the sun.Notes:[1] We assume here that the orbitting object is much lighter than the other  and that the orbits are circular. When these conditions are not satisfied  the equation becomes slightly more complicated but the results do not change qualitatively.
