Seriously  this has got to stop. No party can come to power in India on Muslims' votes alone. And Muslim votes are no more or less misguided than Hindu votes in India.Now that we have established that Congress does not come to power "riding on the Muslim vote bank" How do Muslims feel when Congress comes to power?Well  the Muslims who voted for Congress would have felt pretty good - just as the Hindus would have. Running the country is serious business  and it is nice to see the people you voted for doing it.
