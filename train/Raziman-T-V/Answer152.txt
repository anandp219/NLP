I would like to see movies questioning religion itself rather than religious practices. I would also like to see more movies about Muslims in India in general  rather than just having them as sidekicks or villains. Movies can be a strong vehicle for social change  and our society will be well served by well-made movies talking about issues with both Hinduism and Islam  such as caste system and oppression of women.PS: I haven't been watching movies for quite some time  and I have absolutely no idea of movies from most other Indian languages.
