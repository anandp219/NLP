  Indian movies rarely criticise religion itself but just certain social aspects of religion which have a negative effect.Think about the recent movies which have caused much outrage : PK  OMG - Oh My God  and Dharam Sankat Mein. These movies do not criticise Hinduism in its entirety but only practices such as godmen and wastage in the name of religion. OMG even has Krishna as a main character. Essentially  these movies only talk about the flaws in the present interpretation and practice of Hinduism but do not question the idea of Hinduism itself.
