With this base case and the above recurrence  [math]\rm{DP}(n \{2 3 5 \cdots 53\})[/math] gives the minimum cost.ImplementationSubsets are usually represented by bitmasks in dynamic programming. If set [math]S[/math] has elements [math]a_1 \cdots a_n[/math]  its subsets can be represented by [math]n[/math]-bit binary numbers. The bijection between subsets and bitmasks is that element [math]a_i[/math] is present in the subset iff the [math]i^{th}[/math] bit of the mask is [math]1[/math]. For example  the subset [math]{a_1  a_3  a_6}[/math] corresponds to the mask [math](100101)_2 = 37[/math] (Bits are read from right to left).We start with the set of primes under 58.1int p[16]={2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53};In our solution  we require the factor set for each number.
