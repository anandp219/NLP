In places like Kerala  the issue of tolerance did not even come up since even Hindus eat beef. And in many parts of India  Muslims and other minorities have been abstaining from beef partly out of tolerance and partly out of fear for their lives.Political Hindutva wants to extend that last state of affairs to the rest of India. It is all about enforcing the will of one section of society over the others. There is nothing about religious harmony or tolerance in this. I had written a similar answer on this topic.Basically a cow is a material item and not a purely religious object.
