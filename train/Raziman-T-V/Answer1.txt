  Yes  I would let a doctor who got in through reservation treat or operate me and my loved ones.Here are the reasons why:1. The medical entrance examination tests candidates on a lot of things which are completely irrelevant to their career as a doctor.Take a look at the syllabus (pdf) for AIPMT : There are many topics like electromagnetism  thermodynamics and botany which have nothing to do with the knowledge or skills a doctor requires. Many physics topics would be difficult for students who are weak in mathematics but would make excellent doctors.
