Also  the need for a large military became moot after the US military umbrella promised them to secure their resources. Hitler went after Russia to secure oil in its south. Japan went after SE Asia to secure iron ore and other raw materials. Post-WW2  both nations got all their major resource access protected by US and this provided very little rationale for war. In some sense  western nations pay an implicit tax to the US in return for US fighting wars to protect all of their trade routes and raw materials.
