  One thing I want to add to Luke's good answer is that it also depends on which class & locality you are born in. If you are going to be born as a poor villager  then India is likely worse than Vietnam  Iran and China. India's healthcare  sanitation and primary education is terrible if you are poor.If you are going to be born in a rich  urban family India is the best place to be in. Ultra rich often face trouble from the party in China and face slightly more security issues in Vietnam. A rich Indian can have an outsized power in the society  have access to great education & healthcare and can also greatly utilize India's fast growing economy.
