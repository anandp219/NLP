  In 1947  when India was partitioned there was a lot of pain and confusion. Millions were uprooted and hundreds of thousands died. It was the biggest human tragedy in Indian history. Confused and angry  many mistakenly blamed all this on the Mahatma as he was the biggest target they could find. They thought he had the power to stop the partition [he didn't] and he had the power to stop the violence [he did stop a vast chunk of it in the east].For many on the Hindu right  Mahatma was seen as soft towards Muslims.
