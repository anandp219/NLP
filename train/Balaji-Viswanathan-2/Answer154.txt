Skin is a good indicator of a body's health and thus people do all sorts of things to make the skin appear good to "prospective mates". In some places  tribes would abandon their children or even kill if they were born light skinned (Persecution of people with albinism). In other places  being born as dark skinned would bring discrimination. It is all about what each society thinks of being healthy. And in modern world most often these are stupid intolerance.
