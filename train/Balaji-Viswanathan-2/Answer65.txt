We have team outings  team meetings  dressing around the company's logo/colors to even have songs and anthems.We feel proud because we are wired to feel special bonds with the groups we live in. Nation is just one of the dozens of groups/identities/badges we wear. Such bonds  pride and loyalty helps teamwork and social order and thus widely encouraged.
