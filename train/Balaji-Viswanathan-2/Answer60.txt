In India  the resource price is higher and might go for a chauffeur driving a manual. Most Indian families do fine in the US as they quickly adjust to the new society as above. They don't miss their maids and chauffeurs much.Things get tricky when you have a child. Unlike dishwashing or vacuuming  childcare cannot be automated and thus it is fairly hard to raise kids. You need to constantly look after them  run after them and clean after them. This is where many Indians miss labor abundance back home.
