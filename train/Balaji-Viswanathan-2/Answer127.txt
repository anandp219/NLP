  It is just unfortunate and a game of politics. It can also be counterproductive as the left wing academia might be playing all its cards too early. That group is going all-in and staking all its credibility on an issue in which the central government has very little role to play. And most importantly  it is the nation that provides them the award. I feel they are insulting the nation for very little fault of them. For the first time since independence  the left wing academia has very little hold over the government and its only playing hand is when Modi is visiting abroad - especially the US and UK.
