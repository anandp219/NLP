  I took a negotiations class around this topic once and I will try to bring ideas from that and other sources. First  a protest needs to have an objective. What outcome do you want out of the protest? That objective forms the end condition for the protest. "I would stop protesting  if I get X." This X must be spelled out clearly. For instance  when Airtel tried to break net neutrality we protested with the objective - "remove the recent VoIP tariffs". Without a concrete objective for a protest  it is running like an headless chicken.Second  the objective needs to be reasonable.
