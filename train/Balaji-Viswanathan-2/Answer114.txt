  A big factor is the Kissinger's diplomacy in the region that time. In their massive geopolitical game with USSR  US was blinded on its own key principles - killing democracy in Iran and Afghanistan  helping the French fight freedom fighters in Vietnam and helping Pakistan unleash a major genocide (1971 Bangladesh genocide). In the process of helping Pakistan during that genocide  Nixon made India very insecure  forcing it to go nuclear. While India was always interested in going nuclear  the key event that tipped the balance was the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war.
