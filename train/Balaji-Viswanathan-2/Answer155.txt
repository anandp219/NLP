  When I went to buy my first car  the dealer gave me a 0% loan for 6 years. That ensured that he got my business that day [selling the car] and for a few years to come [maintenance  supplies] and even the potential to sell the next car a few years down the road. Seller financing is a prominent business strategy where the seller closes the deal by offering sweet financing. A lot of major businesses do that. And so do many countries. Japan does that  China does that and so does India on a smaller scale [prompting questions like why India provides aid to Nepal etc].In India  Japan and China are fighting to dominate the world's hottest rail market.
