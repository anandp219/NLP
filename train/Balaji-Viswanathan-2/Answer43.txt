There is the "Greater Nepal" or "Khoarsan"  "Mughalistan" etc. If a sizable chunk of India is joined with Nepal or Pakistan or whatever other country  that resulting county would be Hindu by the sheer size of Indian population. Thus  Indians would be the dominant population in that "Greater Nepal" and they would legislate a variety of things that Nepalese might not like.
