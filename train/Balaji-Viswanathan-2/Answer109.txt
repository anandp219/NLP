Mahabharata is a treatise on leadership and the moral dilemma they face. Killing  spying are all "unethical"  but necessary to protect your people. If Mahabharata was just about "follow the rules and you will be fine"  it will not be an epic. Real life cannot be reduced to a mere collection of rules and morals is the key lesson of the epic. Sometimes you have to make tough decisions to make and no matter what you it will be ethical. As a leader  you can break some of the rules if the intentions are right.
