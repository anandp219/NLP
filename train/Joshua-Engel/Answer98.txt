What you're reading is the latest headling-grabbing equine excrement kicked off by somebody's misreading of a heavily caveated and carefully limited scientific paper (frequently  with the complicity of the university's own PR department). Whatever magic ingredient they're telling you to include  or leave out... honestly  just punch them in the face. That's the best dietary advice I can give you. Whoever is telling you that  they're just bad people  and you can improve the diet of the entire planet by just breaking their nose.The problem isn't with "scientific advice".
