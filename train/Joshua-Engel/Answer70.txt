  Well... my reaction varies. I was a "Trekkie" when the term didn't have quite so many negative connotations  a time when Star Trek was three seasons and a cult classic. None of the other series have had nearly as much impact on me  not even Deep Space Nine  a show I found most interesting in ways that it had nothing to do with any of the other Trek shows. The thing that makes "Star Trek" special for me was a moment in time that can probably never be recaptured.I sure wouldn't mind if there was a completely new thing  the way Ron Moore (who had a heavy hand in Deep Space Nine) completely reinvinted Battlestar Galactica into a far more intersting thing than its original form could possibly have ever been.
