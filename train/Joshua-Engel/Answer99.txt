The problem is with non-scientists dispensing advice that sounds scientificky. Journalists aren't scientists. Anybody who writes "  PhD" after their name on a book cover isn't a scientist. (Take a look at a book by  say  Stephen Hawking. Note the way he doesn't say "Stephen Hawking  PhD"? That's because he's an actual scientist  and is recognized as such by other actual scientists who know that a PhD is the bare minimum qualification in the field  not a badge of general expertise. Frequently  the guys who write "PhD" after their names on book covers have a PhD in an unrelated field.)
