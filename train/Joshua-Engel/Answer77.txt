  > If matter is energy condensed to a slow vibration It isn't. Matter is energy in the form of fermions (half-integer spin particles)  which obey Fermi-Dirac statistics that prevent two particles from occupying the same space. That provides the "takes up space" part of the classic definition of matter; the energy takes up the rest.So the rest of the question is moot. Notions of "illusion" and "nothing" and hand-wavey "existence" are new agey philosophical bullcrap that should be terminated with extreme prejudice  and add nothing to the conversation.
