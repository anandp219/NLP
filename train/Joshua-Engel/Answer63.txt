  Yes  though only because people eat so much refined sugar. You can get cavities equally well from unrefined sugars  from natural sugars in fruits  and even from starches (which are turned into sugar in your mouth by enzymes in your saliva). But it's relatively rare these days for people to eat just those things and not refined sugars  so that's the main cause of their cavities. If they ditched the sugars they'd get fewer cavities  but not zero  since the other foods also feed the bacteria that produce the cavity-causing acids.Proper brushing with a fluoride toothpaste will dramatically reduce cavities.
