Scramble it  fry it  boil it soft or hard... these are trivial things to do. You'll get better at them and produce better results  but even the lousy results are edible.So instead I will talk about pasta. Again  this is brain-damage simple:1. Put a lot of water in pot.2. Add some salt  about 2 teaspoons per quart. (Eyeballing this is just fine).3. Put put over heat.4. WHen it boils  put noodles in pot.5. Turn down heat if water starts to spill over. 6. Stir occasionally to keep things from sticking  every couple of minutes.7.
