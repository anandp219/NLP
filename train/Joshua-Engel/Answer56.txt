It might change its schedule by a few days. But that affects the other organisms which rely on them for food  for pollination  for keeping populations in check  for breeding grounds  etc. Species they depend on may not be there  or in different numbers; species they'd like to avoid (due to disease  predation  competition) may move in. There may be droughts  fires  etc. at rates different from previous. These effects will be far larger than the species' own response to the changed temperatures  and those will in turn cause more changes elsewhere in the chain  feeding back on themselves.Some ecosystems may substantially collapse  and species go extinct.
