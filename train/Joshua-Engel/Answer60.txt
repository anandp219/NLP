That destroys the quantum state of the electron. (The electron is still there  but you've forever lost whatever quantum state it had. )Now  you can take B (which is entangled with A)  and interact it with some other electron somewhere else. To do that  you need to know the result of that measurement  in order to know what kind of interaction you need. (To oversimplify: you need to know something about B  which you learned during the interaction with A). Now the electron is a perfect copy of the original electron  without having to send it.But that doesn't really sound like teleportation to me.
