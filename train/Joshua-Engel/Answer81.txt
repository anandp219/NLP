Just for the state of 11s and 9s I listed first there are [math]\frac {10!} {5! 5!} = 252[/math]   and that's before I got into all of the others.So of all the states that the system could be in  the overwhelming majority of them have the energy distributed nearly evenly  which means it will be low. That's what it means for objects to have a tendency to be in a low energy state. Note that it's really a bulk property of objects; it doesn't really have a meaning for a single particle by itself.
