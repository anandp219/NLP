If the advice comes down to "Eat more veggies and less crap"  then it's scientific advice. The rest of actual work on nutrition is trying to fill in the details  which cover a lot of baffling issues that nobody understands very well  sure as hell not enough to say "Eating X diet is going to fix all of your problems". Most real detailed work by nutritionists is for people who have very specific issues and need special help; you'd need to see one to get specific advice. Preferably  one recommended by an actual doctor  not some quack who laid out a shingle.
