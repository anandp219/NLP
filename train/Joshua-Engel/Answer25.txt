"Exact time" and "exact position" don't actually exist. What does exist is a harder-to-grasp thing called a "wave function"  to which you can apply operators like "position" and "momentum" and get out a range of answers. Those answers just happen to turn into ordinary notions of time and space at large scales  with single values  but at small scales they are actually functions. That's what the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle tells you. Wrestling with that puts you in a better position to understand why your intuitive notions of what it means to be "the origin of the universe" need to be dismissed if you're ever going to get to what you actually want to know.Unfortunately  while it's a helpful tool for building better intuitions  it's not nearly sufficient to understand what the universe was like at the very earliest times.
