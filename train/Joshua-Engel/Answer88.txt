  It's a form of mis-generalization  not entirely different from the process that gives us "irregardless".English absorbs words from many different languages. Sometimes  it absorbs just the root and forms plurals in the regular way. Other times  it imports both the word and the plural  yielding irregular plurals.Some Greek words ending in "-is" form the plural by adding a vowel  "-eis". When filtered through American pronunciation  this becomes "eez". For example  the plural of "analysis" is "analyses"  pronounced "analaseez".
