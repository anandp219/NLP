  It's a great show. I've seen him in concert  twice - once in Napa and once in Houston. The first concert was after his album Let Them Talk and the second after his album Didn't It Rain.Hugh Laurie is a talented singer and musician and he's supported by the excellent Copper Bottom Band. He cycles back and forth between the guitar  piano  and just standing at the mic.Hugh is extremely knowledgeable about early American blues  jazz  and bluegrass. The concert is mostly those types of music and he accompanies the songs with interesting stories about the originators.
