Ah  well.If you're really concerned with anonymity  you can look for names that are unique but still have an obvious nickname that's common. This way your child can choose to go by this nickname if he/she doesn't like having a unique name. For example:Wilson is fairly unique  but your child could go by Will.Johnson is unique  but your child could go by John.Jennette is unique  but your child could go by Jen.Aliana is unique  but your child could go by Ali.Names like this offer "brandability" as the default  but the option of anonymity.
