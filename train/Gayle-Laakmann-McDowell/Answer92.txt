Period.Of course  in the business world  you can use Google. But interviewers don't ask you a question to figure out if you could solve this question in the real world. They ask you to derive some information about you (your depth of knowledge  your problem solving skills  etc). From there  they make a guess at your ability to do the work.You cheated. You gave them a false impression of your skills because you broke the rules.Nothing will ever remove the fact that you cheated. It already happened.
