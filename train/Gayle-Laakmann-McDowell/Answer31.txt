  For our son's first birthday  we did a book-themed party. We enclosed a note inside the invitation saying:There's one small requestThat won't be too hardPlease bring a book Instead of a cardWhether Cat in the Hator Winnie the PoohYou can sign the bookwith a sweet note from youA few people brought gifts as well (or instead)  but most people just brought a book.I don't think anyone thought it was rude. It made sense  given the book theme. And it probably made things easier for people as they didn't have to look for an appropriate toy.
