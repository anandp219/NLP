No text speak or sloppy punctuation. I can absolutely forgive grammatical mistakes caused by being a non-native English speaker. But if youre adding spaces before periods or not capitalizing words (or Capitalizing random Words)  thats just being lazy and unprofessional. If youre lazy and unprofessional  Im unlikely to try to help you professionally. Why bother  if youre not doing what you can to help yourself?Get to know them -- in person. An online connection just isnt the same. Make it really  really easy for the other person.
