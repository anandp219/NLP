I ration food that many parents would consider fairly healthy (eggs  whole wheat bread  milk  fruit  etc).The parenting books say that you should let your kid eat whenever they're hungry and that those are healthy choices. Kids know how to control their appetite. Yes  that's true in most situations. Lots of people have told me that I don't need to worry so much about what my kid eats.But my kid will overeat into obesity and those foods  while healthy in many respects  are very high in calories.I have a friend who really pushes her kid to eat.
