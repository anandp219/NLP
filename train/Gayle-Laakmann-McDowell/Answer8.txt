It's nice to save yourself the memory usage. (Additionally  if your interviewer adds this constraint to the problem  then they may be looking for something beyond just throwing in an if-statement at the end. )ReadabilityYou've used nested loops where the inner loop modifies the outer loop. Yuck. It makes it look like you have an O(N^2) algorithm  even when you don't  and makes the flow of the program confusing.If you are going to do this  I'd actually rather you use not use "i" as the iterating variable on the loops.
