Find some comfortable but fitted tops. Find makeup that works for your skin  even if you don't wear it everyday.If you do decide that you really don't want to care about your appearance  recognize what you're giving up. You're giving up something that will help you in many parts of life. It's okay to not leverage that advantage  just like it's okay to not leverage your network for a job search and it's okay to not work hard in school. You don't always have to take the "smart" path.Just make your decisions for you (not to spite anyone else) and with a full understanding of the consequences.
