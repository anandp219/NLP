  As much as people are dismissing this question as obvious  it's actually more complicated -- or at least ambiguous.1. What do you want to mean by saying that you're  say  two months pregnant? I feel like that should reflect "I got pregnant two months ago." However  one could also count from the start of your last period  which is how the number of weeks counts.2. How many weeks are in a month? A lot of people say 4  but this isn't true. An average month has 4.35 weeks (365 days / 12 months per year / 7 days per week.With those two definitions agreed upon  this will compute the number of months: # months = (# weeks - 2) / 4.35.Therefore  34 weeks is 7.36 months pregnant.
