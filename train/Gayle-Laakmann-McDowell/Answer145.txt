Nor should it. So even if sexual abuse were found to "change" someone's sexual orientation  that doesn't mean that the current gay conversation therapy would work.Correlation doesn't imply causation.Let's suppose that there's a correlation between being sexually abused and being gay. Does this indicate anything about sexual orientation being changeable? No.Boys and girls realize they're gay at different times in life. Many report always knowing that they're "different"  and some report knowing that they're gay from a young age (7ish in some cases).
