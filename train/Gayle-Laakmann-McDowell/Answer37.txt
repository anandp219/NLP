1234567array = array of intscount_product_occurrences = 0for x in array: for y in array: product = x * y if binary_search(array  product): count_product_occurrences += 1This code will take O(N^2 log N) time. That's because the for loops go through O(N^2) iterations  and each iteration does an O(log N) search.There are an infinite number of examples like this. Perhaps you feel like these examples are cheating or bending the rules of the question. Maybe... if you define the question to be as follows: Are all nested for loops O(N^2) where:The outer for loop iterates O(N) timesThe inner for loop iterates O(N) times  for each iteration of the for loopThe outer for loop only does O(1) work  other than the inner for loopThe inner for loop only does O(1) work.In that case  yes  those should be all O(N^2).
