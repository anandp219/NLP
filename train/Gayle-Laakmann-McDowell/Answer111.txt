He posted an anonymous question looking for career advice. Who cares? Nothing he said was even particularly negative about Zenefits.The Zenefits CEO made himself look like a jerk. I knew nothing about the Zenefits CEO prior to this  and I really don't think it's fair to generalize from a single action. But other people will. He looks naive: he's unaware that name brand is a factor in most people's decisions. There was nothing unique in this candidate's thought process.He looks immature and arrogant: he buys wholeheartedly into his mission  so he expects everyone else to -- even people who haven't joined.He looks like he's dodging responsibility: rather than accepting that he/his company might not have adequately sold the vision  he blames the candidate for not buying in sufficiently.He looks unempathetic: he's unable to look at it from the candidate's perspective and see that the candidate is being reasonable.He looks callous: revoking the offer  and doing so publicly  was mean.He looks unprofessional: there were much better ways of handling this situation  as I've explained here.
