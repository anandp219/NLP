Now  I'm not saying he is these things. I don't know much about him and I'm not going to generalize off of one incident. Maybe this is a weak point for him  or maybe this just caught him on a bad day. He's human too  and even CEOs of A-list startups make mistakes.But to people quicker to judge  he looks like all of these things. That's why this was such a stupid move.Also  can I just say... when it's you vs the Uber CEO  and you are the one looking like a jerk  you know you screwed up.
