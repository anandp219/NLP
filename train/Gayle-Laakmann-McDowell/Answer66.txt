  While I understand where you're coming from  no  it's not re-writing history. In fact  it'd be frankly weird to not update the pronouns. This is essentially how we handle everything else. People say "Gayle McDowell worked at Google". But McDowell is my married name  and I was "Gayle Laakmann" the entire time I was at Google.Someone might say "I met my husband at my friend's 25th birthday party " but at the time he wasn't her/his husband. Names and pronouns are just "pointers" to the person. They typically reflect the current name and pronoun  not the name or pronoun at the time.
