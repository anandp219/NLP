  You dont ask someone to be your friend. So why do you ask them to be your mentor?Think about your closest friends  or even your less close friends. When you asked them to be your friend  what were your terms? How often would you hang out? What would you do? What would the expectations be on each side? Oh. You didnt do any of that. You didnt ask them to be your friend. That would be weird. Plus  how would they know if they like you before they know you? Its a sort of ridiculous question to ask or answer.But somehow or other  you just became friends.
