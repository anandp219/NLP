  Talk to him/her as much as possible. Don't use baby words unless you want him to learn baby words.Point out some simple objects: ball  mama  dada  etc.Listen carefully to what they say. They may be speaking in their own language. My son calls buses "ma" (no one knows why). It's not a real word  but it's his word. It counts! You don't need to use their makeup words with them  but you should respond as though they're saying the real thing.When they start being able to speak a bit  avoid yes/no questions ("Do you want to read a book?")
