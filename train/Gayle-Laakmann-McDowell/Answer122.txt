What's important for women  for the tech industry  and for the country is sending a message that everyone is different.As a woman -- in tech -- with a young kid and another one on the way  I can say that the expectation is definitely not "oh  you must go back to work ASAP." That's the expectation on fathers.We don't need another woman sending a message that it's okay to not work  permanently or for an extended period of time. That's already the norm (at least within highly paid jobs). Society has that message  loud and clear.What the US needs to learn (again  in highly paid jobs) is that you can't generalize all women and that  yes  some women can and will go back to work immediately.
