So let's review. If I tell you the name I've picked  I walk into one of two scenarios:Best case: no change / mild relief. Worst case: walking around with the knowledge that you don't like my baby's name -- and possibly even turning me off the name enough that I need to choose a new name.It's a no-brainer: Keep the name a secret. Only tell those you know will happily lie about how much they like the name.After the baby is born  people are considerably more tactful because  hey  what's done is done.
