  The design is important to the extent that it affects the ability to easily grab the highlights and other essential content from your resume. Few recruiters would judge you (at least consciously) on the design of your resume  unless design skills are important for your job function.As far as the "CareerCup template": there's nothing special about it. It's just a boring  normal template. It's designed to be able to fit a good amount of content on it and to make it easy to see the key details (job titles  companies  etc).
