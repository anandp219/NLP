"Recursion and Dynamic Programming" should be before "Sorting"  since sorting uses recursion.Within "Knowledge Based"  C++ and Java should be discussed adjacent to each other and before Databases.Within "Assorted Review Problems"  moderate problems should obviously be discussed before hard problems.So then I just applied a straightforward topological sort to get a linear ordering.I presume this is the standard algorithm for all authors to decide chapter ordering... right?Okay  fine  I didn't really draw this out.
