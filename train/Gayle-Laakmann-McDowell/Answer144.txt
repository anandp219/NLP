Gay conversation therapies aren't opposed because they're ineffective. Many things are ineffective yet don't earn the amount of hatred that conversion therapies do. Gay conversion therapy is despised because it's harmful and often done on a child without their consent  during a particularly vulnerable point in their life. We should oppose this even if it did sometimes work  or even if it could potentially works. Being gay isn't harmful.Additionally  it's worth noting that gay conversion therapy presumably -- hopefully -- doesn't operate via sexual abuse.
