Maybe you just fell into friendship by hanging around each other enough. Maybe there was something specific that connected you  like having children the same age. Maybe someone introduced you two because you just moved to their city. Somehow or other  nothingness evolved into friendship.Like friendships  mentorships  the ones that actually exist  not the ones that exist in name only  rarely start from a formal request  and certainly not from a near stranger. It doesnt work for mostly the same reasons.
