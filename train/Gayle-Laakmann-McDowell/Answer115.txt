  I don't know how many babies were negatively affected by it. The number is probably a lot higher than 17  but a lot lower than other countries (as it wasn't approved in the U.S.).The articles I've read have hedged a little on the number. They'll usually say that only 17 babies were shown to be impacted  which is different than saying only 17 babies were impacted.Note that health and other statistics are typically difficult to compare across countries  as the methodology for reporting and labeling is different.
