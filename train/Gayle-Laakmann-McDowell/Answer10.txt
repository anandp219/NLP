But if you really argue that you don't want them  then you should be consistent here. You have spaces sometimes  but not always ("i<input.length();").You declare the StringBuffer in the beginning  but then you have a (potential) return right after it. Why not just put the StringBuffer declaration after it?There's no reason to have the bulk of your code wrapped within an else statement. It's okay to do one-line if statements (actually  I don't love them  but I use them in the book for compactness)  but don't mix a one-line if statement with a multiline else block.The first if-statement is actually totally unnecessary.
