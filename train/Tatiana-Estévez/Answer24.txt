If I couldnt do the work  you know because I had like 4 other deadlines for that hour  theyd actually be super polite  but then they wouldnt give me any other work  even if I was quiet  it felt like I was being punished. Eventually I got the message  you cannot say no in this company. I had been given the remit to increase the amount of work we did this was to be done by not just working for this small department but the whole segment. Im excellent at networking and within a short space of time I managed not to just increase to the whole segment  but the whole company  unfortunately to my detriment.
