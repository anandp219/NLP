  In most offices you know where you will be sitting every day  it will be a desk that is allocated to you and you know that until youre told to move  you can go to that desk every day. In most offices they will allow you to even personalise your desk area to some degree. Hot-desking is when an office doesnt allocate desks for its employees and you will be expected to use a different desk on a regular basis. Any personal items or work related items that you regularly reference will be stored in a separate area  usually some kind of cabinet or drawer.
