The first few days he was super polite  but within a few weeks  he was emulating the way he saw engineers treat me. I remember one afternoon  he hadnt yet taken the post to the post office (one of the few jobs he had to do). I went up to him and he was leaning back on his chair and had his feet up on the desk and wasnt inclined to take them down just because I was there. I asked him if he was going to take the mail to the post  he made some dismissive comment and the other engineers laughed. I went to get the post for him and by this time he had stood up and was still laughing  he stopped laughing though when I threw the entire bag of mail at him.
