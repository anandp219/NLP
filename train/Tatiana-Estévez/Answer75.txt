This can be really useful when you dont actually care about getting the job. All the benefits may seem unlikely  but two of these are potentially very rewarding  for the cost of a little time which you have effectively lost anyway. If you do decide to cut it short  you do risk annoying the interviewer  which may be a problem for you if you ever want to work in the company again  or any company that the interviewer may be working in in future. It is amazing how small the world can be and how many faces you wouldnt have expected ever to see again cropping up.
