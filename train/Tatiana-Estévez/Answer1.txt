  Your boyfriend sounds very supportive and he is correct  doing well on Quora means sometimes getting weird A2As and seeing some weird stuff. That doesn't make it OK though and we take this issue very seriously. We at Quora do totally appreciate how uncomfortable it can make users and we don't want users not contributing or leaving Quora because someone is creeping them out. 'Hitting on you'  'complimenting your lips'  asking if you had 'lip surgery' are things that I take a very dim view of. Frankly if I find out who this person is they'll be banned.
