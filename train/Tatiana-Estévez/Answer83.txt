Sometimes they might specify that they need more energy. I'd blend a few oils that I thought would work well for them  which would become the fragrance for the massage oil. The massage I did was normally just using basic Swedish massage techniques which I would customise depending on the type of treatment they had requested. So if they had requested a relaxing treatment I would increase the amount of Effleurage and Petrissage  For a more energising massage I'd increase the Tapotement and Friction in the massage.
