Quora takes this seriously and last year strengthened it's Be Nice  Be Respectful policy to include:We state explicitly that our Be Nice  Be Respectful policy applies to Messages on Quora.We have strengthened the Harassment clause  adding language that prohibits sexually explicit  profane  adversarial  or flirtatious language toward another person if such language would likely make the person uncomfortable.You can read more on Marc Bodnick's post here: A stronger Be Nice  Be Respectful policy: Messages are now fair game (and the Harassment clause is more explicit) by Marc Bodnick on The Quora Moderation BlogAny woman who gets a message like this should report these messages  which automatically blocks the user and is sent to us for action.
