People like this can give you a real ego boost. Ive never met someone that understands me the way you do  youre so insightful.Not taking responsibilityManipulators will frequently talk about life events of things that were done or happened to them. Bad things happen to everyone and many times theyre not our fault and were not responsible  but it is actually a healthy attitude to try and take responsibility in order to try and maintain some control. A manipulator is happy to relinquish this control.Taking exaggerated responsibilityA manipulator will go from not taking responsibility to taking an exaggerated responsibility that is so clearly and obviously not true.
