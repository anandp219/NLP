A company as large and as significant as LOreal will have a very large research and development budget in the same way Estee Lauder would have.It is easy to be seduced by some special ingredient like 'Crushed Unicorn Horn'  'Luxuriente FXC' or 'Biolore FN12'. OK I made them up  but then so do they. A large  global mid-priced-range company like Max Factor  has the buying power to put all the Luxuriente FXC it wants in its foundation. So for the most part  I do not believe the average person needs to spend more for cosmetics for their skin as than they can afford.
