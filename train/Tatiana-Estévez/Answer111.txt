Some people would compare perfume to wine  noting that expensive doesn't always mean better and isn't always recognisable as being pricier. There is some validity to this  but my impression of wine making is that a lot of the difference in expensive wines compared to cheaper wines  is due to the process of creating the product  whereas for fragrance a lot of the difference is due to the type of ingredients. Perhaps a more appropriate comparison to wine is that a good perfume may have the sophistication of a blended wine  compared to a single varietal.
