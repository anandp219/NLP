The better system has some way of releasing your desk if you dont use your desk by a certain period  so that someone else can use it. It means teams can book seats next to each other as well. My last company tells me the even have a phone app to book and cancel desks as well. In very large companies  where they have a relatively low ratio of desks to employees  they may also have a mix of these systems  where there is a booking in system  but there is also an area of unallocated desks that you can just sit in  whilst waiting for a desk to be allocated.Overall though  people do get used to this system  even though from the employee perspective it isnt ideal  it doesnt seem to cause any real issues.
