  For what it's worth  I grew up in the northern suburbs of St. Louis when it was still relatively crime-free and safe. We always locked the car  and we always locked doors and windows. It was just the prudent thing to do.However many of my friends grew up in more rural places in the state  and they still do not lock their cars... usually they're either at home  where they feel safe  or at work  where their cars are pretty safe in the office parking lot.Now I live in a much smaller city  but I still keep my old habit of keeing it locked wherever I am.
