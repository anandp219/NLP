I enjoy getting to work with powerful computers (and big screens) in a comfortable  white-collar office environment. I enjoy working with other communications professionals I respect and who respect me. I enjoy having flexibility in my hours  such that if I'm at the office till 2am some night  I can email in and tell my co-workers  "I'll be in around 10 tomorrow." I enjoy that I'm considered a professional  and I make a decent salarynot getting rich here  but it's not a bad living.And I take comfort in the fact that my talent and skills will never be obsolete.
