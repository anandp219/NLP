The Portable made no such compromises. It was a full-featured all-in-one desktop computer that folded up into a tidy little wedge with a handle  and it was all I needed for many years.The Portable continues to list on most compilations of Apple's most embarrassing missteps  but as an owner of one  I strenuously disagree. It was a beautiful computer with the best technology of its day.
