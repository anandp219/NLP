"Eugenia" is strongly homophonous with eugenics  which was an excerable (yet at the time  highly fashionable) intellectual assumption that the human race would be better served by breeding out undesirable races. The name Eugenia  to me  sounds like the name of a nation-state founded on this ugly principle. I would continue to investigate other names.
