  I'm not what you would call a "typography expert" but I do use type every day  and I'm very conscious of the use of typefaces and letterforms in design.That said  I believe Apple Watch typefaces are less about typography and more about usability. For a screen that size  an interface designer is going to be less concerned with the finer details of ligature  kerning  tracking  leading and type design then s/he will with functionality and readability. Typeface selection will have to be deliberate  of course  but simple letterforms will work better in such a small display than elaborate flourishes or exaggerated serifs.
