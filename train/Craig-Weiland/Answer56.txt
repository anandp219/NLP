I created a standards guide for it  that codifies all those things that keep a brand distinctive and uniform no matter how or where it's used. I designed livery for our fleet trucks  and massive graphics for our 52' van trailers. I designed a new template for our print advertising  which is seen all over the Midwest. I designed our Web site  which gets visitors from all over the world.This is enormously fulfilling to me. When I see my work out there in the world  representing my cooperative and hopefully improving its image and credibility among farmers and the people who support them  I feel uniquely proud.
