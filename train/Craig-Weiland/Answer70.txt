  Yes  there would be  so to make these two universes play together  the Terminator part of the equation would have to sacrifice its most defining elements. So you could put the two universes together  if you really wanted to  but this would be grossly unfair to the Terminator side of things. It would reduce the war of the Terminator films to be the mere preamble to the Matrix trilogy  with its most crucial elements disregarded. There's really no good reason to do this.For one thing  the Matrix backstory is well-established  and does not involve time-travel technology.
