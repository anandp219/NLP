  No one is "ad immune". While web advertising offers an immediate call to action (click here! )  this is only one of its purposes  a secondary purpose at best. Its primary purpose is to be seen and communicate its advertising message.As savvy Web users  our eyes are trained to ignore anything that looks like an advertisement on our Web pages. (Sometimes it's quite startling how blind people can be to user interface elements when they come too close to resembling ads.) But that doesn't mean we aren't exposed  or invulnerable to their influence.
