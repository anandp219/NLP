I'm willing to bet most apps will rely on sans-serif fonts  to display information as concisely as possible while maintaining legibility.That's not to say that simple faces designed for small screens are unsophisticated. Anything but. Many popular faces have entire variants expressly for use on small digital screens like phones  PDAs and single-function devices like MP3 players. These will be in high demand by those designing apps for the Apple Watch.But if you're designing an interface for an app which is about the consumption of words  chances are you're going to do it in very abbreviated form on the Apple Watch.
