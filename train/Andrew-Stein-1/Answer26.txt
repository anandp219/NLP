While the CGI was top notch and I'll enjoy anything that Amy Poehler  Bill Hader or Lewis Black does  the story was surprisingly simplistic and very predictable. There were also small details that bugged me. Why were the memories shown in 3rd person? Why did the emotions talk about Rylee as if she were a separate entity? Also  while I appreciate that this movie might get people to start thinking about how we think (introspection and metacognition)  I was somewhat dismayed that they chose to perpetuate the myth that memories are like movies that never change  as opposed to the fact that memories are constantly being reconstructed and prone to error.
