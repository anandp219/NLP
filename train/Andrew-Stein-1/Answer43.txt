  Earlier in the season  Pied Piper ran into funding issues when Peter Gregory died and Hooli sued them for intellectual property violations. Raviga pulled their funding and no other VCs wanted a part of Pied Piper with the pending lawsuit. At some point  they got a call from a company interested in investing in Pied Piper and asked for them to give a presentation. It turned out that company  Endframe  were just trying to trick the Pied Piper team into divulging technical details on his "middle-out" compression algorithm ("brain raping") Unfortunately  by the time they figured out they were just being used  Dinesh and Gilfoyle had given away enough information to allow Endframe to reverse-engineer the algorithm and build their own platform off of that.
