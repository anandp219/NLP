  I just watched it for the first time this weekend (May 17  2015.) I was pretty nervous going in as I heard it had over-the-top violence  which I generally don't enjoy. That being said  I loved it. It was an amazingly filmed scene  from choreography  editing  music choice  etc. I saw many comments and reviews calling it over the top  jaw dropping  disgusting  too violent  etc. The actual depiction of violence itself could barely quality to even be cartoonish. Someone actually made an infographic of Harry's kills in that scene[1]:Despite killing 40 people in less than 3.5 minutes  there's almost no blood or gore  no suffering  and almost everyone dies instantly.
