Our brains aren't wired like that. However  a little humility and knowledge can help. In fact  one of the most useful things one can do is to find good  trusted devil's advocates. Run your ideas and decisions by people (who are knowledgeable about the subject) who aren't afraid to tell you why you are wrong. One of the worst things you can do when it comes to critical thinking is to surround yourself with sycophants who never tell you when you are making a horrible decision. If you ever become rich and famous  make sure at least one person in your entourage isn't afraid to call you out when you are about to do something that'll ruin your career.
