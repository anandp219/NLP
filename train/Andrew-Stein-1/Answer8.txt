  Gavin Belson  was personally insulted when Richard didn't sell Pied Piper's technology to Hooli early in the series. He sued Pied Piper for theft of intellectual property  hoping to seize their IP through legal means. Belson knew the lawsuit was based on shaky grounds  so one tactic they cooked up was to make the mediator think that Bighead was the actual brains behind Pied Piper. Belson figured if he kept promoting Big Head  it would be evidence that Pied Piper's algorithm came from Bighead and not Richard.
