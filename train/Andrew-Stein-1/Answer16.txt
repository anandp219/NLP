The Jack Woltz plot line  especially in the novel  is used to demonstrate Vito's power compared to Jacks. Woltz talks about how he advised the White House on WW2 propaganda and had a personal relationship with J. Edgar Hoover. He was very showy  very public and very famous (most people only knew Vito as an olive oil businessman  if they even heard of him.) He was a person who was secure in his personal  professional and political power. Finding his horse's head in his bed was shocking to him  not only because of the violation of his home and property  but because Vito was sending a very clear message: Jack Woltz' connections weren't nearly as powerful as Vito's.With that in mind  Vito felt it was too much of a risk to deal in hard drugs like heroin.
