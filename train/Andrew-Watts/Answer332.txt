What is more fascinating still is that Xenakis preliminary sketch for Metastaseis was in graphic notation  again baring certain similarities to Pendereckis aleatoric notation with Threnody  showing graphs of mass motion and glissandi like structural beams of the piece  with pitch on one axis and time on the other. Yet unlike Penderecki who took his aleatoric representation as the completed score  Xenakis then rewrote every event in traditional notation for the published score.Perhaps more importantly  what separates each of these composers techniques is the means of achieving the dense  individually moving divisi lines.
