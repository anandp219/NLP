After some time Lachenmann said that the music he would bring in was entirely void of typical melodies  and yet Nono would find a particular use of a half-step interval to be too bourgeoisie. The way that Lachenmann told this story during his 2015 lecture in Pavia made apparent this experience with Nono was traumatic  and at the same time far reaching in influence. In an attempt to invent what music could be through "emptying" what he already knows (Lachenmann  2008)  he found a new expressivity  a new beauty  which he problematizes in his essay The Beautiful in Music Today:Except for Luigi Nono  leading composers of yesterday have exhausted their resources  They are celebrating the comeback of the bourgeois concept of beauty  a form sickening to anyone who sees in art  or in beauty  more than just a masquerade (Lachenmann  1980  p. 21).This new approach to expressivity was initially inspired by serialism  first of the Second Viennese School composers (Arnold Schoenberg  Alban Berg  Anton Webern)  then the dominant postwar figures of the time (Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen).
