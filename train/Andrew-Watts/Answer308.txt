Put their recommendations through the who  what  when  where  and how. As for modern composers  it is a bit difficult to recommend without knowing more about someone's preferences. Like before  there are thousands of living composers writing in many different (sometimes opposing) styles. My advice is to listen to a wide variety of major figures with different aesthetics. Right away follow up on the ones you connect with  but also be sure to return to those you didn't. Musical taste is not set in stone  and yours will surely shift over time.
