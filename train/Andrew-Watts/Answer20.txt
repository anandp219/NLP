Ewart recorded the album Homage to Charles Parker in 1979 with Lewis. Though it is unclear if and how the music of Charlie Parker shaped Lewis' conception of Voyager  it is likely that Parker's idiosyncrasies as a player influenced Lewis' practice  phrasing  and pacing on the trombone. This long-time involvement with the AACM makes up one of Lewis' core identities as a musician  and in May of 2008 Lewis published a book about the organization through the University of Chicago Press entitled A Power Stronger Than Itself: The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians.The avant garde jazz aesthetic throughout much of the AACM concerts could have further informed versions of Voyager.
