Xenakis achieves his sound-cloud textures through mathematical structures and probabilities  taking data derived from such equations to determine starting and ending pitches/attack times/durations  then transcribing them to music paper. Ligeti was heavily influenced by the massive polyphonic canons in the music of early choral composers like Johannes Ockeghem  and thus  applied such ideas to a dodecaphonic pitch language. Penderecki produced his extensive elaborations on tone clusters by aleatoric means  often involving a multitude of glissandi effects with indeterminate repetitions of attacks and entrances.
