Nono has assigned Dallapiccolas motive of hope to tuned metal sheets in a number of works as late as Con Luigi Dallapiccola (1979) for six percussionists and live electronics. Durazzi follows this motivic relationship chronologically back through to the beginning of the final movement of Canti di vita e d'amore  stating: [After] the strong promise of a brighter future  the first sound in the orchestra is a twelve-note cluster played by bells. The predominance of bells and cymbals emphasizes the new-found sense of hope in the final movement and thus emphasizes the global progression of themes in the work.In Canti di vita e damore the Second Viennese School influence is seen most prominently via the rigorous organization of materials  especially pitches (as described in the discrete choirs quotation).
