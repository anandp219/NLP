For Mortuos Plango  Vivos Voco  Harvey's son  a chorister  is heard throughout the work. During the first section the sung text  taken from the Latin inscription from the Winchester tenor bell  is clearly intelligible with the only obstruction toward easy comprehension being the non-native aspect of the Latin language. As the work progresses  Harvey transitions between the various transpositions of the real recorded singing and the synthesized  fake vocal line. The gradual approach of the fake from the real creates moments within gestures of immense ambiguity.
