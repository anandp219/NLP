  [Image via The Sound of Struggle Tempered With Terror: Penderecki At 80]Krzysztof Pendereckis Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima (1960) was written for 52 string instruments and is notable for the use of extended instrumental techniques (playing behind the bridge  bowing on the tailpiece  etc.) and textures consisting of tone clusters. The extended techniques employed throughout Threnody were not novel on an individual basis. However  their application to an entire string orchestra  and paired with unconventional notation made the results unique for the time.
