In C is distant to both aesthetics and takes an ideological stance of openness to achieve inclusion and expressive freedom  rather than the total Cageian freedom where human expression is often seen to interfere with how the experiment should naturally play out. Perhaps the most important influence on Riley when creating In C was the 1960s counter-cultural zeitgeist taking place in California. In C was written at the onset of this. However  there were precursors establishing the West Coast as a bastion of anti-Euro-centric thought and the anti-overly systemic institutionalization of composition.
