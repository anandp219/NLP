  I hate to be the bearer of bad news  but there are simply not that many schools in the United States that guarantee full funding to all admitted composition students for stand-alone master's programs. Furthermore  those that do cover all expenses are certainly not overlooked by prospective applicants. For example  Yale School of Music and the Curtis Institute of Music generally post acceptance rates well below 10 percent. Wesleyan University also has a fully funded MA in composition. Their music department continues a phenomenal legacy of experimental music which has included esteemed faculty like Anthony Braxton and Alvin Lucier.
