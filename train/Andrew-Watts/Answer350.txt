The inclusion of palindromes and number sequences to generate rhythms and durations  though seen in passages of Bartok  point to an influence of Messiaen as well  who has written extensively on the use of these compositional techniques.Canti di vita e d'amore also signals an important major departure from the typical serial techniques for Nono. Durazzi cites a verbal note from Nono stating that this work would no longer use complete serial series  but instead would be composed of campi sonori (sounding fields) or fascie sonori (sounding bands) built upon collections of a few basic intervals.
