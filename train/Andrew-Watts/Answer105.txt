Lastly  I have known a few composers who are extremely adept with technology that have completed fully funded multi-disciplinary master's degrees. The two to check out for this sort of path are Dartmouth College's Digital Musics Program and the MIT Media Lab.If you are determined to study music composition at the graduate level then please do not let these limited options dissuade you. There are a number of other factors to consider and possible outcomes. Other institutions do give select scholarships  they are just not guaranteed for all admitted students.
