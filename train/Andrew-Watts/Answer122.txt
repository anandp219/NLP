In performance the prompter is bombarded by various cues from the ensemble  with each musician trying to get the prompter to display the symbol he or she wants to initiate the next event. And while it is impossible for the prompter to be completely impartial  it is largely for the musicians to decide which type of cue will provide the most interesting continuation of events.For example  one musician might hold one hand over his mouth while displaying four fingers with the other hand  meaning that he wants the sub crossfade event to take place.
