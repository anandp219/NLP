Lastly  it appears that the work was premiered by The Collegium Musicum  an ensemble conducted by Bach and based in a storied Zimmermans coffee house in Leipzig  Germany. The libretto was written by Christian Friedrich Henrici  known as Picander  and features lines like-- "If I couldn't  three times a day  be allowed to drink my little cup of coffee  in my anguish I will turn into a shriveled-up roast goat".
