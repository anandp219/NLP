Nevertheless  the same principles will be examined; focusing on the sections where the instrumental tone is overloaded and unstable  simultaneously containing many different timbres or rapidly shifting between timbres. Most often this is realized in heavy distortion and  in the case of acoustic instruments  extreme pressure applied to a gesture to effectively distort the tone.Pression (1969)  Helmut LachenmannGiven the above definition  I am reluctant to believe that any of Pression qualifies as true timbral saturation.
