  W.A. MozartBy Hermann Abert; translated by Stewart Spencer; edited by Cliff EisenDuring my sophomore year in college I took an honors class entitled "Mozart and His Era." The required reading before each lecture was always from Abert's W.A. Mozart  a massive tome clocking in at 1 544 pages. Stephen Pritchard of the Guardian calls this a "a million-word monument" and after finishing it over the span of the semester I attest that it is thorough in a way unlike any other biography I have encountered.
