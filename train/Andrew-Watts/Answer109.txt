It 	is considered strictly indeterminate music if the composer 	relinquished creative control to a process of composition  though 	still fully notating the results  and the performer is not given any 	special indication regarding interpretation. The 	Oxford Companion to Music's 	indeterminate music entry focuses on techniques used by John 	Cage  such as determining compositional choices by tossing coins  or 	by placing notes on physical imperfections in the manuscript paper  	by tracing musical patterns from star maps  and so on.
