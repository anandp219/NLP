Furthermore  there is no conductorthe initiation of events is brought about by the ensemble members themselves via the prompter who stands facing the ensemble (back to the audience) with the cue cards on a table in front of him; the ensemble is arranged in a semicircle facing the audience  the prompter and each other.
