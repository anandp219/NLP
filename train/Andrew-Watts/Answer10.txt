Harvey deviates from this practice by the degree of compressing  excerpting  and otherwise mutilating the original recording of the sung passage. Composers of early church music certainly employed similar techniques of augmentation  diminution  inversion  and retrograde to make the most out of their materials  but this was always within the realm of human performance. By removing the restriction of human performance Harvey is able do away with the standard division keeping single sounds from becoming both individual small-scale events and multiple large-scale formal markers.
