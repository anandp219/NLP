I remember a fascinating lecture by Tristan Murail in Darmstadt: the orchestral work which was subsequently performed was markedly different from what I had expected on the strength of the lecture. I realized much later that the pieces which correspond to what I had expected from Murail would need to be composed by myself. Regarding Partch  Tenney  and Young  their use of the harmonies that deviate from the conventional tempered scale influenced Haas immensely. He was particularly interested in the twelfth-tones and even smaller intervals up to the quarter-tone when conceiving the six piano turnings in Limited Approximation.
