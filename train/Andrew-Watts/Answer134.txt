  Curtis Lindsay hit the nail on the head  piano transcriptions of orchestral music used to be the norm. Composers would often write a piano short score or piano four-hands before orchestrating the work. For example  you will find a number of piano versions for Rachmaninoff's symphonic pieces. My favorite happens to be the composer's final work  Op. 45 Symphonic Dances.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Similarly  solo piano  piano four-hands  and various orchestrations exist for Brahms' most famous works (notably the Hungarian Dances).
