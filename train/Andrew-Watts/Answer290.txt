During the points of overpressure with the bow  the pitch content is not drown out by noise. Furthermore  there is a stability and consistency within the technique of overpressure. For every instance the same ratio of string pitch and scratch tone sound is achieved. There are sections highlighting a greater level of sonic ambiguity  however these (again) do not aim to encompass many different timbres concurrently or rapidly shift between timbres per gesture. Pression is a tour de force regarding all sorts of sounds possible on the instrument  though each timbre is approached in a manner to create a discrete  repeatable identity instead of a combine  opaque resultant.
