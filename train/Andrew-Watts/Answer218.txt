The lack of temporal precision inherent in the time-line notation  coupled with the indeterminate pitch (as high as possible) creates performed complexity far exceeding what can be seen on the page. Perhaps the best way to contextualize the differences in compositional approach is top down (Penderecki) vs. bottom up (Ligeti). Penderecki deconstructs what is required to create sound masses. In the case of Threnody  these textures could be arrived at from painstakingly notated individual parts  but in the end his practice begs the question: What is the point of nuanced individual lines when (as Ligeti points out) the particularities of the polyphonic structure become inaudible?
