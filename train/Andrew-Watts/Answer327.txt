Harvey clearly presents both his sound sources in their raw  highly recognizable form  but over the course of the piece gradually abstracts them by moving along a real vs. synthesized continuum.Lastly  there is the lineage of tape music leading up to Mortuos plango. After earning a PhD at Cambridge Harvey studied with Milton Babbitt at Princeton University on a Harkness Fellowship. While there  in addition to the works of Babbitt  Otto Luening  and Vladimir Ussachevsky using the Columbia-Princeton Studios  he would have been aware of the electro-acoustic compositions of Karlheinz Stockhausen.
