As I progressed in my craft my interest in more technical publications began to take over my reading list  both out of necessity and a pure love for the material. These included The Collected Essays of Milton Babbitt  Olivier Messiaen's The Technique of my Musical Language  and Erno Lendvai's Bela Bartok: An Analysis of His Music.During my final year in undergrad I received a commission to write an art song for a music festival. I took this as an opportunity to delve deeper into modern poetry. I felt strongly about using text from a contemporary writer  as I would hope those in other art forms would feel strongly about using music from a contemporary composer.
