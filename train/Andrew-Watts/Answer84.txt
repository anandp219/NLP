So then  if musicians are performing this piece in concerts it must be musical  right? The issue becomes whether it is inherently musical or whether it is translated into music by the performers. Here lies a philosophical debate that extends far beyond this specific instance  and concerns any instruction based art form. Does the essence of the art exist only when being performed? This is a non-issue for improvisational forms of expression  and yet ironically the highly indeterminate score for Ursonate firmly places it in a no-man's land of mediums.
