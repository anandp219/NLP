Through re-recording the playback of the speech within the same space again and again the voice looses it's identifying articulations and becomes a featureless contour by the nth iteration. Though the audibility of the text as such is lost at this point  the process is dependent on repetition  and thus it is understood that the same text is being stated (re-stated) in the same space. This is not to say that there meaning is unwavering. Striping the audibility of the text over the course a performance carries implications of death  loss  voicelessness  and so forth.
