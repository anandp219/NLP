Nevertheless  one can surely speculate about possible influences given knowledge of the time  place  and musical culture.Ockeghem is grouped with the Franco-Flemish School of composers. These include the first generation (1420-1450) figures like Guillaume Dufay  Gilles Binchois  and Antoine Busnois; and the second generation" (1450-1485) contemporaries of Ockeghem including Orto  Compere  Prioris  Agricola  Caron  Faugues  Regis  and Tinctorus. Biographer Leeman L. Perkins states that while Ockeghem may have begun his musical life as a choirboy training in Saint Ghislain  it is more probable he received most of his early education in the nearby Mons.
