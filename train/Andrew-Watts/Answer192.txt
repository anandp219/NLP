10:00PM I have come up with a plan of attack and am implementing this. Generally  it is unclear at first whether or not a given solution will work. Sadly  this means I have to compose a great deal of music before I can determine if it is a successful fix or if I need another approach. 12:00AM - 02:00AM (depending on the day) I am running solely on craft and inertia  trying to fulfill as much of the latest idea as possible while still making sense. Writing short notes about where this will continue the next day is commonplace  along with skeletal sketches.
