The timbral saturation is not achieved with the same sense of spontaneity or fluidity seen in the Hendrix  as Hendrix's performance was likely drawing from equal parts prior performances and novel improvisation. Trash TV Trance is fully notated  and though some interpretation is necessary for all written music  soloists for Romitelli's piece stick closely to the nuanced indications in order to accurately reproduce the intended effects. Some of these effects (touching the live 1/4 jack from the instrument cable to the metal guitar bridge  scraping the plectrum against the low E and A strings in a circular motion  etc) generate timbral saturation  though they are employed as discrete sounds  each with a repeatable identity.
