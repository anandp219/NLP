Though the similarities between each of the Goldberg Variations are palpable  notably the inescapable G Major and ground bass blueprint  the drama is attained by abrupt stylistic shifts. Far from subtle  this path would be more appropriated simplified as point A to B to C to D  to A' (the Quodlibet)  then all the sudden back to A for the aria da capo.In lieu of genre pieces breaking up the succession of canons  Abrahamsen uses intermezzi. These periods function as drawn out reliefs from the otherwise relentless ostinati  but also serve the practical function of allowing the players to re-tune their instruments microtonally without completely stopping the motion of the piece.
