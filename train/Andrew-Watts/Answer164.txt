Reich maintains a similar approach to Lucier's I am sitting in a room with regards to creative intervention within the processes of Come Out. A concept is established and once the materials are properly set up the piece plays out with little intervention or decision making by the composer. Indeterminate parameters seen in I am sitting in a room are  however  replaced in Come Out with carefully chosen concrete instructions and treatments. The text is not only a required selection by Reich but also the specific excerpts which are then used as samples ad nauseam.
