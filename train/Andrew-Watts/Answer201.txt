The key composers defining the musical scene in the early 1960s included figures like Elliott Carter  Luciano Berio  and Karlheinz Stockhausen. In the book Terry Riley's in C author Robert Carl emphasizes that the composition community of that era valued those who "pushed limits of fixed-score complexity  [regarding this] as the standard for 'advanced' composition." In the other direction was the unwavering experimentalism of John Cage who  as Carl notes  "had moved music into realms of noise and randomized activity that created often chaotic results."
