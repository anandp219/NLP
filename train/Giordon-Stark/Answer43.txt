What is worth the effort is using PyROOT instead  or the Athena C++ libraries (and frameworks) meant to interface with the ROOT data. ROOT6 is coming  and perhaps that will be much better  but only time will tell. It might a better investment of your time to learn Python or C++ (C++11 is awesome) as packages like SpartyJet or FastJet are built purely for specific kinds of optimizations and centrality.Apart from that  the header files of ROOT are not that bad to follow  and the online documentation  while shitty  at least has a pretty good listing of all possible functions: ROOT Reference Guide.
