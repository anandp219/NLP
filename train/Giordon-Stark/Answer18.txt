Could anyone who worked on selectors double check he/she updated to the new type convention?I can check this.That would be awesome  thanks!As you can see  the original email is the one most nested in and my responses are bolded  and you can see Marco's responses to my responses  and you can read the full conversation from each block. This is a fantastic feature that Google has always supported. It's a wonderful habit and it allows me to really focus on key items of the email without having to scroll up and down to read old replies and so forth.
