The red circles (Central Trigger Processor  CTP) can open up the pipes to the next level (from level 1 to level 2  and from level 2 to the magnetic tapes at Tier-0 for recording). The goal is to trigger on events that we consider interesting  but trigger fast enough that we don't have a backlog. Level 1 is basically our first line of defense. One of my research projects is in hardware development for this level for Run 3 (2018+). So Level 1 is incredibly crude and incredibly fast. It has multiple components that analyze various parts of the event in parallel (via data multiplexing).
