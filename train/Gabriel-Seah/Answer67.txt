(The cost of illiteracy in China)Pinyin.info looks at a 1996 study which actually tested a national probability sample  and a high estimate of the literacy rate was about 76% (as opposed to the official figures of 85%) (Chinese literacy). Once one weights this for population and the ability to write (which is  after all  half the definition of literacy) it is evident that the official literacy rate in China is misleadingly high.This being China  there is also concern that officials are inflating the figures.
