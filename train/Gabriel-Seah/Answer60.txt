To rejoice about feminist victories these days counts as betrayal. (Feminists  Accept It. The Patriarchy Is Dead. )Activists are reluctant to acknowledge that things are good because they lose their raison d'tre  funding  political capital  the power of victimhood (Psychology of Victimhood  Don't Blame the Victim  Article by Ofer Zur  Ph.D.) and/or a sense of righteousness  which can be intoxicating.That said  from what I've seen of MRAs they don't seem to be saying that despite the effective end of the draft things are going from bad to worse  but that the draft aside things aren't very good (and are possibly getting worse).
