most of them) pass the job over to tuition.Ironically  this is probably partly due to the "Teach Less  Learn More" and similar policies. Whereas in the past there was an emphasis on rote learning  the reduced emphasis on it means now other ways must be found of assessing students.Normally this would lead to less stress  but because students (and parents) want to ace the modified exams  they go to private education to learn techniques to ace them that don't just rely on memorisation.A Way Out?This is the bit where I say something clever and/or optimistic to make you feel good.Unfortunately  the problem is so entrenched that I can't see a way out.Even our eminent Ministers don't see a way out  with former Education Minister Ng Eng Hen proclaiming that "We're not as bad as the Koreans" and "It's innate in our Asian culture" (Tuition culture here not as bad as elsewhere  Hansard: Page on parl.gov.sg)  in response to concerns about tuition culture.So between the system existing as it is  Confucian culture  kiasuism and a national ideology of meritocracy (where school grades are seen as a measure of merit and worth  and are currency that entitles one to a good life)  there isn't any way out except to not have children  to have children overseas or to have children but be contented that they may not be the human resources that Singapore wants them to be (in other words  they may fail at the socially-important metrics like grades in school  but you can look at broader measures of success).
