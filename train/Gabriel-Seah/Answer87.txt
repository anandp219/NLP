So people were upset at those seeking to maintain the purity of the sport (such as it is) more than Armstrong  who broke the rules.In other words  what upsets people isn't really that hunters are unsporting.And even if it were unsporting how would that make it "irresponsible"?Is anybody being hurt by killing for sport?
