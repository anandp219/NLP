Miss L's son was one of the two that didn't.The teacher said she couldn't hold 28 kids back for the sake of two.Miss L promptly bundled her son off to an intensive Hanyu Pinyin class that cramped 6 months' worth of curriculum into 8 sessions.The best part  my old classmates and I learnt  was that this took place not in an elite school  but in a neighbourhood school  somewhere in Tampines.For context  students in Primary One are aged 7 years old. So in the year of their entry into formal schooling  93% of a class in a neighbourhood school (a colloquial term for not-so-good schools) were going for Mandarin tuition.This outsourcing of work to tuition agencies is also because of the "Teach Less  Learn More" policy (meant to reduce pressure on students  reduce rote learning and explore more innovative ways of learning).
