As it is with GDP growth  so it is for literacy statistics.China's poverty and large rural population surely have something to do with its illiteracy rate  but the written language definitely plays a part as well. It is instructive that many languages (e.g. Vietnamese  Korean) used to be written with Chinese characters  but transitioned to other scripts  partly to promote literacy (Vietnamese Writing System  History of Hangul Part I).It is also revealing that in China and Japan  young people are losing their ability to write Chinese characters without help (from their computers or phones) and thus are essentially illiterate (When Chinese children forget how to write - BBC News  Wired youth forget how to write in China and Japan).
