  It depends.As Scott Lowe points out  delisting a site is the main sanction UNESCO can visit upon a country (with the attendant negative publicity and loss of prestige  tourism money and restoration assistance).UNESCO has  of the writing of this post  delisted only 2 World Heritage Sites:Dresden Elbe ValleyArabian Oryx SanctuaryDresden was struck off the list due to the building of the Waldschlsschen Bridge  which "meant that the property failed to keep its "outstanding universal value as inscribed"" (Dresden is deleted from UNESCOs World Heritage List).Meanwhile  the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was deleted from the list because Oman reduced its size by 90% (Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary : first site ever to be deleted from UNESCO's World Heritage List).Basically  UNESCO World Heritage sites should not be substantially affected  such that the criteria under which they were inscribed are affected.
