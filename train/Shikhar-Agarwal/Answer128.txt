I am a firm believer in the policies "be the change"  "start small" and so on  but when these happen just for the cultural festivals and celebrations  then it feels as if someone is constantly shouting "Don't eat  don't eat!" for every bite I take of my favorite food. This is same as people suddenly realizing that India is suffering from poverty and saying  "That money could have been used to reduce poverty instead of wasting on the Mars mission Mangalyaan". "Green Diwali" means eco-friendly Diwali  not firecrackers-less Diwali.
