It is believed that they battled for 9 days  and on the 10th day  Durga killed Mahishasura. Therefore the 10th day is called Vijayadashmi  day of the victory. One of the most famous idols that you see in temples depicts this scene where Mahishasura  in the form of a half bull  is being slayed by Mother Durga.
