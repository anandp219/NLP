  In Hinduism  importance is given to one's action  karma  dharma and it's impact rather than on one's identity. The Trinity - Brahma  Vishnu and Shiva are considered to be superior than the Devas like Indra  because the former have much bigger roles. In Shaktism  Shakti is considered to be superior than the Trinity because she is the energy of all. Thus  these hierarchies are formed due to their responsibilities and actions - dharma and karma.For Rukhmini's case  our mythology has only talked about her identity - she being incarnation of Laxmi  it has never highlighted any of her achievements - and for a reason - unlike the births of Sita and Ram whose objectives  besides establishing dharma  were to set examples of ideal wife  husband  mother  ruler and so on  Krishna's role was to set examples of ideal lover  devotee  friend  guide  guru and to give mankind the lotus-like words of Gita  and Ruhkmini's role was to be his human-consort.
