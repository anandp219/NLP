  A disciple asks Buddha  "Guruji  there are many people who constantly argue about various beliefs  some say world is infinite or soul is eternal  others says it doesn't exist and so on. I am very confused by these. "Buddha  replies "Once a king assembled several blind men in a room and told them  'Here is an elephant'. He then gave them a model of different parts of an elephant like his head  tusk  tail  ear and foot. After a couple of minutes  he asks them  'What sort of thing is an elephant?'
