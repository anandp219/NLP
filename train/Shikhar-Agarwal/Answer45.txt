  I am sure you have heard several stories about students leaving CS in non-IIT institutes to join any department in IIT. You might have heard your mother telling you how smart Sharma uncle's son is just because he is an IITian. You might also have seen many students showing off their IIT T-shirts. So yes  students  in fact the society in general  see IIT as a brand. But let's say in future  some college Indian Institute of Better Technology (IIBT) is established that is better than IITs  would you still be that crazy about IITs?
