Swami repeated again and again  becoming more stern each time. The king was growing angry and the assistant started trembling. Finally  he cried out  "How can I spit on this? This picture is of our beloved and respected king! ".Swamiji then told him  "The king is sitting in front of you in person. This picture is merely a paper - it does not speak  hear  think or move. But still you did not spit because you see a shadow of your king in it  Spitting on it was like spitting on the king itself." The king looked at Swamiji and bowed down  clearly understanding what he was referring to.This is the essence of idol worshiping.
