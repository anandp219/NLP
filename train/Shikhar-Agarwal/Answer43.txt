In Hinduism  every living being is equal and God resides in all. Therefore  we worship our parents  teachers  plants and animals. From childhood  we see inequality  and hence this complexity  otherwise it is simply universality.Freedom and Easy to misuse: With great freedom comes great responsibility  but many people don't realize this. So they misuse Hinduism's open-endedness to modify or frame policies to benefit a certain section of people. This has added a lot of noise over time like superstitions  dowry  caste system  self-made babas  etc which demotivates people to study about the real greatness.For a beginner  "light" would seem to be a mystery - it's a wave  particle  colored  visible  invisible and so on.
