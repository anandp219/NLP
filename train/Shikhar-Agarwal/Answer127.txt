The issue doesn't end here. These people would spend 1000s of dollars to see 4th of July fireworks in the US  or similar things at other events and places.But suddenly the eco-friendly person in them wakes up by the name of Diwali. Diwali becomes the one-step solution to all the environmental problems. People conveniently pass all their anti-environmental misdeeds to it thinking that they would become free from all the blame. It's like doing continuous sins hoping that a bath in Ganga would wash all these away  or actively participating in everyday corruption and transferring all the blame to the government citing various scams.My problem is not by "don't burn crackers" slogans but by these people and the fact that the eco-friendly person in them rises for just one day and then becomes dormant.
