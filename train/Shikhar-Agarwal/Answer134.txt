One has to understand that this does not imply that she was inferior - it's just that they incarnated for some specific reasons.Now to set an example of an ideal lover and a devotee  one needs other side of the coin too  and here comes Radha  an epitome of selfless love  the love which knew no boundaries  no age  no community. It is this devotion which pulled Krishna to play his beautiful flute  and it is the same devotion which drove Radha to the Raas Leela  forgetting her own self. This love  this devotion  this karma  pure as a prayer  a silent meditation  is what makes Radha divine  this is what turns a devotee into God.
