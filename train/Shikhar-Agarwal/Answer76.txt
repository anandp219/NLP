  In 1883  a German immigrant named John Roeblig was inspired to build a spectacular bridge to connect New York with Long Island. As is the case with most of the greatest of ideas  experts in this area mocked him for dreaming about the impossible. But like most of the greatest visionaries  he was not the kind of the person who would be disheartened by the mortals of the time. He successfully convinced his son Washington about the idea and the duo started working on the plan.Few months into the project  there was a tragic accident on site and John lost his life.
