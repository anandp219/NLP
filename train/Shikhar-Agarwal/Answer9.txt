O son of PRth  there is no work prescribed for Me within all the three planetary systems. Nor am I in want of anything  nor have I a need to obtain anything  and yet I am engaged in prescribed duties. For if I ever failed to engage in carefully performing prescribed duties  O Prtha  certainly all men would follow My path. If I did not perform prescribed duties  all these worlds would be put to ruination  thereby destroying the peace of all living beings. As the ignorant perform their duties with attachment to results  the learned may similarly act  but without attachment  for the sake of leading people on the right path.
