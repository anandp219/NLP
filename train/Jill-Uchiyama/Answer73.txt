  If you think about it  it is not necessary to love oneself in order to be in love. Many people claim to be in love if you consider how many things this means. We do not have to love ourselves in order to feel the desire to be rescued from loneliness  for example. We do not have respect ourselves in order to experience sexual attraction. We do not have to treat ourselves well in order dream about a perfect world with another.But if you asked the question  "Is it possible for us to fully partner  care for  love  and commit to another human being if one does not love oneself " my answer would be  "no.
