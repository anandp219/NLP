  I don't think it's normal to be oriented only toward suffering or pain as a goal  and yet  I agree that suffering is a necessary part of life in order to grow and evolve.Evolution takes struggle  it does not come without some form of pain  whether it be stretching to move forward  working hard  or picking oneself up after a personal devastation.Happiness serves a purpose too. It is just as important as suffering. Where suffering is the temperature gauge that tells you when something is really off about a situation  people  or attitude in oneself- happiness is the full tank of gas that allows for life to flow lovingly along.
