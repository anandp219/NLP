If you want to live freely and help people around the world  great  but don't deny the practical aspects of needing to build something for yourself on the material plane.Money  while it is not everything  is something. If you spend all of your money and time as a young person and do not put anything away for yourself  you will need to catch up like hell when you get to be my age. That is what I'm doing now  and it's definitely put a kink in my "live and let live" lifestyle. I do not regret any of the decisions I made and the ways I spent my time and money as young adult.
