  It's possible that it is just a bunch of people jumping on another bandwagon  or it could be a collective cry from people who witnessed some excruciatingly hateful behavior on the part of our human race. Maybe there are just hoards of us that are really sorry about this. It's not just about a lion. It's a loaded event. It's white privilege in the form of a U.S. dentist who goes to another continent to live out his dream of slaying a lion. It's about the indecency and brutality of the human who cares more about his own ego than about what is true  beautiful  and awe-inspiring.It is about the anguish in hearing how an innocent animal was coerced by such an evil intention  and how the human brain manipulated an animal in his own habitat for the purpose of hunting it down and killing it.It is about the inhumanity of those who participated in injuring Cecil and then finally killing him  burning him  decapitating him... is this enough?
