  I had the experience of being an American working abroad in London and Tokyo- totally different times  and different jobs. Here are my own notable comparisons:Both Londoners and Tokyoites are shy  reserved people. Neither make eye contact on trains very often.London offers Beatles walking tours. Tokyo has the John Lennon museum.Both cities drive in the right side of the car and on the left side of the road.In London  my English was frowned upon. In Tokyo  my English was valued and cherished. In both cities  I worked with English speaking people from all over the world- Australians  Canadians  New Zealanders  Irish  British  Indians  and other Americans.
