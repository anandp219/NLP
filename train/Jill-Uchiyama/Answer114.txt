In Tokyo  men piss on the street. In London  people piss off.In London  it was common to drink after work. In Tokyo  drinking is expected during work. The weirdest thing that happened to me in Tokyo was being groped on a crowded train. In London  it was a bomb threat- next door to my office building. Either way  I was nearly screwed.Both London and Tokyo can feel like enormous  overwhelmingly lonely places. London has cathedrals  and Tokyo has temples and shrines. Neither are particularly religious places.But the best part for a lonely American working abroad in either London or Tokyo... both have Hard Rock Cafes which serve Thanksgiving dinner every year.
