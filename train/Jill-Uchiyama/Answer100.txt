  Yes. I did although my mother and I aren't even biologically related (I'm adopted).I was so excited about my results from 23andMe that as I shared them with my mother  she began to get excited too. Specifically  she was interested in the ancestry part and had wondered if the family rumor that one of her grandmothers had Native American blood was true or not. When I shared with her about all of the biological cousins I was finding  she was also intrigued. Now  my mother is not computer literate  so she gave me full permission to take care of her account.
