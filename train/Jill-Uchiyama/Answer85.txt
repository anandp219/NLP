It's nice  but it's not enough. It's about being special simply because you are alive. Because you are a human being. In this way  I can say that yes  I am special- and as a human being  so are you. You are actually the most important person in the world. You have to be because if you do not believe that  you will not be in the driver's seat of your own life  which means you will always allow others and outside situations to define you "as less than." You must believe you are the most important person because if you don't  you will not be taking your life seriously- for all the right reasons.
