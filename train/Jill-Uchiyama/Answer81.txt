Particularly the creamy ones.9. Western style sushi is totally off and not the same as Japanese sushi. We don't get the rice right.10. The flavors we choose for potato chips are completely different than what Japanese choose. For example  salt and vinegar versus soy sauce and butter flavor. 11. American chocolate is too sweet.
