Even if we are full of unconscious holes  or conditioning  or have had pain inflicted upon us  we must have some basis for knowing what loving behavior is and therefore  have some kind of connection to it. So many people seem to have that foundation but have not yet learned how to fully love themselves throughout all circumstances  and so there are gaps in what we value and how we react and behave.So on one hand  we must have that core in order to be fully loving  and on the other  rarely does an individual have a complete sense of self-love - in the healthiest and highest sense of the word.
