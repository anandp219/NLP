You may want to give up on yourself  your talents  and the subjects that you were once interested in. A bad teacher rips you off  tears down your enthusiasm  and cuts off your oxygen like a paper bag over your head. A bad teacher stays with you for life. Yes  he/she can ruin your openness and passion for a subject permanently.
