You do not wake up in the middle of the night sweating over causing another person's pain. You do not feel that knot in your stomach because you were a jerk yesterday and hurt your mother  or your brother  or you friends  or your lover. You get to feel relaxed around your very own instincts over time  because you begin to trust your own deepest motives. You know that if anyone in your life dies today  your last interaction with them was clean  loving  and kind. You know that if you die today  that all of your interactions are exactly what you wanted them to be.
