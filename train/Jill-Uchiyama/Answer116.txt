  Perhaps it will be the book that you end up writing.Cheryl Strayed wrote her memoirs while hiking 1000 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail in California. She certainly had her problems including drug addiction  grief over losing her mother  and marital problems. Her decision to walk across California came from a deep need to change her life- to find out what is on the other side  beyond her limits. It's an amazing story  and we all have one. Some are kept in the privacy of our own memories  or between lovers.
