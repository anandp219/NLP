At the time  I was in so much shock I could barely work. And I had just moved to a new state after living in Japan for 5 years  so I was alone there  scrambling to figure out what new direction my life could possibly take.My mother leapt at the chance to come and visit me. She was afraid of flying so she rode 15 hours on a Greyhound bus through several states to stay with me for a few days. Although her visit was somewhat of a blur  as she was leaving to go back home on the bus  I had a moment of clarity that I will never forget.
