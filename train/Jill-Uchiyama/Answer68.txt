  If there is any confusion around whether Japanese people love golf  look no further. They do. They really do. And while many of my Japanese students would cite "golf" as one of their hobbies  the golf craze in Japan means much more than your general stamp collecting way to pass the time.Golf in Japan is a form of status. To have a golf membership at one of the countries' 2500 courses (the highest number of all Asian countries put together) is a form of financial success and social status.In my brief married life  my Japanese family actually took me to their golf resort which included a posh onsen  hotel and spa.
