He put everything he had behind doing what everyone thought was an impossible act- to walk. Every time you break a personal record  or do something you have never done before  you are setting your own personal records. And some people  will set records for the human race. Thus  a blind man decides to climb Mt. Everest- and he does it. A man with no legs decides to ride across Ghana- and he does it. A fat person decides to walk across the United States- and she does it. Whatever your impossible dream is- you put yourself on the path toward it just by letting it in  letting it take over your heart.
