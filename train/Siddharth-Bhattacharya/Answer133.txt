This picture is from Inverness  Scotland.As I said before  meeting new people. An easy way is staying in youth hostels  and interacting with fellow travelers. Other times it becomes possible while clicking pictures for others for instance.Getting lost. As others would have said already  this ends up being amazing. It kills off the predictability. It's like unlearning whatever you know and learning it again your own way. You will discover cheap ways of traveling  even probably hitchhike and end up in lots of adventurous things you wouldn't have thought otherwise.
