Statements like these deny the possibility of an individual even being capable of working upon their traits when they're classified as being natural traits. Moreover it also imposes the characterization on the entire group  thus disregarding differences between different individuals in the community as well as denying individuals in each community the possibility of breaking free from the characterization. So if Asians are said to be naturally better at Math  irrespective of how much effort individual an Asian puts into his/her mathematical skills  (s)he will be classified as being good at math because (s)he is an Asian as well as being better than another non-Asian who might have polished their skills in math much better.
