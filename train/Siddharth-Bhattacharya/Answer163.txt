Mostly the super-amazing developers who have multitude of options move-on pretty quickly from dying to work at Google/FB/MS and look towards startups for great learning capability  amazing peers. So I'll focus on other mere mortals like me and David Frye who are amused by the idea of working there from long before. Of course it goes without saying the great advertised perks  the consistent ability to make lists of "best places to work for" [1] lists and great compensation are reasons. Add to it  these companies are known for treating their tech employees with great respect--keeping them away from interference with MBAs  lesser non-sensical rules (dress code  timing rules) and it adds up to the aura.
