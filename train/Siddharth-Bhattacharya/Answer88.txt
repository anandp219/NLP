The service provider looks for "return on investments" (RoI). So my appeals for upvotes are closer to marketing than begging. If Quora is begging  I am fine with begging myself. So let's modify the question to "Why does Siddharth often ask for upvotes?" There are mainly two type of people: People who do what they like irrespective of returns- intellectuals. People who expect returns out of what they do- mere mortals. I clearly belong to the second category. "Are you feigning intellect?"No. I admit to being a lesser mortal- not an intellectual.
