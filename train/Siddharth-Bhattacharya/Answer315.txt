However for Goldman Sachs  WorldQuant etc. I think it's very unlikely they consider candidates from non-premier institutes without high GPA and it helps to attempt MBA from IIMs if you don't meet the criterion. For consulting companies  the interview process is based a lot more on soft-skills. For analytics  it's based on puzzles (Tech Interview). Since I don't work for these  I'd advice seeking advice from someone else in these lines. But the bottomline is over a period of few years  these fields offer very lucrative careers.
