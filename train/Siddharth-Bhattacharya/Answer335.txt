In movies it is notable to see Citizen Kane- currently topping various critic's lists- was a huge commercial failure while Men in Black has been a huge success. (remembering the great film-critic Roger Ebert) Why do we need to preserve such texts? As said these texts are rich in social value. Art-forms have always been a powerful form of expressing opinions  dissent and social commentary. By discussing them continually the society has progressed into it's current form- by questioning itself  exploring the answers through debating.
