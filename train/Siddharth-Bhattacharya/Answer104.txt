With the newly introduced fear of going to 'hell' more people start following these moral codes. However few skeptics won't find this God compelling enough to act in the 'desired' manner. So now- you've been tested to the extremes. Apart from trust within themselves  their trust in you is also essential. Therefore you intentionally kept away from exercising power. But with no choice left  you create tangible punishments for not following God's orders. Now everyone takes you seriously & gets to work.
