India is a country where for a person used to peaceful environments their peace of mind is completely disrupted- all the five senses become hyper-alert. Visually  it's overwhelming as in all directions there are people  shops  colors  food stalls on the streets  extreme traffic. Audibly all of these are making noise (we are pretty noisy in public)  vehicles honkering  the pestering boy on the street selling goods shouting and as explained before  the sense of touch becomes alert because there is so much pushing  and lots of people are trying to touch you (with good/bad intentions).
