The following two diagrams reflect the two opposite ends of the concept- the first (Hierarchy of Needs) depicts the needs of a consumer  while the latter (Industrial Sectors) depicts the skills required to provide services for the producer. Ensuring safety needs of citizens is a primary concern of many states  so as to ensure they're able to produce efficiently without having to worry about these. As we see  health is one of those primary needs. Now look at the other diagram- while food production (agriculture) belongs to primary sector and clothing (garment) and shelter (construction) belong to secondary sector  healthcare along with education belongs to the tertiary sector.
