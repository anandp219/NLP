Chinese people on the other hand don't go for MBA programs in US often  partly because there are fewer role models at upper-management and partly due to English (you need exceptional communication skills in English to be admitted into one of these schools). As a result  this becomes a further motivator to return to China (see 2).However it's noteworthy that Chinese immigrants from second (or later) generations are at much more ease with English  don't want to go back to China necessarily so they're doing a good job at upper-management (Yishan Wong  CEO Reddit) and even academia (Terrence Tao  Andrew Ng etc).
