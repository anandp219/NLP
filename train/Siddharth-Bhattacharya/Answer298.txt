1 USD= 30 baht  so basically you get meals for $ 2-3 bahts easily. There are many hotels in Khao San Road around 300-400 baht range. So it adds to my point on backpacking heaven. However if I had to calculate my expenses as someone earning in INR  it could be bewildering for the prices are the same in baht as in rupees in India  except 1 baht = 2 INR.Cuisine: In US  Thai is my favorite cuisine. And yet  it was sort of difficult to find authentic Thai food in the cities except for Pad Thai. After searching hard for local markets  they indeed serve amazing delicacies with spicy sea-food.
