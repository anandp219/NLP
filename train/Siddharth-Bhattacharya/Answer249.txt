On the other hand  quoting Godwin's Law to trivialize acts which actually rival in seriousness (like Armenian Genocide) is a disservice to the people who were victims of those genocides as well as reduces the credibility of Godwin's Law. So the thing to remember is - each of these historic atrocities has a lesson to teach on what not to repeat. We can take them all seperately without comparing intensities. As for why Hitler is chosen as the absolute symbol of bad  it was because the entire story makes for an excellent (revolting) historical symbol.
