  One major impediment to expansionism for Indian tourism industry is lack of women's safety. And I'm not speaking of "few female tourists raped by some bad/uneducated apples". Other factors affecting tourism are poor sanitation conditions  as well as simply how overwhelming India is. I'll elaborate from my personal experiences of traveling with Canadian/French/American/German friends of both genders across India  as well as knowing lots of friends in US who have visited India and heard their experiences.Women's safety: Although faced by all races  specifically for white women the harassment faced can be extreme.
