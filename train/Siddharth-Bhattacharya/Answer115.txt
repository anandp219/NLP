In my personal travel experience  it spanned from photo requests every minute  clicking photos without permission  passing derogatory comments  following on the streets  being surrounded by disproportionately high males in private spaces  constant attempts to touch  actually groping  being harassed by police suspecting the girl to be a prostitute. The list goes on and on. And this is mainly metropolitan cities like Delhi. The notion of Westerners being promiscuous  open about sex combined with judgment call of it being slutty for women reflects itself constantly for a female traveler in India.
