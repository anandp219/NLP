Pic: Clicked on Walking Street  PattayaLadyboys: Of course I knew about lady-boys  but the unbelievable thing was how many they are. I'm sure they outnumbered the "real girls" in these entertainment districts. Some of them are obviously not female  while for many it's difficult to tell. And lots of them are very humorous. For example  when I said no to his/her offers for "massage" they show me directions to nearest gay bar.Poor English: This one really surprised me. Given how much of the economy is based off tourism  it's surprising so many of the natives can't speak English.
