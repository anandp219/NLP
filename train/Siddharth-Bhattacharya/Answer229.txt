Yeah  they don't feel like holy stones or something while touching it. They aren't of absurd temperatures as well  as I was suspecting. They feel just like other stones  but the fact that I was in the middle of the historic stones and touching them was great  much more than the feeling of seeing it from a bounded distance. I could even climb few of the stones  and it feels great to be on top of them (the shorter ones  the bigger ones are too tall to climb just like that). Access to StonehengeOne of the things worth knowing is public transportation is very poor near the area.
