Meanwhile  you can pick up the book Cracking the Coding Interview to see how you can reason through questions  and when you get stuck how the author drives the thought process underlining assumptions and method. I'd advice doing all 150 problems in the book multiple times  and by coding them rather than just thinking algorithm in head. In parallel  you can also start looking for other resources such as geeksforgeeks.com  Leetcode OJ. I didn't do much of the former  more of the latter as compiled code gives confidence.
