You appreciate architecture  but for how long? The lake is pleasant  the mountains are beautiful but alone it loses it's charm in sometime. This does happen. And is countered only by finding other people. Or groups of people where you can just mix in.I wouldn't advise everyone to go for it. In all fairness  not everyone likes an adventure with lots of depressing moments for learning something in life. To me  traveling alone is a high-risk  high-reward gamble. But if you do want to challenge yourself  and can go outside your comfort zone then especially in another country traveling alone can work wonders.
