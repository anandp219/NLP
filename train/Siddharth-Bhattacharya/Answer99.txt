How is it relevant in our world? Statements of the latter kinds become self-fulfilling prophecies into justifying oppression on certain communities based on logical fallacies. In a world where whites are seen as the progressive race and Asians as the model-minority  such stereotypes hamper other minority communities. Within the Asians  it creates higher expectations as well possibly. Since they're perceived to be good at math if they're as good as the next white person but not as good as the stereotype wants them to be  bad luck for them.
