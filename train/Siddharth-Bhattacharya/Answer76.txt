Universality: A part of it is very exclusive to me. When I'm exposed to pop music for few minutes  my head aches. Not figuratively  literally. I've to block the music from entering my ears to be able to do anything else. Such music for me isn't tolerable while sitting in a room  studying  eating  traveling or most day-to-day activities. The only place where I decide to tolerate them is nightclubs where the purpose is primarily to dance. The non-universality of this genre of music is a huge turnoff for me.
