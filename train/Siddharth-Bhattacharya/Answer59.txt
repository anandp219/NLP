So what we're looking at for LS'14 isn't necessarily Congress vs BJP  but a possible BJP vs the others. Including AAP. Thus according to me  it is essential that every anti-Congress vote be polled towards BJP (unless one is both anti-Congress  anti-BJP where one can choose the alternatives including AAP) to consolidate their position rather than split BJP vote-bank from within and put them in the basket of third-front with or without Congress. Some of the possible scenarios as of now are: A government consisting of some of these other parties  with outside support from Congress.
