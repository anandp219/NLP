There's a chance. However despite giving him the benefit of doubt  it's obvious he's not even close to answering most of the questions to the specific levels Arnab requests despite getting his agreement on the same. For instance  when after lots of circumlocution he speaks on the topic of 1984 anti-Sikh riots and 2002 Godhra riots- he tells there was a difference  but dodges Arnab's follow-up questions on Modi being given a clean chit  Congress ministers being convicted. He kept reiterating his words on "due process".
