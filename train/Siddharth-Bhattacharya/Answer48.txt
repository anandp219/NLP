Can healthcare be universal with fairness to providers?It's a tricky economic question  but the best way to do it is not by meddling with providers of services but rather reducing the layers of middlemen involved who increase the cost of service. Industries whose services provided are based around monetary risks such as insurance in healthcare or finance in education. By which I don't mean to monitor the profits of these middlemen sectors  but rather have alternate state-sponsored institutions where there aren't any middlemen between the consumer and the producer.
