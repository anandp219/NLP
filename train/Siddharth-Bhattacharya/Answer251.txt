Any live experience is composed of two parts: the performance and being a part of the audience (the crowds). I will detail them each in brief. Pic: Roger Federer (left)  Sam Groth (right)The game and RF himselfHis shots in reality have the same trace of beauty as on TV. He came to the net a lot  apart from hitting beautiful cross-courts  backhands to clinch winners. The thing which I didn't expect was his serve and shots are really really fast. From seeing his matches on TV  I've always thought of Roger as a man of elegance and not power.
