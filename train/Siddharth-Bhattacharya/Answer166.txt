at a time when I could thankfully make the choice of choosing math + CS major. Google's amazing acquisitions including YouTube  Android as well as amazing products [2] including Nexus  Google Earth  driverless cars kept my fascination while MS (though slowing down and losing "coolness" to Apple) continued to make Xbox  Bing as well as great enterprise stuff such as SQL Server/Azure [3] along with acquisitions like Skype and Nokia (the other company which caught my fascination in those years  but they're hardware--which was too difficult for my small brain).So these things when combined did add up to validation as David says  but the desire to work for them largely follows an association with them.
