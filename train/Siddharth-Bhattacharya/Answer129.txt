The exciting and the scary thing about traveling alone in a foreign country is it's foreignness. This matters much more if you're traveling across cultures. While every detail would catch your attention much more  the lack of company can be easily unnerving. However an important thing worth being stated is much of the excitement of traveling alone in a foreign country comes due to the people there  not just the landscapes  the buildings or the tourist attractions. Indeed if you want to see these things you're much better off with a group.
