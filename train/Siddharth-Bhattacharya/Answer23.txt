  Family pressures In many parts of India  family still continues to be the decisive authority in issues relating to marriage. Moreover previous generations are bound to the traditional values of intra-religion  intra-caste marriage. If children began dating amongst themselves amounting to love marriages  the odds that these caste/religion constraints would be satisfied is low. Therefore families ask their children "to focus on their study/work" and not "loaf around with opposite gender" ensuring arrange marriages eventually.
