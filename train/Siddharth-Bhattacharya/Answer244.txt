Holocaust exposed lots of it  making us a self-aware race of what not to repeat. Is it the worst tragedy in human history?In terms of number of people killed  most probably not. Humans have been killing each other for ages  when entire kingdoms used to wipe out each other in quest for land. However what separates Holocaust from other battles is intent. There was no purpose to the killings  no tangible benefits being reaped. The killings were simply a result of hatred & discrimination. Yet the scale was huge.
