A noteworthy thing is boys are advised against dating as much as girls are against it by their parents. Most boys save the girl's contact numbers in their phones under some pseudonyms so that their "family doesn't suspect". If asked by parents  children have to constantly apply rhetoric of "just friends". In essence if a relationship is to be pursued before marriage  in most cases it's shrouded in secrecy from the elder generation until it reaches the blossoming stages of marriage. It doesn't end at family.
