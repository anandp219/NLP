All in all  Stonehenge has an exciting history and for that the audio device is worth it (although you can most likely read everything online). Seeing the real stones  circling around it while listening to it's history is fantastic. But if you've very high expectations  there's a good chance you'll end up disappointed. Nevertheless the Summer Solstice festival is an experience of a lifetime and added valuable memories to my time in UK.
