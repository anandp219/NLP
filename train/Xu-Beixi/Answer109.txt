A few days ago  I gave my seat to an elderly woman. As she got off several stops later  she thanked me with a warm  crinkly smile. But to my surprise  she turned around and chastised the 30-something man sitting right next to me for not giving up his instead. I do think there is a somewhat sexist expectation there; we were both able-bodied young people  but there is a heavier expectation placed upon him.That said  I've personally never seen "perfectly able women rudely unseat male passengers". There have been incidents of quarrels over train seats  but the only local one that I know of has fondly been titled "Auntie vs Ah Lian*"  and gone viral many times over thanks to the lack of exciting incidents that happen to Singaporeans on a yearly basis:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...* Ah Lian () is a Singlish term for an unsophisticated young woman of Chinese descent with loud tastes in fashion.
