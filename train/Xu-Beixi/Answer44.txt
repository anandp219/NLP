Some examples are the following: In 1997  the allegations for the Publix Super Markets were gender biases in on the job training  promotion  tenure and layoff policies; wage discrimination; occupational segregation; hostile work environment (St. Petersburg Times  1997  pp. 77). In 1996  allegations for Texaco were racially discriminatory hiring  promotion and salary policies (Inter Press Service  1996; The Chicago Tribune  1997  pp. 77). The six black workers  who were the plaintiffs  gave the taped racist comments of the white corporate officials as evidence (Inter Press Service  1996; The Chicago Tribune  1997).
