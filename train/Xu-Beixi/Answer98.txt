  I think there are a few questions here:Can you please state if this is undergrad or graduate studies? Are you local or otherwise? Any prior work experience  grades  achievements?Which specific school are you applying to?What career course are you looking at?Are you aiming for a scholarship? We can give you a better answer if you give us more information. The faculty gets the final say  and certainly  the course is important. If you're applying to Duke-NUS  for example  you'd better have a 35 MCAT[1] score  3.5 GPA  extensive volunteer and research experience  or at least very stellar grades.
