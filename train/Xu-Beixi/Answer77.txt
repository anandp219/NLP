You may have this set of results  but you probably require someone to interpret them as well; the limiting factor then becomes the doctor. In a world where everyone else comes to you  or transactions occur online- the medical profession is nonetheless one where you have to go to the doctor  rather than the other way around. Perhaps that will change someday  and House calls will make a comeback  possibly through more accessible concierge telemedicine.. Here's hoping!Thanks  James. :)
