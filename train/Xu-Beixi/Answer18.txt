Dont corner your spouse with an unexpected lecture  but set a time and agree to start to work through your issues.Be prepared. Before you have the talk  take the time separately to think through the unresolved issues that youll be discussing. What are your concerns in the relationship? In what areas do you feel you need to improve? What are your expectations of your spouse? To put your thoughts down on paper may be best  but either way  be prepared to be open and honest with each other about the real issues between you.
