  I feel like I've walked into a Chinese finger trap. C0mics aren't known for their good looks (except that Anthony Jeselnik).But Drew Carey was once in the marines  which means he was suitably fit  trim  and well-groomed to qualify.On the other hand  Craig Ferguson coulda been a contender  except he was still a little too old in the 90s. That hardworking man has been active since 1980!I think Colin Mochrie could have been a hand model  but that's about it. He's adorable.Thanks for the A2A... I think?
