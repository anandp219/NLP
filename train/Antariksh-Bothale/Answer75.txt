However  if your ideal is 'pure phonetic orthography'  by which I take to mean that you're referring to a system that accurately and predictably represents in their spelling the exact pronunciation of English words  then you are in for a lot of trouble. First  which pronunciation? Even for languages that are spoken in a small area  you tend to get pronunciation variations across dialects  and across speakers. And that's for languages with a few hundred thousand speakers. Think about English  spoken by hundreds of millions all over the world.
