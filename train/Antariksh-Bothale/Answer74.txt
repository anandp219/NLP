  Kinda sorta maybe yes  but like with everything  it's more complicated than that. Of course  it'd be nice if the English spelling system weren't so opaque. It would certainly help if more people could spell English words correctly more easily and learners (both native and non-native speakers) didn't have to waste a lot of time wrapping their head around the idiosyncracies of the English spelling system. After all  most other languages that use the Roman alphabet have a spelling system that's significantly more systematic than that followed by English.
