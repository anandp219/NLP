The problem with replacing 'feminism' with 'equal gender rights' is that it  to a certain extent  trivializes or hides the fact that it is indeed women who've gotten the raw end of the deal across the years  and that actions specific to reversing this need to be taken to undo the mindsets of the people  and the consequence of the current eco-system.
