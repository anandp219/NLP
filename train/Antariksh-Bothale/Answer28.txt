Not only is mindless stereotyping therefore problematic in itself  but in a lot of cases  this affront comes from a privileged group that was often primarily responsible for causing the marginalization of the group that they are now mocking. Imagine being excessively bullied in school  being made to resent your existence  and then being laughed at by those very bullies for being in the wretched state you are in. Now imagine this happening day in and day out. Whether it be men mocking women  or whites mocking blacks  or the straight community mocking the LGBTQ community  such behavior is not too different from bullying.Whatever be the issue  such cavalier commentary is often so commonplace that most dont even realize that it is potentially harmful  and most dont realize that those who raise voices against it arent necessarily doing it for publicity.The second step is to realize that  as members of a class that has historically been privileged  it is not always easy for people to see or notice this disparity or discrimination.
