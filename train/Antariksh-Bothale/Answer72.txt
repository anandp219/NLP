So  there is nothing inherently 'practical' about the Celsius scale  and it could be argued that the Fahrenheit scale is more 'natural' for daily use.It is easy to visualize a quantity double or triple of a given amount; it's not easy to reliably visualize 10x of a quantity. For instance  you can see how big a centimeter is  but it doesn't instantly give you intuition for how big a meter would be. And visualizing 1000 such meters is again not trivial. So it's not like the 10x multiplier helps a lot in everyday life.
