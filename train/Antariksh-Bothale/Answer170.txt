Your ideal of pre-marital celibacy is likely a channelization of the same mindset.And so  coming back to your question. No  it's not really objectionable for you as an individual to want a virgin wife  but you should understand how your innocuous choice isn't necessarily innocuous in the larger scheme of things. And you should understand why most women would take offence at this 'requirement' of yours. [PS: Some commenters are accusing me of 'bashing' OP. I am struggling to find parts of the answer which do this.
