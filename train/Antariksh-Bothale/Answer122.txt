Its important to highlight here that Salman Khan has an exceptional fan following who fondly call him "bhai"  the ultimate big brother; even the fandom SRK enjoys abroad pales in comparison. Thats the closest Bollywood gets to a Rajnikanth. His hard core fans are his extended family and so their sympathy is largely based on emotion and sentiment: the kind you would expect from your close friends and family (See Point 3).The nature of the crime: Many people (especially among those who are likely to read this answer) may find it easier to empathize and associate with Salman since  in the US v/s THEM dichotomy of lawful citizens and criminals  they would find it more natural to place Salman in the US group.In other words  while they will never imagine themselves in a situation where they would be in a place or time like a lower income group laborer who molests a girl  it is not difficult for them to imagine themselves in a situation like Salman's.
