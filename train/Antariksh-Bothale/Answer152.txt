While it is true that this test hinges on one's English vocabulary  the vocabulary level of the GRE is actually pretty reasonable. Likewise  the Quantitative Aptitude section is a general gatekeeper section to ensure that everyone  even those from non-engineering  non-math backgrounds  have a basic level of quantitative ability.We can debate about whether or not the ETS is a giant scam  and whether or not the GRE should be required at all  of course  but don't assume that the GRE is the only thing that decides whether or not you get in.
