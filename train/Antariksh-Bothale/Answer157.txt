One of your biggest enemies  if you are learning a language  is the existence of a viable alternative for communication. Even if you can talk to her in Hindi or Tamil  try to speak to her in English. You can speak a bit slowly if required  or explain stuff using different words. Encourage her  but also correct her as needed. Best of luck!
