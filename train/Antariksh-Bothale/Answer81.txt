You will bore the interviewer and likely make them disinterested. Do some homework on the kind of values the company has. It might be good to show them in your work to improve your cultural fit within the company. For scholarship interviews  it is useful if you can link stuff in your background with the values of the funding organization.If it is a general scholarship kind of interview where they are judging my overall profile  I like to end with my hobbies / other interests or whatever I like to do for fun.
