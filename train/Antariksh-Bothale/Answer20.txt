  I dont think Mood Indigo or IIT Bombay are at fault just because Palash Sen said something during Mood Indigo. As a matter of fact  if anything should tarnish IIT Bombays reputation  it should be the fact that Palash Sen said nothing that is not already expressed overtly or covertly in the male-dominated culture of the institute [1]. The fact that most of the crowd cheered him instead of booing him is more telling. However  these are useful lessons for the future for everyone involved.Is Palash Sen sexist at heart?
