When I grew slightly older and started staying with my parents  they subscribed to kid magazines (in India  they'd be stuff like Champak or Balhans) in both Hindi and English. By the time I was 8  I was reading Hindi translations of Mir publication books such as Fun with Maths and Physics. I grew up fluent in all three languages  and due to my exposure to books such as the one I just mentioned  I am luckily comfortable even with technical vocabulary in Hindi. So yes  it is completely possible to raise your kid in a way that she picks up English  but please don't let her grow up in a monolingual environment  thereby wasting the natural advantage that most people growing up in India get.
