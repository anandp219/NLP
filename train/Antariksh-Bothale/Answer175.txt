As cliche as it sounds  kids should rather be getting the message that they ought to be brave because they are good human beings  and not just because they are boys / men who have to act as knights in shining armor for their fragile princesses.Back when I was in primary school  if any of the boys had very long hair  the biggest threat the teacher used to offer was that if the kid didn't get a haircut soon  they'd put a clip / band on his head. These are kids in single-digit ages  and they are already learning that society considers it embarrassing for guys to be like girls.I could go on and on and cite examples  but I hope I have made my point.
