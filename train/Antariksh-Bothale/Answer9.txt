  I think the multilingual dubs of Let it Go are largely an internet phenomenon; and when it comes to the internet  there is very little to gain by creating content in Hindi  since most Indians who consume content on the internet are likely to know English  and many of them might not have Hindi as their first language anyway.Plus  as another person said  it was probably not worth the effort (and investment) for them because India wasn't a strong target market for them even for the movie  let alone for internet videos.This kinda feeds into the side-effects of the linguistic plurality of India and the dominance of English among the educated masses.
