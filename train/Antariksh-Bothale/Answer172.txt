  One of the top answers on this page (by Robert Frost) suggests that "Be a man" means to evidence the aspirational characteristics of a grown man  such as strength  bravery and control.If words could mean whatever the heck we wanted them to while ignoring the ground reality of how they are used by society  then I could posit that calling a woman a 'bitch' actually compliments her reproductive ability by assigning her the characteristics of a female dog in heat. After all  that is what the literal meaning seems to be  and there is nothing wrong in being called a female dog anyway  right?Unfortunately  the meanings and implications of words  which they absorb based on the way they are used  cannot just be wished away  and even if the speaker who uses them is clean of intent  they can still have ill-effects.
