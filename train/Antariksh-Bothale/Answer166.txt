Simple. Use the term Paneer and give people one of the following options: Tell them to buy paneer from an Indian storeIf an Indian store is not accessible  tell them how they can make a close approximation of paneer from cottage cheese  because if they use cottage cheese off the shelf in Indian paneer recipes  they will not get what they are aiming for.If they are particularly enthusiastic about it  tell them how to make paneer from scratch. It's not very tough  actually  and Youtube has tonnes of videos.
