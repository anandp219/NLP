First language for some  second language for some others  and a third (or nth) language for the rest. Even within what you consider native speakers  you can expect to get a tremendous amount of variation  and it is tough to identify one canonical form.So  whose English would you spell phonetically? Would you spell pin and pen identically in Southern United States since the two words are homophones in their dialect? Or would caught and cot be spelled differently in Britain but identically in  say  Western United States?
