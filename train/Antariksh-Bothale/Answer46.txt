The flip side of this 'respect' is even less independence.The stuff written here is particularly dangerous  since it promotes an insidious culture that conveys the impression that there is a perfectly level playing field for men and women. In other words  it results in women winning minor so-called skirmishes (not having to pay for meals) while massively losing the actual battle (not having autonomy in general). It also leads to a certain feeling of entitlement on the part of men  who are raised to believe that they 'deserve' female companionship (or  sometimes  more bluntly  sex) because they 'did their part' (paid on dates  bought expensive gifts  went around shopping  and what not).
