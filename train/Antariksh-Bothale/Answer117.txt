For instance  if this were a CS degree  and you were going to get into Software Development jobs  you are all but assured an annual income of (at least) around USD 80 K.Job markets can be tough  though  and things can be trickier in Europe  so you should have a realistic assessment of all that. If your undergrad (and now grad) are from prestigious universities  that would certainly make things a bit easier.This also  of course  depends on where the asset is. If it is depreciating rapidly due to any reason  you might consider selling it.
