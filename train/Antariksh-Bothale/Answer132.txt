Did the hostel sports secy just tell you its not necessary to study for next days Maths Quiz because he wanted you to go cheer for the Hostel Water Polo team? Did a CG/Manager just tell you CPI doesn't matter? Did your neighborhood 10 pointer just tell you extra-currics are useless? No one really wishes you bad  but that doesn't mean you take in everything they say without scrutinizing it and looking for full disclosure.I find it funny when the only credential juniors offer about a piece of info/opinion is "Kisi senior ne bola hai" [Some senior told this to me].
