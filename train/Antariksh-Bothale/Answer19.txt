and so on... In each of these  you'd notice that the usual expectation is that you do whatever you are doing really well. There do exist small differences in the preferences of the top 4-5 consulting firms. I have noticed  for example  that one of them has been focusing on very stereotypically academic profiles in the last 2-3 years  while another focuses rather strongly on people with organizational experience. A CPI of 8  however  while being good  probably isn't amazing enough to be a spike  but you should hope that your other academic achievements make up for it.From what you describe  I imagine that at least some consulting firms would find your profile interesting  though they might be a bit skeptical of whether you really want to be in consulting  given that your profile is particularly well suited for academia and research.
