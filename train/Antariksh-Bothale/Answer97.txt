And so there is some pressure towards maintaining the status of your language by asserting that it's fairly complex. Note that this doesn't mean that languages absolutely don't differ in their degrees of learning difficulty. Different aspects of a language may be of varying levels of difficulty for a learner based on the languages they already speak. And it is possible that aspects of a language may take a child slightly longer to pick up. But  in general  it's not a good idea to trust uninformed native intuition about the difficult level of their language.
