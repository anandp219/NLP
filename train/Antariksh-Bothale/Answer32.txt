We all do slip up at times  but given time to look back at our actions  we should realize and own up if they were problematic. Palash Sen has refused to do that  and instead chose to bully those who raised their voice.So  not only did Palash Sen not show basic empathy  he: A) Trivialized the protest and mocked the protesters by making the facetious remark that they perhaps wanted to call him sexy/sexiest and not sexist. B) Refused to accept that what he said was problematic in any way. C) Tried to absolve himself of basic responsible behavior by implying that he didn't need to be mindful of what he said because he isn't a social activist.These are not signs of a man who hates women.
