  There are many places in the world with huge contrasts between city life and rural life. I cant speak for everywhere  but I can offer some UK based wisdom. Ive grown up in the rural area called North Devon for 29 years. The population is of a relatively low density; theres only a few towns. Devon is also home to the largest open space in southern England: Dartmoor.In comparison to Devon (population 748 000 for the whole county)  Ive lived in Melbourne  Australia (population 4.5 million) for a year  visited and stayed in a few cities throughout Europe and the UK and my Significant Other is a city girl.
