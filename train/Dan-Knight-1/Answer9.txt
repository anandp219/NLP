  Indeed they do. National Audio Company is one of the last remaining manufacturers of audio cassettes  yet it's recently had one of its best years since opening in 1969. They sold a staggering 10 million tapes in 2014. I think it's safe to say they still exist.But why?Much like vinyl records  audio cassettes have seen a retro revival. There is a market for the warm analogue sound lost when music is digitised. Probably the thing that has really enlarged our business at a faster phase than anything is the retro movement.
