  Compared to being the father to a baby  a toddler is childs play (geddit?). At 3 years old  my son Elijah is just about 6 months further along the potholed  often sodden road to adulthood from toddlerhood  and its joyous. Hes a miniature sponge  figuratively and  well  he does try to absorb his dinner through osmosis. He even laughs at my frequent lame jokes  which I use as a form of torture. This is a good time to be a dad to a child.Times werent always so rosy  inevitably you hit some potholes.
