Sometimes the obligatory sneeze screens dont muffle your voice as much as you think. Our TripAdvisor scores are generally good  but I did make it clear that if a customer is allergic to pepper  they have a right to tell the waitress so the kitchen can take the necessary allergy containment steps. Unfortunately  the customer heard my complaint and wrote a complaint themselves.Figuratively  you work in a goldfish bowl. People stare. People stare a lot. Its often awkward  downright wearisome and perpetually perturbing.
