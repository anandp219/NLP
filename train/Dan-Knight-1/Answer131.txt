Working in an open kitchen means the customer will come and talk to you regardless of how many meals are in the oven  how many tickets have just come through  how hungover you are. All you can do is try and be friendly and not burn anything. I live in constant fear of saying something I regret in the heat of the moment.Children. You cant escape them. For the most part theyre okay  but the babies will cry  cutlery will be thrown around  voices are always raised. Some children really are the spawn of the Devil though.
