You can see them  they can see you. Sometimes you dont even have to say anything to communicate. A nod or a wink or simply calling out which table is ready for their mains is all it takes. It saves time so the customer gets their food quicker. On occasions I can see the waiters are busy and I take out the food myself  or clear tables  or inform a waiter that a table needs their attention. So  like I said its certainly a double edged sword  but its something I definitely enjoy. Its now 10am on Saturday  time to go and get prepared for lunch.
