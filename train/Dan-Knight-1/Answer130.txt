Introvert vs extrovert if you will. FOH have to deal with the general public all day and  well  some customers are just plain weird. FOH are representatives of the restaurant - always happy to help  making the customer feel welcome and relaxed and are there to provide a pleasing atmosphere (there is a whole lot of two facedness with customers). All of this takes confidence  especially with strangers. Back of house are the pistons in the hospitality engine. They work hard under pressure  in a hot  often greasy environment  to provide the eating experience a customer should expect.
