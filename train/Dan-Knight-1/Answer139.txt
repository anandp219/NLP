  One of my favourite French comedy films is Belleville Rendez-Vous (or to give it its official title The Triplets Of Belleville in everywhere else except the UK).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...The plot is quite simple: A grandmother discovers her grandsons fascination with bicycles from an early age  so she buys him one. Cut to years later  and he is now a contender for the Tour de France  with his grandmother still doting on him  now acting as his trainer. During the race itself he and other riders are kidnapped and taken to Belleville  so the grandmother and their enormously fat dog go looking for him.
