Without money or shelter  the two are discovered by three old women  former famous vaudevillians  The Triplets of Belleville. They invite her and the dog in to stay and help her attempt to rescue her grandson.All of the characters are hideous human caricatures - bodies are exaggerated to unrealistic proportions; this aids itself to the charm of the film. Its strictly in line with the original comic book by artist Sylvain Chomet and provides an original  antiquated visual style. Highly recommended.
