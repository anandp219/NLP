This isnt always down to bad parenting. Ive had children run into the kitchen in the middle of busy Saturday service  draw with snot on the squeeze screens (I have to clean those you know! )  vomit  incessantly cry until a parent has to take them outside. Having a crying child in a hot  smoky  busy environment is just want everyone needs.Its not all bad though  there are some good reasons to work in an open kitchen:Its your show. Yes  people stare  but not always because theyre hungry. Sometimes they are just interested in what you do for a living.
