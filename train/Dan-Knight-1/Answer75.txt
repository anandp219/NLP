When the show in the tank was over  the Archimandrite turned back to the assassin. He put the elbow glove back on  picked another trunk-leech from the pot and strolled over to the man attached to the wall. Do you remember home  sir assassin? he asked as he approached. Is there any memory of it in your head at all  hmm? Home  mother  friends? He stopped in front of the man. Any of that stuff at all? He waved the leechs moist  seeking snout in front of the assassins face as he spoke. They sensed each other  the cold  writhing creature in the Archimandrites hand stretching out to try to fasten itself to the mans face  the man sucking breath through his nostrils and turning his head as far as it would go  seeming to try and shrink back into the wall behind (this would not be the first time the assassin had been introduced to a trunk-leech).
