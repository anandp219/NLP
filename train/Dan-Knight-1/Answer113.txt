You had to make conversation. When it finally happened and you actually managed to go on a date  you had to make conversation using your actual mouth and words and inflection. This was a deal breaker. You couldnt just show your favourite cat pics  or YouTube videos or memes. You had to at least seem interested and engage in banter. You had to make an effort. Back in the 90s  if you really fancied someone  youd make them a mixtape and/or write a love letter. A mixtape would contain some choice songs  usually recorded from the radio  which conveyed you were deep into music and knew just the right song to play at just the right moment of any situation.
