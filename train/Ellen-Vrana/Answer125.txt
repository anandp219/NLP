  I can speak English fluently. Both British and American. I can speak Spanish very well  I've worked in Latin America many times and although it takes a week to get my head in it  I'm good. My accent and syntax is mostly Mexican Spanish but I can do many different accents.I can speak French pretty well but need a few weeks immersed. Have I used all 3 at the same time? Well  yes I have!We went to Morocco this past Spring  our car broke down. We pushed it into a gas station. The guys there spoke a tiny bit of French  but primary Arabic.
