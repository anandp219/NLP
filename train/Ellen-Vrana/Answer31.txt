But to do different 1st person POV or even 3rd  you have to differentiate your characters. That means syntax  pace  phrasing  self-awareness  and emotions need to be unique and consistent for each one. And you have to do it subtly so they aren't cliched (see Marcus Geduld's answer).To repeat one of the things Sheri mentioned  because it is crucial - you have to create a character that the reader cares about  invests in  roots or (or against). If you dance around too much  it can be an aggressive way of keeping your reader from connecting or forming their own opinions.
