is a great way to make sure it is authentic.To be clear  good practice is to use minimal adverbs  adjectives  prepositions  objects and other aspects of speech that can confuse your reader or obfuscate your meaning.We all think and thus talk differently. Depending on how clear you think and thus talk  you'll want to do varying levels of editing. We all have to edit.I write exactly as I think because I'm a clear thinker. So yes  I write how I would talk. Except it's not exactly how I talk. After I write  I edit.
