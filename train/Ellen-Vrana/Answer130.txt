  There are three lists you need to own/watch to save yourself from almost all* movie ignorance. Or  as you said  to know the "greats."1. Movies to seem interesting and bond casually with people at college/new job/Quora.If you want to sound pop-culturally relevant  hip  interesting  with it to the young folk - go with Noam Kaiser's list. It's dead on balls accurate.2. Movies to confidently refer to movies as "film" (and back it up when someone at college/new job/Quora calls you on it). I'll keep the list short (way  way too short)  but I'm happy to go into detail.
