(1950). I'd write this story same way I'd start any story: with an outline. K.M. Weiland has written a fantastic book Outlining Your Novel: Map Your Way to Success  I recommend. I borrow conceptually from it here  but not directly; 1. Theme/premise - What is this about  what are you trying to say? With the concept of "main character is unloved" there are a few ways this could go.Examples include:Someone who is unloved is bound to take it out on societySomeone who is unloved is bound to take it out on parentsUnloved person was really loved all the time  just couldn't see itUnloved person is unable to also give love and will reject love in all its formsUnloved person is actually better at giving love than most people.Unloved person will spend entire life trying to find love.Unloved person can find self-love and live happily.Find a theme that hasn't been explored to death by literature and find one about which you can say something unique.
