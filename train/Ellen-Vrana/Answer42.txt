I.e.  Character 1 comes to another place and meets Character 2 with whom he doesn't have much in common  you might want to make Character 2 have an accent to reinforce the differences. My favorite - James Herriot's books  All Creatures Great and Small  where he includes the Yorkshire accent to show the difficulty he had understanding them  how different he felt as an outsider. He continued to write the accents in his books and they became almost loving.Another example  of course  is Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) where both Jim and Huck have an accent as a way of showing their race  class and education differences (and similarities).Otherwise  you can mention how the accent/pronunciation sounds to your protagonist without actually writing it out; - He pronounced his words like he had chewed them around- Her staccato pace and clipped words made him think of an automated cheese slicer.- He spoke in long vowels and drawn-out syllables  like he didn't want to cede the floor and needed to bide his time.Describe them thus  but write out their dialog in a traditional manner  occasionally using vernacular like Ga'awww or y'all or you'uns when appropriate.
