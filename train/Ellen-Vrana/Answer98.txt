Up (2009) The first sequence  when Carl and Ellie are living out their life  growing older in love. Both of us took each other's hand and from that point  we knew. We wanted to be that couple. No - we WERE that couple already. That is really important. We recognized ourselves and our future life and marriage just kinda fell into place.We looked at rings the next day. I wanted one that looked like my mother's  yellow gold  single diamond. Classic. But they didn't have that. Yellow gold wasn't *in.
