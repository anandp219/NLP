  There are many disturbing truths. To me  the most disturbing is how the actual thing is so vastly different than anything it's purported to be.Marriage is not unconditional love.There is hate. Resentment. There is bitterness  isolation  betrayal and pain. I don't feel love for my husband 24 hours a day  365 days a year. Nor does he. Marriage has inertia.There are times when we cannot access our love. Sometimes  it's marriage - not love - that keeps us married. This thing manifest in shared cutlery and mattresses  Thanksgiving rituals and holiday cards - this thing sometimes keeps us together.Marriage is not the agent nor the perfection of you.It doesn't fill your cracks and makes you complete.
