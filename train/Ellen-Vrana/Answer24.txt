You just have to learn to not have much income or success.You are 'free' because you make your own hours  yes  however 'Free' to you is "can be taken advantage of" to someone else. Oh Ellen can do it  its not like she works or anything.Progress and accomplishment are mythical. Get used to not having any. People ask me where I'm published. I'm not yet.. . But I'm getting better every week! I see the pity in their eyes.Every. Single. Thing. You. Do. Will. Be. Judged. And usually rejected. If it's not being rejected  get a new audience.You create something JUST to destroy it and remake it.
