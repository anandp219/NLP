  PIN number. WRONG.PIN means "Personal Identification Number." You do not need to say the word number at the end of it. When I hear people say PIN Number I always respond 'Oh you mean your PI Number?' which is correct  but moreover causes delightful confusion. After which point I continue 'Yes  every human has been assigned a digit of PI for identification purposes rather than IDs and  wait - were you not there when they handed them out?! DO YOU NOT HAVE A PI NUMBER?!?!' So far only my mother-in-law continued to believe me at this point.
