  This question really affected me and I feel for you because I have been there  many times. Since moving to England  where they use the word mental to mean a lot of things  I say it. That was mental. Or you're being mental (to my husband). I could imagine a situation where it pops out at someone who feels it more deeply and personally. And here is the thing  I have a mental illness! But I throw it around. I do to reduce the power of it  make it mean something less. But as you said  it's less about that word and more about "letting it show.
