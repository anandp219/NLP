  I don't know how old you are  but from this question  I'd say you have a healthy maturity of someone I'd want to talk to and spend time with. Which would make you  in my book  a grown-up. What makes me say this?You wrote a clear  precise question that shows intelligence.Your question suggests self-awareness - a hallmark of maturity and something rarely seen in people even in their 30s  40s etc.Rather than ask a specific such as "why am I not learning " or "why am I not acting appropriately " you summarize your issues in the conceptual term "growing up" which demonstrates your ability to have perspective.Your pose a question that - on first glance - renders you vulnerable to people thinking less of you  and yet you do it anyway  which suggests you have a confidence.You might not be where you want to be in all things  no one is.
