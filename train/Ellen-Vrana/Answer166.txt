  There are a few reasons this could be offensive. Or at least make someone bristle at it and perhaps  question your intentions.First  your use of the word "Mexican." Mexican isn't a race  it is a nationality and ethnicity. It wouldn't be appropriate to say someone "looks Mexican" unless you are in place that is predominantly Mexican people (Like El Paso). Latino  Latin  Hispanic are more appropriate terms to describe a generic individual from Latin America (because many immigrants of descendants of immigrants in the U.S. are from countries other than Mexico).
