Lighting illuminates  what  I don't know. The sun shines down  as opposed to up  and clouds really don't do anything except move.Waves crash. Cars don't.Tears roll down cheeks and faces break into smiles while the eyes always crinkle  when they aren't sparkling  or flashing. Hair shines or curls  always curls. People are clad in clothing  never just clothed in it. Necklaces dangle and bracelets chink. Arms are thick and strong and eyes meet more than people.Thoughts race or sometimes pervade while anger boils.
