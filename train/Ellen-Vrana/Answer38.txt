And are you willing to make the sacrifices it takes?And #4  So cliche. Everyone says "Remember  no one is as happy as they appear!!" Easy to remember  difficult to accept in the moment. It's like telling someone with mouth cancer 'Just remember to not have mouth cancer. Smile!' - OR - You can change your values. Stop prioritizing money  travel  memories etc. Measure yourself on who you are as a person.I know  it sounds hard. Impossible. Money  job  travel etc. are the world's agreed on barometer's of success.
