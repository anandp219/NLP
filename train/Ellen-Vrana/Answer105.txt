Through this process by which we find and expose ourselves we ultimately produce something remarkable (one hopes) but to do so we must constantly fight against the process and the fear and impatience it engenders.Reading  however  is the opposite. In reading we turn ourselves over  surrender  passing agency to someone else. It is patience. It is gratitude. It is imagination extended. In its nourishing comfort I find strength to return to the toil of my own violent and disruptive work.No one can build the bridge on which I cross my life(1)  nor by which I enter and slug through the yardage that is my relationship to writing.
