I would argue Quora answers are not remotely essays (not even this one). The author has to expand to multiple points before it can be rich enough to be an essay  at best they are reports or articles. Medium  however  is more prone to essay writing  and very good ones at that. (Although Quora does have Essayists  like our much-admired Chloe Shani Malveaux who approaches every answer with thoughtful  didactic and reasoned Essay on not just the question asked but the implications surrounding it. Jon Davis is another Essayist).In my mind an Essay is thoughtful writing that dances around an issue  presenting its attributes and points/counterpoints in an effort to fully engage thoughtful  open minds and bring all of us to a new level of thought or awareness.
