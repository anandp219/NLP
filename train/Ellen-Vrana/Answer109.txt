  Oh of course they are considered losers in dating. By some people. Some people consider anyone who they don't understand a 'loser.' And you should be happy about this. It weeds out all the immature assholes who think whether a dude can flirt is a singular measure of whether he's a good mate. You're not a loser to me.I married someone who couldn't flirt. He made fun of me  teased me  couldn't properly ask me out. That didn't stop me from seeing the goodness in his heart and his compatibility with me.
