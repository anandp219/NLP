Your goal is to be A GOOD WRITER WHO KEEPS IMPROVING. In 6 months  your goal might change  your goal might be to develop a kick ass portfolio. Fine. But right now  starting out  focus on the craft. Focus on the writing.4. Give yourself permission to be good. There is something about writing that makes one modest. Everyone is doing it. Everyone is a writer. Everyone has a blog. You haven't published anything yet.... yadda. Wrong. Be good. Be a rockstar. You will get better if you think  read  write deliberately and you will have to face this.
