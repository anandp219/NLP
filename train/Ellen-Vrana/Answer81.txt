  Fiction has more POVs than you can shake a stick due to the combination of characters and what insight we're allowed for each. It's not as simple as 1st  2nd  3rd.. . THAT BEING SAID - I'm going to shake that stick at the most COMMON POVs because they are what you'll use most.This is my view (haha) of different POVs and when to use them.1. 1st PERSON NARRATIONWhat is it? "I" (the main character) am the narrator: I saw this  I said  I felt.... Everyone else and everything that happens is related to the reader through my personal lens.
