Things that happen outside of his awareness can't be relayed unless the author drops the pretense and switches to 3rd person  a trick often overused.- It can be difficult to write. All characters exist as the narrator sees them. Which means while they have their own voice  syntax  personas  those all must be filtered through the narrators view  not full-on. Dialog gets around this but again  it's often overused. - Do we want to spend this much time with this narrator? It might not be kind of person we can listen to for an entire book.
