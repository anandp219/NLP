  Oh yes  definitely. This has stirred the debate on how important security is to a top IT firm (or any other firm as a matter of fact). Most of the big firms spend a lot of time and resources in security training of their employees. Employees are taught not to click on any suspicious links  to not use office internet to browse the web or sites that can bring a potential malware to the firm's servers. Downloading movies or audio/video files is banned in most of the IT firms. But no matter how well you protect your servers and data  there will always be people who would find a flaw in your system.
