And the entire group of friends asking for permission to go to washroom during exams so that they can cheat.Well  that's what the life in IIIT-A is all about.

Especially the last year  when you get placed in the beginning of the year and you have two entire semesters to have fun.P.S - I missed the part about the booze parties and the marijuana marathons because I was never a part of them so I have no idea how to describe them.
