I have done an internship in IISc Bangalore and I know how high the level of postgraduate students in IISc (or any other top college in India  as a matter of fact) is  as far as their knowledge of computer science is considered.On the other hand  if you have chosen this line only because you want to earn and enjoy your life spending that money then stay in the job. Doing a masters for two years might fetch you just a slightly better job with a slightly better package. Yes  the promotions will definitely be faster.
