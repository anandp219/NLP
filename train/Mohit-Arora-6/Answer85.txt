Even though they were calculated assumptions and we did some research and also gathered data from other research papers but in the end they were just assumptions and they highly increases the risk to use such a model in real life scenarios.For example  the biggest problem we faced was to set the "threshold value" below which the transaction can be accepted as a genuine one. In real life scenarios  you will need the data of thousands of customers in order to guess such a threshold value and even after that you cannot be completely sure that your model will work.
