Compulsory attendance is the most irritating thing about IIIT-A. You have to maintain at least 80% attendance and it is hard to mark proxies in most of the classes which means you have to attend most of them. 9:00 A.M to 6:00 P.M - Theory classes + labs. Well  thanks to the teachers of IIIT-A  most students just sit and play with their cell phones or read novels in class. Most of the teachers do not mind whatever you do in their class unless you start talking to each other. They just want to peacefully deliver a lecture they thoroughly mugged up before coming to the class and go.
