Just like blogs  I follow just a few selected questions. So  I read each and every answer that is written for those questions. With the advent of blog post notifications  I panic seeing so many notifications and in frustration  usually clear them all in bulk (and regret later). I know I can use new Quora design of sorting the notifications based on categories but I don't like that design either. Also  I have this OCD of clearing each and every notification that I get on any social networking site.2.
