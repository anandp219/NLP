When Sandy reached his informant's home  the lock on the door was changed. Which means either the informant has turned against the CIA or the terrorists have identified the source of CIA's intel and asked the informant to lure Sandy in a trap. They smartly posted the photos online just after Sandy left the station. They also didn't show their face to Sandy and let the crowd take care of him.Another explanation  which is more likely  according to me  is that there is one terrorist who wants all his associates/partners dead.
