He just wanted an excuse to be a part of all this CIA adventure.Another explanation can be that he wants to protect Carrie. He is the one who recruited Carrie and she has always been under his umbrella. The fact that she is out there chasing the bad guys and Saul cannot put tabs on her anymore must be making him uncomfortable.I am pretty sure Saul will find a way to remain in Islamabad (or may be the circumstances in the next episode will make him). Even if he goes back to the states he is definitely gonna be a part of CIA in one way or another.
