  I believe that one should live their life in a way they want to. If two people are comfortable living their life together in one house without getting married then I don't think anyone should have a problem with that. Basically  the decision is theirs and no one else's. All those people opposing this notion are people who are frustrated in their life and want to direct their anger and frustration towards something or someone. These people have no knowledge of Indian laws (live-in relationship is not illegal under Indian law).
