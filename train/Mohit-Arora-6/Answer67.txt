Also  Deeds was supposed to have an excellent street cred as he killed the "Glory Days". He was supposed to be the tough guy who kills someone and talks about it as if he is having a conversation about Cricket with someone.It might be possible that Marv already had plans for Deeds. May be Marv had planned to kill Deeds after he robs the bar.
