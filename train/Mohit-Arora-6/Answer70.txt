I loved how Rick didn't give a second thought before killing Bob (the cop who escaped in the last episode). He might not have done the same thing in season 1 or season 2. I also loved all those emotions that flowed in the end. Daryl crying  probably for the first on the show  was heart-touching. Beth's death was not so unexpected as I was pretty sure that someone's definitely gonna die during this entire "deal" and the chances of Beth being that someone were sky high.Even though it is almost easy to guess what is gonna happen next in the show  the show has not lost its charm for me.
