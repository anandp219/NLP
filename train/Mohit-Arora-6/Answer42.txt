Even at the bar he would have handed him the money if he didn't bring Nadia into all this. He kept the gun just in case something goes south. I think he never intended to use the gun.Another thing  he was not going to hand the money to Deeds just like that. He expected Deeds to give him the registration papers of Rocco so that Bob can get the ownership of the dog. I think Bob believed in non violence until the point it is acceptable and tolerable.
