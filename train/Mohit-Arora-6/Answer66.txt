  It's definitely weird  and to some extent  desperate of Marv to seek help of Deeds to rob the bar. It was like the director was short of people to cast so they used a recurring character.But there can still be an explanation. Deeds was a kind of person who was not afraid of anyone or anything. He was a kind of person who doesn't think twice before doing anything. And Marv needed such a person to stand against the Chechen mob.He might have thought that no other goon will help him as they were all probably afraid of Chovka.
