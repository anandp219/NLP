  As others mentioned  it solely depends on what you are looking for in your life. It's like eating one type of food daily versus trying different cuisine belonging to different cultures all around the world.There is no denying that working in a tech-giant  at least in India  you will have very few opportunities to actually develop something. You will mostly be working on supporting the product or doing minor improvements. India has potential but it is not yet recognized by the west. In a startup  you might have the opportunity to develop things from scratch.
