  There can be two possible explanations for this - 1. The most important one  according to me  is that Carrie needs Saul back. She needs his support and intelligence. It is tough times for her and it is going to be tougher when her enmity with Lockhart will probably grow in next few episodes. I think we might see Saul in Islamabad (on behalf of his agency  of course) in the next episode. I don't know if it comes in the jurisdiction of a station chief to make such decisions but from the looks of it  it seems so.2.
