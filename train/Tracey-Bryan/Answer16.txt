Race is not recorded on any identity card or record.We are sometimes asked if we're Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) or non-ATSI  because there are some programs specific to ATSI people. We're also asked what race or ethnicity we self-identify as for census purposes.But the Australian government has no official position on what race each individual is  and I find the idea that any other system is viable quite bizarre. In countries where individuals are identified as having a particular race  who decides it?
