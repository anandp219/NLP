Is it a morally comparable activity? No  of course not  I'm not suggesting that. But I am suggesting that it's prompted by the same underlying thinking: the idea that somebody's worth is determined by their gender  or that their gender is the most important thing about them.It reeks of an entitlement mentality that's gob-smacking. Children are not a commodity that you "order" because that's what kind of child you want to parent. Parenting is the most selfless thing you're ever supposed to do; it's not about you.It's ungrateful.
