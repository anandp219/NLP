  In general terms  estoppel is a common law doctrine that precludes somebody - who is said to be "estopped" - from denying a legal truth  in the course of a legal action.The truth can be words or conduct  and express or implied.There are many categories of estoppel  but to say much more is to get into issues that vary according to jurisdiction.A simple example that would be applicable to most common law jurisdictions (by different names) is a reliance-based estoppel  which generally has the elements that one party is induced to believe that a certain state of affairs exists  and relies on that to their detriment.
