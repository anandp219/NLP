  Values  love  and memories are obviously intangibles of inestimable worth  and I hope to leave plenty of those.But when I think of my most treasured material items  they're those that have an especially intimate connection with a loved one  and for me  nothing beats things that they made  such as crafts. It doesn't matter whether it's a stick with crude woodburning  or a magnificently detailed crocheted tablecloth (as my grandmother made for me)  but I really cherish those items that were shaped by my loved ones  and thus contain part of their essence.
