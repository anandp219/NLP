O.o I guarantee that this is not something that would ever cross the mind of an Australian property investor.Australian tradesmen are much more expensive than their American counterparts. Repairs can be more costly here. On the flipside  we have negligible black mold issues  and almost nobody has (or requires) central heating  so there are very few possible very expensive  "invasive" repairs that are likely in Australia.
