In fact  as time passes  it's increasingly difficult to recreate the voice that I thought they had; it's being substituted in my memory by their actual voice.Interestingly  Christine Leigh Langtree is perhaps the only Quoran that I can think of  who sounds almost exactly as I'd imagined. :) I do wonder if the fact that we're both Queenslanders is relevant. i.e. If your imagination makes a closer "guess" for people with accents that you're more familiar with. (Though I still had David wrong  and he's Aussie  too.)
