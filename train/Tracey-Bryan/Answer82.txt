  I've noticed that heterosexual women often find the opposite: that they're more socially comfortable with gay men than gay women. I think it's the combination of "I don't view them as a potential sex partner" with "They may view me as a potential sex partner" - putting aside that this is often false :) - that makes people uncomfortable.We feel a real discomfort when we perceive that somebody else may be sexually attracted to us  and there's no possibility that the feeling will be returned. I remember that when I was a teenager  I found out that a male friend had a crush on me  and I didn't feel the same way about him.
