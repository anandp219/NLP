  Because they have a simplistic  naive  irrational view of the world where people are divided into "good" and "bad".Adultery in  and divorce of  heterosexuals can be an example of "good people making errors"  which they consider worthy of forgiveness.Gay people are  in their twisted narrative  inherently "bad". Targeting gay marriage only punishes "bad" people  but to condemn adultery and divorce would serve to criticise people who look a lot like the very people doing the condemning.It's a hypocritical  bigoted  and - if such a thing exists - evil view of the world and of humanity.
