  They don't have to be alike  they have to be compatible  which is somewhat different. All the pieces of a jigsaw are different  but they fit together to make a coherent whole.Couples  unlike jigsaws  don't have to be completely complementary  either  and one needs to studiously avoid the dangerous concept of another person "making you whole". (Puke. You need to be a whole person before you commit to a long-term relationship with another whole person. )So where should you be alike  and where is it OK to be different?Areas where you should agree (or be close enough to find a workable compromise)How integrated you want your lives to be.
