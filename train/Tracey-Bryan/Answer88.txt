If it had been done 50 years ago  it almost certainly would have ignored gay rights  for example. And it's likely that rights will widen further in time. It's much easier to change legislation  and for judges to adapt the common law  than to change a constitution.America's 7th Amendment  for example  gives parties a right to trial by jury for all civil matters worth more than $20. 150 years ago  that may have been reasonable  but it hasn't been changed. You can still insist on a jury trial for a $20 dispute!
