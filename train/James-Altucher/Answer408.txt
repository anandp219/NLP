I lost my job. Nobody wanted to talk to me because I was bullish on the market and everyone thought I was crazy. Nobody called me. Nobody wanted me. Certainly nobody wanted to help me make money. They had their own concerns. I was trying to get other companies started but I just didnt have my health and priorities intact and as we will see later  those are critical for success. I was just as depressed as everyone else. And it wasnt just that the stock market was at a low. Thats too easy an excuse.
