I am sincerely happy she has been able to make these achievements.Reminds me of a story I read as a kid. Two guys are walking past the Executive Lunchroom at some Big Company. One guy says to the other  look at those assholes eating there.The other guy says  I like them eating there. Because one day I will be eating there as well.Without envy  the entire world is open to you. With envy  you just put a line in the sand  and youll never cross it.
