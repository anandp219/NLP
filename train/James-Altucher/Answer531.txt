Those are all BS books. For me  if I am honest  reading these books has caused me to have more money in my bank account. A) Zero to One by Peter Thiel. Changed my mind about the nature of competition  monopolies and the role of employees. Also check out my podcast with him. B) Abundance by Peter Diamandis. If someone ever "dooms and glooms" you  this is the book to read. The rest of the people are trying to scare you. C) The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene. Not because he teaches you how to be "powerful".
