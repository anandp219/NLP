You can't say  "You can trust me".That's what real estate agents and stockbrokers say. Do you trust them? You can only show by example. I was talking to Tucker Max and Dr. Geoff Miller recently. They are about to come out with a book called "Mate"  about the evolutionary psychology behind how people choose their spouses (and other mating partners). In the book they say that some times the most effective words you can say are not  "I love you" but "Don't worry. I've got it." People want to know you are effective at what you say you can do.
