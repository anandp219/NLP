  Habits dont change in a day. But 1% a day makes every habit work. Every.The reason is: they work if you do a little each day. If you relax and give yourself permission to only improve a little each day  then a good habit works.Its permission to improve. Its also permission to fail. Because when you first start something  youre on day one.If you want to succeed at anything  you have to give yourself permission to fail twice as much as you thought you would.If you insist  I need to change RIGHT NOW  then it wont work.
