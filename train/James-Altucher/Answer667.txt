This doesn't happen in one day  or in one interview. But many experiences with a person. And since there are 7 billion people to mostly choose from  it's not so bad if someone you think makes the cut  falls off after one or two strikes. If you pick your Source correctly  then you have many people to go back to. If you select your weak ties correctly  then there are many people to go back to. One time I hired a friend to work for me at a company. Then I found out he went to my boss and tried to have me fired.
