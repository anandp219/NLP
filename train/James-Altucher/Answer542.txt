Having "Meaning" in life is when you can stake out your own small little way to close that gap. That is the gift your existence brings to history. When I made a lot of money  I forgot to create Meaning in my life. This left me with no "next step" in my life. Nothing worth saying to anybody. Having a vision had helped me make the money. But suddenly I no longer had any vision. So I went straight down. I forgot to ask at the end of every night  "Who did I help today?" B) LISTENListening is the underpinnings of communicating.
