  13 THINGS WAYNE DYER PERSONALLY TAUGHT MEI was scared to death. Wayne Dyer was going to come on my podcast. I read about ten of his books. I watched five or six of his PBS specials. The man has sold over 150 million books. He's inspired millions. He's already given 100s of interviews. What could I possibly ask him?I watched other interviews with him. I even spoke to his daughter about him. I wanted to be ready. I didn't want to ask the same questions everyone else was asking. "You have to interrupt him " Claudia told me  "or he will keep on talking."
