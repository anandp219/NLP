The third time police had to be called on me in life (out of five).So I took her hand and we walked downstairs and she gave me a lecture on what was going on in each one of her classes and she concluded with a discussion of the various Greek gods (Athena is my favorite  she said. Who is yours. Hermes?) And then I saw her yawn and I said maybe now she can try to go back to sleep  which she did.Im scared for her. My mind races also. How many times has my mind woken me up at midnight to remind me of how little money was in my bank account  or how many bills I had to pay  or how much I hated my job  or even hated being an entrepreneur with customers  clients  people screwing me  people hating me.
