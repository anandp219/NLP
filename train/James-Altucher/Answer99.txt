When they first patented Google  they tried to sell to Yahoo for $1 million (ONE MILLION DOLLARS). When Yahoo laughed them out the door  they tried to sell to Excite for $750 000. Excite laughed them out the door. Now an ex-employee of Google is the CEO of Yahoo. And the founder of Excite works at Google. Google dominates. Money is a side effect of trying to help others. Trying to solve problems. Trying to move beyond the "good enough". So many people ask: "how do I get traffic?" That's the wrong question.
