  This is the wrong question. It's upside down.But ok. Another friend of mine wrote a good post on this topic. But I know him and how he made his millions and although his answer was good  it wasn't how he made his money.Money is not everything. It's a side effect. It's a byproduct. It's nuclear waste after all the energy has already powered the Earth.Focus just on the habits. Only the first half of the question.Everyone needs different habits. If someone has an arm amputated he needs a new arm.
