And guess what then happens? Because of that  all of the relationships around me keep getting better. - FREEDOM. I can do whatever I want. I can't jump ten feet. But I don't want to. Don't make me. I'll say "no".I've been rejected by a lot of jobs and opportunities. I won't deny it. I wanted to do those things. But I have a trick: I diversify the things I want. Maybe I won't be a billionaire today. But I KNOW I will kiss someone today. And I KNOW I will sleep ten hours today. And I KNOW I will write most of today and maybe see my kids and maybe see a movie.
