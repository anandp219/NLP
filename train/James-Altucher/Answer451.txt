Because jobs are no longer as stable as they once were.And they are no longer in one or two cities but all over the country or world.So the original reasons for owning a house (a guaranteed easy commute into an urban area where the jobs are) are no longer valid  as demonstrated by the increasingly short lifespan of house ownership.This is a trend that is continuing forever.OPPORTUNITY COSTThe other day my sink broke. How come? Because hair falls out in the shower  stuff gets put in the toilet that shouldnt go there  food gets caught in the pipes  and a million other things.My house is 150 years old.
