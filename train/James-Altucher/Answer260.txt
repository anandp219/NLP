Find someone new to be nice to. Maybe 1 person a day. Just now I looked at an article I wrote in 2007. Someone wrote a nice comment on it. I never responded to the comment. So I looked up the person to see where they are now. And I wrote them a nice thank you letter. Thank you! Thanks! is a good way to get lucky. Mental: I started getting lucky when I sat down with a pad every day and I wrote down ten ideas a day. Every day...ten more ideas. Sometimes I would send the ideas to people. And then some of those people would call me and invite me to help them make those ideas.
