That's a good way to experiment instead of building a whole idea and then watching it go down in flames. By the way  my spellchecking thing spelled "idea" as "ride" at first. That works also. We're all on a ride. Sometimes we pass each other on intersections and we wave hi. Waving "hi" is fun. Then we move on. Life has many crossroads. And we all get to choose which path we can choose at the crossroads. Nobody else should choose it for us. That's the most important habit  life hack  metahabit of all.
