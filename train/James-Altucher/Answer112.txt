If you don't "go to work" then you must be sick or on the tiny bit of vacation allotted to you each year. What if everything you did you can inject a little bit of leisure  a little bit of fun into it. I have fun writing  except when I think I have to meet a deadline (work). I have fun making a business that people actually use except when I think about money too much (work). When you are at the crossroads and your heart loves one path and doesn't love the other  forget about which path has the money and the work  take the path you love.------------"We want to build technology that everybody loves using  and that affects everyone.
