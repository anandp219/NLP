The Oingo algorithm became Adsense which accounts for 99% of Googles revenues. The Applied Semantics deal wouldve been worth about $1bb  $2bb by now. Suffice to say  Google built on the backs of everyone from Lycos to Oingo to Altavista  etc. Superman. Captain Marvel  which was first put out by Fawcett Comics in 1940 was of course a direct ripoff of Superman and yet became very successful.And Superman himself may have been a plagiarism of sorts. 5 years before the first Superman came out  Jerry Siegel (Supermans creator) reviewed the book Gladiator about a boy growing up in rural America who had super powers.Siegel claimed in 1940 that Gladiator had not been an inspiration.
