In one year thats the equivalent of 6-8 novels.Also you can also decrease 1% a day. We can say  aww  its only one day. Dont pressure me!Such an easy choice. It seems trivial. 1% up or 1% down. But it sneaks up. And then were old and lonely.Every day matters.When I was losing all of my money  and hanging around with the wrong people. And taking the wrong drugs and dating the wrong people  Its because I was saying  its just 1 day. Or  I dont need to improve every day  it adds up to nothing.Because I couldnt see how it was adding up at first.
