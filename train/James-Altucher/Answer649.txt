Right now is best predictor of Right Life.---I said I had 20 habits. I can't count that high. So I don't know if this is true. I give myself permission to not be exact all the time.Oh! That's another habit: Give yourself permission to not always be right. Give yourself permission to not always be liked. Give yourself permission to not always be at peace. Give yourself permission to not be a success.Then you will gradually have whatever you gave yourself permission "to not".--Will these habits make you a millionaire?
