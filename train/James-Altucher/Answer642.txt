(Yoda). I have a motto: "I am the dumbest person in the room". Then it helps me to find the smartest person in each room.The smartest person in the room is going to do something. Watch what they do. Something special. Just follow them without asking questions.- Do one thing every day you loved as a kid.I loved to write. So I write every day. I loved being nice to girls. So I'm nice to women every day.Other people loved sports. I didn't.- Ask questions.Brian Grazer  the world famous movie produce or Apollo 13  Arrested Development  and about 100 other movies  would have "curiousity conversations".He's simply call up anyone he wanted (the Dalai Lama  Steve Jobs  etc)   explain who he was  and asked them questions.That's how he met Ron Howard (the smartest person in his room).
