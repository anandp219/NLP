I) Reading is magicWhen you read a book  you get the entire curated life of another person. So the more you read  the more lives you absorb. This gives you more experiences to write about. Reading is critical to writing well. Read non-fiction for ideas. Read quality fiction to get better at writing. J) There are no answers  only questions. Writers ask questions. A writer who provides an answer is not a writer but a preacher. The world is filled with mysteries. Writers point them out  flounder around inside of them  and ultimately leave with more mystery.
