Its ok if you dont believe me. Or maybe you think its bragging. There are many times when I dont have ideas. But thats when I stop practicing what I am about to advocate.Try it for yourself. Im not selling anything here. I have no reason for you to try this. I just want to share my exerience. Its like part of your brain is opened up and a constant flow of stuff  both good and bad  gets dropped in there.From where? I dont think about it and I dont care. But I use it.In early 2009 was one of those times when I desperately needed to do this.
