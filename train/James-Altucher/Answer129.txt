Although not really in that order. It's hard for a small mind like mine to order these. "Mastery" by Robert GreeneThis book is like a curated version of 1000 biographies all under the guise  "how to become a master at what you love". "Bold" by Peter Diamondis and Steven KotlerBasically if you want to know the future  read this. Supplement it with "Abundance" by the same two and "Tomorrowland" by Steven Kotler" and even "The Rational Optimist" by Matt Ridley. I feel "Abundance" is like a sequel to "The Rational Optimist".
