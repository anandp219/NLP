I'm happy to answer questions and I go into more detail elsewhere.Finally I called a friend of mine who is the head of wealth management at one of the largest (top 3) banks in the world. He's the real deal and I just make status updates.He said  "our traders saw everything. Hedge funds trying to protect their fees would automatically trigger millions of sell orders and that kept triggering sell orders. But now it's done. "I get it. I used to run a hedge fund. This is how it works.I don't know if it's done.
