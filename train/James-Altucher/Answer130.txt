So I'm giving you four books with one recommendation. "Outliers" by Malcolm GladwellGladwell is not the first person to come up with the 10 000 hour rule. Nor is he the first person to document what it takes to become the best in the world at something. But his stories are so great as he explains these deep concepts. How did the Beatles become the best? Why are professional hockey players born in January  February and March? And so on. "Where Good Ideas Come From" by Steven JohnsonAlso add to this: "How We Got to Now" by Steven Johnson.
