I published two books and wrote 100s of articles and do 12 podcasts a week. But I don't work hard. I'm about to go get a sandwich. I slept late today. I don't say this because it's so great. I'd like to be a little more effective in my work. It's a practice and not a formula. Every day I practice. Here's what I do. If you don't like it  that's fine. I think each person has to find what works for them. I used to not do these things. And when I didn't do these things  nothing would happen. Life doesn't stand still: it either gets worse or better.
