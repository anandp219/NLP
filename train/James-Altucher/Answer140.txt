And then we took a walk around the park and talked about man y things other than work. Two weeks later he offered me the job. He even offered me a signing bonus. Later that day  my then-boss started yelling at me about something insignificant. He didn't know that I had just been offered a job. I held up my hand and said  "that's fine. I don't like to be yelled at  though  so I quit. Goodbye." He couldn't believe it. He apologized. He wrote me an email and apologized. I wrote back  "don't treat people how you don't want to be treated."
