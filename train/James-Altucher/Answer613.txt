Tucker suggested John Marshall Media . They had done audiobooks ranging from President Clintons autobiography to the Harry Potter books to Freakonomics.It was a thoroughly annoying experience but was worth it.I felt uncomfortable just sitting there for eight hours reading words I had written. For one thing  it hurt. Reading for eight straight hours was killing my throat.Second  I didnt want to just read stories I had already written. So I did it totally unabridged and improvised quite a bit  making it somewhat original compared to the book.But the best reason for doing the audiobook is it forces you to really look at your writing and hear what works and what doesnt.
