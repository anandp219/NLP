So I made a scorecard. I made my list. Did I find her? I think I came pretty close. Argentina was originally discovered by pirates escaping who needed a place to escape the British. Well  Claudia is my pirate and stole my heart. I use a scorecard now for everything. Friends  acquaintances  work friends (who are every bit as important to me as friends)  people who I will do business with (who are also friends  else I won't work with them. Period. )  and so on. It's only in the past few years I've realized that each role has different criteria.
