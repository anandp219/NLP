Are you no longer a complete person? The complete you? If an implant is put into your brain to access Google  does that effect who you view your self to be? When books were invented  memory suffered. We no longer had to remember as much  because we can look things up. Does that make our brains less human? I bet memory has suffered with the rise of Google. Does this mean our consciousness has suffered? When we created fire  we outsourced part of our digestion to this new invention. Did this make our stomachs less human?
