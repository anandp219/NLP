We improve. We have experiences. This is magnificent and abundant success. Just even being able to try new things is something to celebrate every day. To smile at another person. To play.Most things I try to do dont work out as I planned. But who am I to predict the outcomes of my preparation. My only job is to prepare.Everybody  EVERYBODY  is a poor predictor of outcomes. From the weatherman  to the stock analyst. But we can all be good at preparation.And once I prepare  I show up at the starting line.
