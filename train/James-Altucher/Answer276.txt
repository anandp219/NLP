Will this child tell us. Can we tease it to give us a clue? Will the child lead us on the right path or maybe play with us and show us the wrong directions first. It doesn't matter. It's by following the child inside of us that we get closer to the treasure buried at the bottom of an infinitely deep ocean. The ocean that is built from our responsibilities  our mortgages  our bosses  our schools  our governments  everything that puts a roadblock in between us and competence  us and our friends  us and our freedom.
