Someone at the meeting will eventually say  Ill take fries with my burger and everyone will laugh. You broke the ice and you stand out.A waiters pad is cheap. You can get about 100 for $10. This shows you are frugal and dont need those fancy moleskin pads to have a good idea.Oh  and I just found out another reason for a waiters pad while I was writing this. Someone with alcohol on his breath  a bottle in hand  looking like he could crush me with one hand  just came up to me in the cafe Im sitting at and asked for money.
