Two and a half years ago  Hugh was working in a bookstore  shelving books for $10 an hour. On the side he was writing novels. He had no publisher so he was self-publishing through Amazon and then hoping some of his friends or family would read his books. "I thought if one reader liked a book then it would be worth it " he told me. I would give up on one novel if nobody read it. I'm a wimp. Most publishers will give up on you as well. Which is why Hugh kept self-publishing.Hugh wrote nine novels.
