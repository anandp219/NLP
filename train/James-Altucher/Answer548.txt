But I foolishly felt like being on TV was a good thing. So  like everyone else (although that's not an excuse)  I'd pretend to know. And then we'd all go home. Great job! But when I took a shower I felt like I could never get clean. So many things I got wrong. So many times I tried to be perfect and couldn't handle it unless I was perfect. To the point that perfectionism almost led to a very imperfect suicide. Deep down  we're all trying to figure this out. Why are we here? Why did this happen to me?
