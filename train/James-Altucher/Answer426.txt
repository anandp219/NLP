Maybe next thing will be the trip to Mars. 17. I think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.I thought about this when I read it. I think it's ok for "ordinary" people to be ordinary also. Ordinary is beautiful. But I think every day it's worth trying to be a little better (1%  an amount so small it can't be measured) in physical health  emotional health  creativity  and gratitude. Maybe that is a path to extraordinary as that 1% compounds. But I don't want the pressure of "future extraordinary".
