I never slept. I lost 30 lbs. Im 59. I went from 160 to 130. I couldnt talk to anyone. I couldnt move. I stopped having ideas. I cried every day.There was never a moment when I didnt feel sick. I had let my kids down. I would die and they would never remember me.We moved 80 miles north of NYC with the tiny bit of money we took out of our apartment after being forced to sell at a million dollar loss.I couldnt leave the house for three months. I was depressed. I gained back all my weight and then another 30 lbs.Finally I had to either die or feed my family.
