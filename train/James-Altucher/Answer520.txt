The last time I tried that  my body told me  Bad James! On the second day on the job I fell straight to the ground and sprained my ankle for no obvious reason. If you let it  the reactions in your body (any part of your body) will tell you if you are with good people or bad people. When I get an email from someone who is bad for me  I usually get a quick stomach ache. So I delete the mail and put the emailer in Spam. Itss the only solution if I want to be in the 1%. I dont engage at all with anyone who is going to bring me down.
