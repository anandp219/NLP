I used Ryan Holidays company Brasscheck. Ryan was/is the head of marketing for American Apparel  and has marketed many bestsellers including books by Tim Ferriss (The Four Hour Chef)  Robert Greene (Mastery)  Tucker Max (I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell)  and others.I had never before used an outside agency  always trusting either my own basic platform or a publisher. What Ryan provided was unbelievable. Between his rolodex and mine we scheduled about 60 podcasts  radio interviews  speaking engagements  and guest posts on popular blogs and websites.Additionally  other things that I would not have been able to coordinate: A reddit AMA that got over 3000 comments and probably close to a million views over the past month.
