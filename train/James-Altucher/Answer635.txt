Another person might need a new eye.Another person needs to listen better.20 HabitsI'm sorry. I was about to answer. But I need to define "habit".When I was lying in the gutter at 3 in the morning  drunk  and cars swerving around me  I needed first to be pulled to the sidewalk.That was a habit. I couldn't just wake up and be sober. I needed to be pulled to the side first. I needed consequences first. I needed one day at a time first. I needed to surrender control of the outcome first.I needed to improve 1% a day and that never ends.
