Its when you are running for a long time  at the point of exhaustion  and then something kicks in and gives you a second wind.400 000 years ago people didnt jog for exercise. They didnt even have jogging shorts. Or sneakers.400 000 years ago people need to eat and live. And either youre running to catch a prey  or you are running from a lion. Youre the prey! And you need that second wind in both cases or you DIE.The same thing happens in the brain. When you are about to die  a second wind kicks in.
