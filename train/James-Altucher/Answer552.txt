  I'm glad you asked  because someone recently asked me: Why is Failure Good?Failure is the worst thing possible. You feel sick. You feel like youre going to die. You feel like if you dont die you might kill yourself.There is absolutely nothing good about failure. And theres nothing you can pretend to learn from failure.Lately  weve been living in the Golden Age of Failure Porn. Everyone wants to share their story. Everyone wants to fail forward.You cant learn anything from failure because dont forget that every single moment in your past has added up to that one moment in your present - where you are lying on the floor moaning your painful and abysmal failure.Stop whining.
