And here's also what I don't know now: what happens if there is a draught and there's no corn. Because it seems like that has nothing to do with real prices. The price of oil has nothing to do with the supply and demand for oil right now  for instance. So anyone who writes a book on "Macro-economics" is lying to you. Because it's a made up science. And Micro-economics they are lying to you also. Because what you need to know there is how to sell  how to come up with an idea  how to manage  how to build product  and how to be a leader.
