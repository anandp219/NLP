And I still quit. Six years later when I was running a venture capital firm he even pitched me a deal. I said  "Let me call you back on that." And I never spoke to him again. So this is my story of college to establish some credentials. But let me tell you pros and cons. This is the honest truth: Pros: 1) You have sex a lot. There are no parents around. For me  I had a girlfriend for the first time. There's nothing to prevent you from doing anything you want. So you do it. A lot. 2) You drink. I had never had alchohol or drugs before college.
