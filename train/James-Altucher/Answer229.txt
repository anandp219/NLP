You can die tomorrow! Why not protect your kids just in case? And I dont like when people  even Buffett  spread nuclear panic.But I forgave him. We hugged it out. Sort of. He never met me. And he wouldnt pick up the phone the one time I called him. But I took a cab to his house. Hey  wouldnt you take a cab to his house? If you could? (my masterpiece about Buffett. And the worst cover in the history of the printing press)I went to the 2003 annual meeting in Omaha. The Buffettpalooza. I think 20 000 people were supposedly there.
