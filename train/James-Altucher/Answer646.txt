Maybe the first twenty will be bad.That's ok. That means in five years you will be a success. Because of "a little every day".- Don't be in a rush.I've interviewed about 150 successful people so far for my podcast. I don't mean "financial success". Again  money is a byproduct.One thing in common: 10 - 20 years for an overnight success.BUT...Celebrate small successes.Along the way to overnight success (20 years) you will have many many small successes.You can only give yourself permission for the next one if you celebrate the small success.
