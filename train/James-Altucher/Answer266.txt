Everyone thinks they are a fully actualized individual being but that's just a fake. We inherit our personalities from nature and nurture using the machinery the Universe has provided us. We then look at things with the eyes and listen with ears and we try to argue our opinions with the disgusting bacteria-filled hole in the middle of our faces. We shit almost every day. We grunt and sweat when we create new versions of ourselves. All of this is purely for the info-tainment of the Universe. Who records dutifully and then we get tucked back into the Universal fold when we die with no other memory other than the massive Universal memory of all things that ever lived and died.
