I'm also grateful to the random people interviewed 30 CEOs and then wrote a book about it. They accidentally gave me a technique to find my loved ones. Maybe you can use this to choose the people you surround yourself with. Try making the lists described above.What's your scorecard  your source  etc.Or you can say  "this is garbage"It's your choice. But I hope we can be at least weak ties  and maybe friends.
