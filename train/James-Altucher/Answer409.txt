The human race hasnt survived for 200 000 years just to be shattered by a little blip in capitalism. Wed all had a tough decade. We all suffered from post-societal traumatic stress syndrome. The first step was admitting it: Internet bust. 9/11. Corporate corruption at a scale never seen before. Housing bust. Financial crisis. Bailouts. Madoffs. On and on. It was rough. As a society we got afraid. Too afraid to move. So I did the only thing I could do. I woke up early one morning in early March and bought a bag of chocolates.
