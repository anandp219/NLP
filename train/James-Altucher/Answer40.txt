There were drug dealers  prostitutes  every sort.One time I took my assistant with me to be the production assistant on a shoot. She said (I love you Trish)  "Are you like a dominatrix magnet or something?" since we had so many professional dominatrixes we would run into and who were eager to be interviewed. At least 5% of the people I approached randomly.I did this for three years and as I always tell people: I turned over every rock in NYC. There's nothing I didn't know about what goes on in NYC at three in the morning.I went to Riker's Island (a jail)  I went to sex clubs  I went to late-night factories  I went to illegal radio stations  I pretended to be homeless for weeks at a time  I went to buildings with floor after floor of cubicles with naked women doing online sex charging by the second (and this was 1997).And often I would hear the saddest horror stories of what cast people out from the day into the night  probably never to return to normal lives again.I would release four interviews a week.
