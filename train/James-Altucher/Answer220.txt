Now you will turn into a good writer (with 10 000 hours practice and 10 books written). I've written 17 books. 10 of them were awful. I will tell you right now I wish I can buy them back from the publishers and burn them. I will be a book burner of my own books. But some are ok. My reading list should be different from everyone else. But these are the books I've read that have made me a better writer. I bet some of them will work for you. I also encourage you to add to this list in the comments.
