When you make money  keep it. Dont even invest it. Put it in the bank. Dont be greedy for more. You only need to get rich once. Unless you want to buy a basketball team you dont need to get rich twice. And only when you are confident you can Keep it  you can THINK about growing it. But that takes a year or two first of keeping it. Please trust me on this one. Almost every failure I know (and I know a lot) didnt fail because they couldnt make money. They are broke now because they couldn't keep it.
