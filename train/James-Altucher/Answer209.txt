Only you get to choose what is in your universe.When you dont choose  you excuse.S) IS IT REALLY WORTH IT TO BECOME AN IDEA MACHINE?Every day I come up with ideas. I havent had a business since 2009. And it failed  as mentioned above.Since then Ive made more money than I know what to do with because I come up with ideas for people  for companies  for me  for people who have no idea who I am  for random anonymous things.I then get invited to share my ideas. Sometimes I get paid for them. Sometimes I give them for free.
