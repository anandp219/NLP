And I don't say "yes" to things I don't want to do. Else I resent the person who asked me  I hate myself for saying yes  and I'm bad at whatever it is I said "yes" to. So  in order to work harder  I try to find as much NOTHING in my life as possible. - EAT WELLIt's a simple diet but I try to follow it. No snacks. No eating after 6pm (so my liver isn't on overdrive when I am trying to sleep). Plates at 10 inches. (Studies show when you reduce plate size from 15 inches to 10 inches  you eat 30% less calories).
