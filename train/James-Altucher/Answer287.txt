I wandered into areas I had never been before. I was confused where I was. I was confused why other people were out at 10 in the morning. Why weren't they at their jobs? I wandered from confusion to confusion. Eventually  I started a project  "3am" trying to figure out why people were out at 3 in the morning on a Wednesday night. I was confused and wanted to know. When I do a podcast and someone gives the stock answer they give in every other answer  I get confused. "But didn't you cry when that company failed?"
