There's no one answer how to find your passion. But every day  give the child inside of you some exercise using the 10 ideas above. Mix that child with the experience you've learned over the years of fire and ice. You'll find your passion. Your passion will find you. And it's there  in that kiss of passion and you  in that kiss of your inner child and your outer adult  that you will find it. In the middle its there  torn asunder but ready to be put together and to come out and play.
