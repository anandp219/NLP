One of the most important decisions you can make in life is who you spend your time with. It's like falling into an sea of hands and hoping they catch you. When you surround your self with good people  you can surrender that they will catch you. When you are creative  you can surrender to the fact that your ideas will always catch you.When you sleep well and are grateful  you can surrender to the fact that your good health and spiritual attitude  will guide you through the difficult moments.
