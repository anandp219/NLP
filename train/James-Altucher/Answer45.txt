The last thing I want is for them to think  "ugh  I can't believe he asked me that".I know from prior interviews I've watched what questions they've been asked and what questions they are totally sick of.Also by looking at prior interviews  I know the stuff they are just beginning to reveal and have never revealed before. This gives me ideas of where to explore further.B) GET THEM COMFORTABLEWhen I interviewed Peter Thiel  at first he was busy so I had to call back. When he got on the phone my first question was  "So what have you been up to today?"
