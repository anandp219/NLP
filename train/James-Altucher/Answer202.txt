Or the ten ugliest men (if I take picture of the ten most handsome men then I might get jealous and thats a whole other thing Id have to deal with).Or I might come make ten prank calls (well  when I was a kid I did that. I never do that now! Maybe).O) IS IT IMPORTANT TO READ BEFORE WRITING?I dont know. But I do. Heres what I do:At any given point I have about 10-20 books on my to go list. Books that I can just pop in and continue reading.Every day I read at least 10% of a non-fiction book that gives me tons of new ideas  an inspirational book  a fiction book of high-quality writing  and maybe a book on games (lately Ive been solving chess puzzles).
