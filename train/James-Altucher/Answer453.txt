So he ripped up floors  cleaned out mold  fixed furniture  and took care of it.This time I was upstairs reading a book.FLEXIBILITYSome people like to know where they will be in 30 years. They feel comfort in that.When you rent  you never know if you will be kicked out eventually or if the house will get sold and you have to move.So there is no judging here. But I like flexibility in my life. I like to know I can move. And in my area  so many houses are for sale  I always know I can find a good place to rent.And with so many houses for sale  I know those people are stuck while I am not.Will it always be that way?
