I guess same with "The Untethered Soul" by Michael Singer. 13) Born Standing Up by Steve Martin. I love standup comedy and to see this part of his autobiography basically taught me the art of autobiography and excellence. 14) No One Belongs Here More Than You by Miranda July. She is a love addict. I feel I am one also. Reading this collection of stories taught me how to write about it. 15) Person by Sam Pink and Spectacle by Susan Steinberg. Their entire personalities are reflected in their literally styles.
