The only way to learn something is to have a passionate interest in it  then learn it  then repeat it  then try to teach it to someone else. This is not something taught in school. Kids are taught facts and not questions. And yet questioning the world is how all knowledge is learned. After college  80% of people never pick up a book again. If you just read 5 pages a day (10-20 minutes of time. The time it takes to read People Magazine) of something you are interested in  you'll read 1800 pages more per year than everyone else.
