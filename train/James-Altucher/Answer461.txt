Your brain thinks  Ive just made the biggest investment of my life so it must be right.Your brain loves you. It doesnt want you to think it made a bad decision for you. Its scared you wont use it anymore.So it tells you  that $200 000 down was the best decision you ever made. Everything else involves flushing money down the toilet  or no roots  or no stability! So its hard to consider the alternatives.Its a lot of work to own a house also. Have you ever spent time in the Death Star? I mean Home Depot.
