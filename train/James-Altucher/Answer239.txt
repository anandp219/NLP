They drove around and had a rambling conversation. At one point they passed a furniture store and the investor pointed out the window  Im going to own that one day.Obviously  that investor was Warren Buffett. But Smith didnt know then that he was dealing with WARREN BUFFETT because he wasnt in all-caps yet. And  in fact  many years later Buffett did buy that furniture store.I thought Supermoney was fascinating for its predictive abilities. How could Smith know that Buffett would be the best investor to profile?
