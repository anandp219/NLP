This  he said  was how compassion is created. Compassion then cradles the suffering like a mother cradles a baby.And this is then how you learn to have compassion for the suffering in others. The pain we all feel. The loneliness we all feel. The regrets and uncertainty.Every breath is a miracle.It proves we are alive again! and he laughed.During the day I sometimes think my breathing is so shallow when Im on the computer I have to stop to take a deep breath.I just read in the book Crazy Sexy Cancer that how we breathe can help us battle cancer.No mud  no lotus.This phrase was on one of his calligraphy drawings.The lotus flower is beautiful  but comes from the mud.
