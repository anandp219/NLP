It's only the people who push past the "good enough syndrome" that we hear about: Elon Musk building a space ship. Larry Page indexing all knowledge. Elizabeth Holmes potentially diagnosing all diseases with a pin prick. Isaac Asimov wrote classic science fiction like "The Foundation Series" but it wasn't good enough for him. He ended up writing 500 more books  writing more books than anyone in history. Larry Page keeps pushing so that every day he wakes up knowing he's going to go past "good enough" that day.
