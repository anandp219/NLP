But first you have to climb many hurdles  of which earning the money is only the first. Very few things are better than earning a lot of money.Money finds a home only in places where its appreciated. I didnt appreciate the money. So it left me.When we were in the car  driving to our new home back in 2002 it was in the middle of a snowstorm. I wanted to cry I felt so bad about what was happening. But it was too much to think about. So for a brief moment I watched the snow and remembered what it was like to be a kid.
