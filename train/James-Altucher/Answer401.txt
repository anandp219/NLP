Listening is a form of improving relationships with others. Listening is a way to outsource good ideas since if you let many others talk  some of them will give you good ideas you might not have thought of. Buddha didnt start a major religion by talking. It started because he sat under a tree and listened. Jesus spent 40 days in a desert. Listening. Moses listened to his wife (err.I mean a burning bush). Everything that has moved history happened because of listening instead of talking. Talking inspires.
