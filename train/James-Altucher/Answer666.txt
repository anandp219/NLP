Three or four great friends. Ten medium great friends. And 100 weak ties. So you want to make sure you Select well  given your scorecard and your source.So I make lists of questions I want to know. Given the 1000s of bad experiences I've had (see "face down drunk on Lexington Avenue at 3 in the morning" article or "the time I lost 7 million dollars in one day article") I now make sure people meet the criteria. Else  a lot of time  money  and heartbreak can be lost. I hate heartbreak. And I hate losing time and money.
