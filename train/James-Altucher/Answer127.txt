I like reading books where I feel my brain have an IQ orgasm. Like  I literally feel my IQ go up while reading the book. Before I give my list  I want to mention there are three kinds of non-fiction books: - BUSINESS CARD BOOKS: These are books like "How to be a leader". They establish the author as an expert. The author then uses this book to get speaking gigs or coaching or consulting gigs. These books usually suck. Don't read one. But nothing wrong with writing one. - BOOKS THAT SHOULD BE CHAPTERS: A publisher will see an article somewhere like  "12 ways to become smarter" and say  "that should be a book".
