I couldnt get on the NYT Bestsellers List because they do not look at books that do not appear in bookstores. Im not in any bookstores at the moment although Im working on ways that can change. Suffice to say I wouldve hit that list as well as the WSJ list.Altogether in the first month I sold 44 294 copies between my paperback  audio  ebook  and even hardcover versions. The hardcover version was sold via an email newsletter run by Porter Stansberry that bundled the hardcover with 3 free versions of my past books plus an original report written by me.
