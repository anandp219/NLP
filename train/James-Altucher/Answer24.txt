Plus I was broke. In other words  a perfect catch. Maybe I would spend three or four hours a day on online dating sites. That's how hard a guy like me would have to work to get even one response on a dating site. Hundreds of messages. Finally  one woman responded. I won't get into the details of our first few dates. But I liked her. In fact  because of the low levels of emotional maturity I had  I even thought I loved her. Maybe it was true. Maybe it was true. One time she offered to cook me dinner.
