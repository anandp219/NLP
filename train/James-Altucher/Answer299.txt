I write about the past but I won't live in it anymore. I've written 18 books. I've written 1000s of articles. I probably write over 1 million words a year. One of my books has sold over 300 000 copies. My last book has sold about 50 000 copies. I have a book coming out on September 1. Here's what full time writers know. A) Writers don't make moneyI mention the $200 check above. That's not real money. I had two kids  rent  etc. You have to make more than that to pay the bills. Even when I sell 300 000 copies of a book.
