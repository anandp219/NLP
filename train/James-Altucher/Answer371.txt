Compounding tiny excellence is what creates big excellence.You cant be a master in one day. You have to improve a little every day.Picasso created 2 works of art a day. Thats 50 000 in a lifetime. It adds up.But its too late for me!.No  its not. Compounding creates fast results.If I read 5 pages a day from non-fiction books  then in a year I will have read 1830 pages of knowledge. And each page I read will build upon the pages Ive read before.And its 1830 pages 99% of people wont read. Most people dont pick up a book after age 20.If I write 1000 words a day  then in one day thats nothing.
