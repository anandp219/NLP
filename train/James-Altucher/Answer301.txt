C) First you typewrite  then you write. Get the first draft done no matter what. Then the real work begins. Take out the first paragraph. Take out the last. Take out every other word. Sculpt the ugly mass of clay you are left with. People say this is rewriting. I prefer to think of this as sculpting. Too many people agonize paragraph by paragraph. Rush to the finish line. Then go back and walk over every step you made and see what you can do better. This is the real gift you give your reader. D) You can't waste more than six seconds of someone's time.
