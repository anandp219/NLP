----When you build a business  or you are doing work that is important to you: you shouldn't hire people you love. Because love might hide the things that are very important for you completing your job. I might love someone who can't spell. So I shouldn't hire them to spellcheck. Claudia  my wife  works with me on a lot of projects. We even do a podcast together.But that was after years of relationship where we got to know each other and what we were good at and what we were bad at. If I were to disappear tomorrow  she could probably pretend to be me.
