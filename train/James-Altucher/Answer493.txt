Oh  but it does. It does! 28. Kindness. Do it and reward it. Punish non-kindness. If you are kind  people will want to be around you. If you reward it (by smiling  or saying something nice) then people will want to be kind to you. If someone is not kind to me  then I back off. No matter who they are. I don't even let family be not-kind to me. Once we die  they are not my family anymore. This is how you get the "five" that will help you "be the average of the five people around you". 29. Net-netEveryone wants to go on a strict diet.
