For everything everyone says  including me  there's a good reason (which is hard to argue with) and a real reason. Always look for the real reason. 8. 80/20 rule cubed. Everyone knows that 20% of your employees (or 20% of your efforts  or 20% of the seeds planted)  produce 80% of the value (or 80% of your profits  or 80% of the flowers that blood). But let's square it. So you apply the 80/20 rule on top of the 80/20 rule. And let's square that. So now 1% of your prior efforts produce almost 50% of the value.
