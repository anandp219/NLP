I had never felt that before but somehow having a significant amount of money gave me permission to want to have kids. Safety. For the briefest of moments  I felt safe  like nothing could harm me and I could live forever. In 1999 I visited the Chairman of a company I was a shareholder of. I was in LA and he picked me up at the hotel in his latest Porsche. We drove to his enormous house and he gave me a tour. When we sat down he told me  I dont even have to do this anymore. I have so much money now that nothing can touch me.
