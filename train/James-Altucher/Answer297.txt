If you feel should then you might not be in love.These are things I feel when Im in love. Love comes and goes. And comes and goes. Its ok to not be in love. And its okay to be in love forever.Im married just a few years. And Im divorced before that. So I know nothing.If you become unhappy  then maybe the love was just a passing love. Dont fall into the trap of love when it is just want. You learned from each other and now can move on.Thank god you met. And now thank god you can leave each other at the right moment.Thats a love that lasts forever.
