You cant love until you forgive yourselfbut you have to remember.Whenever you think you know something  leave an empty box open inside your head so other people can put new things in there.Love is:Love is when you have no demands on the other person. Not even to make you happy.Love is when you care what they do  but dont worry about what they are doing.Love is when they say or do something insignificant and you feel  SURPRISE!Love is when you miss them  but dont require them.Love is when they are right all the time  even when they are wrong.
