We're not really smart enough to come up with the right answers. But if we listen carefully  we can ask the right questions. One question leads to another. 1000 questions might lead to one answer. One solution. I've done 100s of interviews. A bad interview is when you have pre-canned questions and you already know the answers. A good interview is driven by curiosity. Dig a little deep. Get someone to take off the masks a little but so you can see who they really are. People love people who ASK them.
