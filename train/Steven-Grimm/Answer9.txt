  First  decide which Taiwanese accent you want  because there's more than one. Broadly speaking  southerners and northerners have noticeably different accents; the accent in the south is further removed from standard Mandarin. There are smaller regional variations but south-north is the big obvious split.Assuming you want to sound like a southerner  here are a few of the obvious differences that you can practice on your own. All my formal instruction in Mandarin used a standard mainland putonghua accent (which I did my best to pick up) but I married a woman from southern Taiwan  just so you know what perspective this is from.
