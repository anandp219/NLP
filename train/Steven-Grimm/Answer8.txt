At the same time  there is a significant independence movement in Taiwan that wants the island to be recognized as its own separate country  full stop.Competing under the name "Taiwan" would  to some people  be an implicit statement that Taiwan isn't part of China. "Chinese Taiwan" would upset the pro-independence camp by effectively stating that Taiwan is part of China. "Chinese Taipei" skirts the question well enough to satisfy all but a small minority of people on either side  and everyone can get on with enjoying the games.Hong Kong  which is universally recognized as part of China  also competes in the Olympics under its own banner rather than as part of the Chinese national team  which has the side effect of bolstering the ambiguity of the Taiwanese team's status.
