  It is sometimes easy  but not always easy and sometimes not possible at all.The crux of the problem is that it's hard to tell when you incorrectly conclude that someone is a native speaker. Short of going around and asking all the writers on Quora whether or not they're native English speakers  how would you confirm your judgement?I can often tell whether a particular mistake or awkward turn of phrase is likely to have come from a non-native speaker. There are indeed patterns of writing that are vanishingly rare among natives  and when I see one of those  I immediately know that the writer learned English as a second language.
