That gave the writers ample opportunity to do world-building. A frequent feature of stories of that era was that a lot of screen time was devoted to the guest characters  showing their situation in detail and developing their personalities -- whereas the modern series is almost always from the point of view of the Doctor or his companion  the original series often presented the points of view of the people living in whichever place the story was set. This gave the stories more depth and allowed the writers to build more complex  detailed worlds.That difference extended beyond mere screen time.
