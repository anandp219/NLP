The new series' stories tend to be driven forward by the Doctor. He is unambiguously the most important character not just of the show as a whole  but of each story's narrative. In some cases it's fair to say that absent the Doctor's arrival  nothing interesting would have happened in the places he visited. The original series sometimes took that approach  but more often  the Doctor arrived in the middle of events already in motion  and the guest characters were active players in the narrative.Of the new series  I'd say the two-parter "The Impossible Planet" / "The Satan Pit" came closest to the storytelling style of the original series.Both versions of the show have their merits and both of them have lousy episodes as well as brilliant ones  but for me  if you can get past the shoddy sets and laughable special effects  the old series is  by and large  the better of the two.
