By the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) the pace picked up. For my money  the storytelling in the episodes for Doctors 3-5 was the best of the show both pre- and post-reboot. The show started to run out of steam by the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) with less-interesting stories.During the years of Doctors 3  4  and 5  the show benefited a lot from its format  despite the need for cliffhangers David Stewart's answer mentions. Most stories were four half-hour episodes  roughly double the length of a standalone episode of the new series.
