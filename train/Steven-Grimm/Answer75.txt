  No. Snakes  like other reptiles  are cold-blooded animals  which means they depend on their environment to maintain their body heat. In the wintertime in areas with cold weather  snakes go into a dormant phase called brumation  somewhat similar to the hibernation of various mammal species. They may wake up briefly and emerge from their hiding places to seek water  but aren't slithering around looking for people to bite  and will avoid venturing out into the open since the low temperature makes them very slow and vulnerable to predators.Also  snake venom doesn't freeze your blood.
