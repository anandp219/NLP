You actually might end up happier in a house that is not your first choice. But it's nice to have a choice.First off  evaluate your "package". I am told that girls submit these resumes  which include high school transcripts  extracurricular events and "other" things. What is interesting about you? Did you study abroad for a year? Play varsity golf? Compete in a national science fair? These special things will get you noticed  so play up your interestingness.If you are from out of state  or better yet  a foreign country  that also ups your interestingness.
