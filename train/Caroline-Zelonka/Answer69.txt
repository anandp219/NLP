(Although I realize that hair transplantation can look natural  but I hear it's expensive and probably uncomfortable. )Back in the 1990s  when the shaved head came into its own  the first impression I got was one of boldness and confidence. Now that the style has gone mainstream  I don't get that impression as much. But again  baldness speaks to confidence  regardless of gender.Full disclosure: The man I'm dating had a full and bushy head of hair in his youth  but once it started to thin significantly.
