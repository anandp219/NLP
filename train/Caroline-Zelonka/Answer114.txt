And that game-playing is a good way to nurture relationships with members of the poon class.Ugh  I could get mad. But it's so pathetic. It's like listening to Tea Party conservatives drone on about Obama's Kenyan birth  or the chemtrail conspiracy theorists insist that some evil force is controlling the weather.There will always be fringe fanatics on either side of an issue (feminism isn't really an issue  but some people make it out to be). Heartiste falls into this fringe category. It's off-putting  but it's mostly just stupid and pathetic.Edit: the question has been updated to read "what do feminists think of women who like Heartiste."
