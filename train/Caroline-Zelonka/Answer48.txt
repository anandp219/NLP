  On the contrary  many intelligent people will keenly understand the impact their physical presentation can have on their lives. From an early age  you realize that people who look a certain way (cute  strong  intelligent  intimidating  meek  slovenly  confident -- pick your adjective) tend to get treated differently in certain situations.As one gets older  it becomes more apparent that  say  a boy whose body is large and strong will be less likely to be physically intimidated by bullies. A girl with nice skin  straight teeth and a slender body is more likely to be chosen for the Homecoming court.
