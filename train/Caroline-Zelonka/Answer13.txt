You can do it by being professional (making sure your communication is buttoned-up  delivering your documents in a clean  neat and meticulously proofread). And you can do it by being friendly and easy to work with  even when you are not dealing with the client directly.If you think you will need more time  ask well in advance. If you don't understand aspects of the assignment  research them on your own and then get back with specific questions. Try not to put down the client or their judgement; if you disagree with something  be prepared to defend it  keeping the client's end goal in mind.
