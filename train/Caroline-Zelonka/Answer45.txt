Sure  you could ask to answer folks  but honestly  the types of users likely to contribute great solicited answers were usually filthy credit-rich anyhow.I am a little sad about the loss of Promote  but honestly  I never saw a positive ROI (which a credit-counter may care about). I mainly promoted answers because I felt they deserved a bump in views or I wanted to encourage a user somehow. The user encouragement metric  I feel  did lead the promotion of mediocre or limited-interest answers  which is one of the reasons Quora gave for the change.
