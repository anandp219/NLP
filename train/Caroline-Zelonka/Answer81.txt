Seriously  that's not even discussed during Rush Week. Many sororities  in my day  had explicit rules for what you could bring up about a rushee -- to avoid nastiness. They mostly want to make sure you will fit in with the rest of the girls  make the house look good (academically  as in Alpha Chi's case; they recruited a lot of science/engineering/pre-med majors and high GPA was very important; to some sororities  sports and student clubs are a big deal; every sorority will want its share of beauty queens  cheerleaders  Miss So-and-So's etc.
