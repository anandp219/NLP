while others bemoaning their relative pauper status ("I feel lame; I never broke 700k..." or even "I might hold the record of one of the poorest QTWs. ")What do I think about it? Other than enjoying the kerfuffle (and by enjoying it  I don't mean in a snarky way; the social scientist in me is enjoying seeing the reactions to something that is  at its heart  completely trivial)  I don't care.Though several Quorans  such as Archie D'Cruz  found some meaningful way to use the credits  more often than not  they were essentially useless.
