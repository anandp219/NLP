You can hallucinate  vomit  feel dizzy  or get really paranoid -- it can be extremely unpleasant. Plus  the onset of the high takes a while -- about an hour or two -- in which time many inexperienced users will end up consuming too much because they don't feel anything. If I were you  I'd avoid heavy indicas (and indica hybrids) and stick to the sativas. This is not a hard-and-fast rule  but indicas tend to produce a heavy-limbed  sleepy  munchie-inducing high  whereas sativas tend to instill euphoria  giggliness  creativity and other  more social effects.
