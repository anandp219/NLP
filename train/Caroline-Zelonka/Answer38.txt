Then I would dust it with face powder and set it with a liquid bandage product. (My fake eyebrow routine took some time and a lot of experimentation to perfect  if you couldn't tell. )Flash forward 15 years and my eyebrows are more or less nonexistent. I've moved on to an eyebrow powder  which has some texture and sets well on bare skin. It's funny  now that I think about it  my entire makeup routine basically evolved around my lack of eyebrows and refusal to wear bangs (I could cover up the eyebrowlessness better this way).What happens when I don't wear eyebrow pencil  or makeup for that matter?
