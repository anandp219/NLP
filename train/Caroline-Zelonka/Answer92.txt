A lot of people will be tempted to press the "like" button to show support  but it's set up to backfire if the news is bad. (I am never one to judge someone for "liking" a bad-news post  but there are a lot of judgy people out there who may be quick to label the likers as insensitive or whatever.) But you can always say  "Celebrating the life of my brother  who passed away unexpectedly today ...." A picture with dates is good  as are stories or anecdotes. If you want to express your grief  that's totally fine  too.
