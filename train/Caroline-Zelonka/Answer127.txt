  So many cynical answers! I think it's more a case of temporarily suspending disbelief  like people do when watching a fantasy or science fiction movie. Haunted locales  houses especially  generally have some beautiful but eccentric features which kind of give you the willies -- just like the setting of the science fiction movie.If the movie goes on to explain things using junk science  you could immediately dismiss the rest of the plot. Or you could imagine what it would be like to be in that scenario.
