I'm pretty generous with my upvotes. If an answer makes me think  or gives me even one nugget of insight  it will get my vote  sure. Granted  I may also register my disagreements (or opposing viewpoints) in the comments  but I do like to read things I do not agree with  because I am not interested in ossifying my opinions anytime soon.
