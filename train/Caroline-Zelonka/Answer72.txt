(In some cases  they will give you antibiotics and/or pain pills to tide you over. )Dentists will leave slots in their day to deal with emergencies  like broken teeth  but dental problems do not generally progress that fast. If they're scheduling you for 6 months out  you're doing pretty well -- my own dentist has me come in once every four months -- some patients are on an even shorter schedule.If you have a more complex issue  they may refer your case to a periodontist or oral surgeon. But typically  unless your teeth are severely neglected  or damaged because of trauma as I mentioned earlier  it's not like a regular  healthy patient is suddenly going to go from "tooth watch list" to "dire dental emergency" in 6 months.
