For example:2 cups raw cabbage with 1 tbsp. low-fat dressing (under 100 calories)One raw apple with 1 oz. low fat cheese (about 150 calories)Two cups popcorn with 1 tbsp. melted butter (about 15o calories)One hard-boiled egg (about 80 calories)8 oz. 1% milk (110 calories)I am also going to be a contrarian on this "don't get so hungry you can't sleep" thing. In my experience  if you're not hungry when you're asleep  your weight loss is likely to go a lot slower than if you get up to satisfy your hunger.
