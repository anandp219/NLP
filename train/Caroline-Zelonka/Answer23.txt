Every once in awhile you might find an especially-dog-eared bodice ripper to provide some erotic entertainment (if you don't mind it's well-used appearance) or a trashed copy of a favorite trashy novel  but most of these LFL books are just shit.And there are just too many of them. And  funny enough  many of them are full of broken glass. Perhaps LFL-smashing is this generation's Mailbox Baseball. * So they could be dangerous  especially if the glass comes into contact with the erotica and then cuts you as you are reaching for that copy of "Netscape Navigator for Dummies.
