  A2A. This started out as one of those charming  Pinterest-friendly ideas  but as a person who walks pretty much everywhere  I am starting to get tired of seeing these Little Free Libraries everywhere.Endemic to the kind of affluent urban enclaves neighborhoods which also loves to plaster around Neighborhood Watch signs and cutesy euphemistic placards telling folks to pick up their dog feces  these Little Free Libraries are like fucking weeds.Granted  they are very cute -- and a great place to dump your outdated software manuals  Scientology literature  crappy fad diet books and all other kinds of literary detritus.
