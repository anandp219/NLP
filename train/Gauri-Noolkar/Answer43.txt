  No aptitude-IQ-EQ test is going to vouch for a politician's integrity or intelligence. Power games bring out the worst (and best) in all  so trying to safeguard the public and the system from that with a few tests is going to be fruitless.Having said that  I do believe that MPs and MLAs should possess some basic credentials in order to call themselves MPs and MLAs. Education is so basic and mandatory a requirement that I won't waste any space on it. Ditto with declaration of assets and no criminal record.What they need to be tested at (and clear) is a 'work' test.
