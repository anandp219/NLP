That is largely because it is packed with people  events  failure and repetition of many daily tasks (due to inefficient systems and inadequate infrastructure)  infrastructural struggles  limited/inefficient technology  and an inherent lack of management understanding. We rarely get time to sit and plan our days  tasks and priorities consciously and systematically; most of the time  we are on the run  juggling everything on the way  mostly getting things done as and when they directly stare into our face and block out everything else.
