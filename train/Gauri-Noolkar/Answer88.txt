Aishwarya Rai looks pretty as usual  and her toned down  non-plastic-y version is refreshing as well. Other actors do justice to their roles  too.The movie is slightly long (but then  we are talking Ashutosh Gowarikar...) but it does not bore or make you glance into your watch. A simple  decent  tastefully made period film - boy  we do need more of those.Are you looking forward to watching Bajirao Mastani  by the way? It releases on 18th December.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...My most favourite hero ever!I can't wait!!
