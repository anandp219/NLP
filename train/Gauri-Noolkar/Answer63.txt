True  she had been in touch with her subject due to her profession. She was quite intelligent  well-read  with good language and writing skills. But she was not a genius.Also  she was 55. Which meant that she had spent most of her life without the technologies we youngsters so take for granted  and had to grow comfortable with them overnight. Which also meant that along with her PhD  she had work commitments and home commitments. Which also meant that she didn't have the advantage of energy  swiftness and flexibility we young students possess but are rarely aware of.She signed up anyway.
