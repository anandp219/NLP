I find myself  just like many find themselves  drawn to such people  for they ignite a never-ending fire in our minds  and feed it with their intelligence. Coupled with humility and firm grounding  this intelligence is impossible to resist.Yet  there are some downsides as well. If intelligence is not coveted  it is intimidating. Hell  even if it is  it can still be intimidating  at least in the initial stages. People who intimidate others with their intelligence  howsoever unintentionally  end up with relatively more difficulty in establishing emotionally close relationships sustainably.
