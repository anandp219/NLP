My picks - Dasbodh  Bhagwad Gita. (both unfinished)8. Classic Short Stories.A good short story is a tequila shot of the intricacies of human nature. The classic ones  though a bit wordy  are both exotic and familiar and stand the test of time. They are a quick read as well.My picks - stories by Gulzar  Saki  Somerset Maugham  O. Henry  Ruskin Bond. 9. Humour and Entertainment.A chuckle to a full dose of laughter  and you will not want anything else. My picks - The Corfu Trilogy  The Jeeves Omnibus  works of Pu La Deshpande.
