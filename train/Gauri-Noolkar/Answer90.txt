That means these women will think - a dangerous thing if you do not want your thoughts  principles and commands to be challenged. A society with a family structure which has so rigidly decided to have a say on even the most private aspects of its individuals' (women's) lives will never  never find compatibility with a concept which basically allows everyone to 'mind their own business'.In that sense  feminism also serves as a challenge to men's traditional roles in the Indian family. It strips off their dominance and power  but it opens up at least three avenues - of individualism  freedom of choice and sexual empowerment - for them.
