  Thousands have been fleeing Syria for five years now  because a civil war has been raging in the country since 2011. Since then  many rebel groups have been formed  and a brand new terrorist organisation has cut out a portion of Syria and joined it with a part of Iraq to form the shockingly brutal Islamic State. People  especially minorities  are fleeing the Islamic State as well.Explaining all the factors from scratch would make it a really long answer  so very briefly  the reasons for the Syrian civil war and the rise of the Islamic State span from the Sykes-Picot agreement signed almost a century ago  to government failures and sectarian conflicts  to even the chronic drought which occurred in 2010-11.
