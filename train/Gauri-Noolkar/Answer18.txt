That doesn't make news for most of the world though.Truth to tell  there is no one solution to the migrant crisis. Also  the whole situation is extremely complex and as a novice in the field  the more I dig in  the more it overwhelms me. I am sorry  I have no concrete solution.It is easy to take a position on whether European countries should accept the migrants  especially when you are rooted rock solid in your point of view. For instance  human rights activists have it crystal clear - they should be taken in and rehabilitated.
