  I am afraid Pune is not a very touristy city  but you will certainly have a good time here.You should definitely check out the Kelkar Museum  Shaniwar Wada  Camp  Sarasbaug  the University campus  and the old city  notably Tulshibaug if you like shopping as well. A walk down JM road and FC road will be great as well. If you like to party  Koregaon Park is the place.Staying at and around Deccan would help you. It is close to the centre of the city and is well connected to other areas. Safe as well.
