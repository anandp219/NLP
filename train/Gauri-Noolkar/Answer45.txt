  To help people  to show others they are smart  and a lot more. A lot of people write because they genuinely want to share. Each of us is a bundle of unique experiences  full of stories  and has something or the other to offer. Many of us like to. Just as we can express opinions  offer a piece or two of advice and narrate stories to people around us  we can also write it all.Many write because they are asked to  as well. People don't just like to express  they like to  need to  wish to learn as well.
