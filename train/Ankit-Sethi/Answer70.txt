For example  in his book  Film After Film: (Or  What Became of 21st Century Cinema? )  Village Voice critic J Hoberman collects his numerous review columns and commentaries published over the course of the 2000s and wonderfully relates them to the heightened events after 9/11 and the mindset of the post 9/11 American zeitgeist in both the general populace and the film industry. By prefixing fresh new commentaries before each older piece  a large part of the book turns into one long examination of the Bush and early Obama years and their reflection and impact on the popular films of the time.
