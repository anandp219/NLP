This linear range offered "anchors" our expectations of how we can describe a body to a single linear dimension when in reality the diversity of human beings should need more than a single reductive number to describe it. This suits the capitalist commodifying needs of Vogue and the fashion industry  which wants standardized sizes for a) optimal mass production  b) setup a linear spectrum of attractiveness pegged to this scale and c) induce aspirational anxieties that drives women to attempt to hoodwink genes and nature in the pursuit of going up a scale that is not necessarily the best way to measure a body in the first place.
