  There's a line from a later West Wing episode around the time Bartlet is running for a second term:You say that these numbers mean dial it down. I say they mean dial it up. You haven't gotten through. There are people you haven't persuaded yet. These number mean dial it up. Otherwise you're like the French radical  watching the crowd run by and saying  "There go my people. I must find out where they're going so I can lead them. "Bartlet is trying to strike a balance between kowtowing to populism and the status quo and advancing the public conversation in America towards his liberal ideas  which is the kind of progress he knows he needs to make to leave a lasting intellectual legacy as President.
