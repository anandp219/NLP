Put another way  "rape culture" conversations boil down to an ideological debate about how correct feminist thinkers are in diagnosing the causes of rape  while "rape epidemic" conversations are about the data and using to it to best characterize (or mischaracterize  depending on your skin in the game) the symptoms.In the context of the US reporting on India and other foreign countries  the common strain I can spot is that "epidemic" is meant to give the news piece an urgency and sensationalism that can seem clueless to people who've actually grown up and lived in that background being suddenly targeted for coverage.The US media has the power to culturally dominate and define what's news and what's not  on a global stage.
