Heidegger went on to say:"Consumption for the sake of consumption is the sole procedure that distinctively characterizes the history of a world that has become an unworld.... Being today means being replaceable." He also cited Rainer Marie Rilke's thoughts about America:Now is emerging from out of America pure undifferentiated things  mere things of appearance  sham articles.... A house in the American understanding  an American apple or an American vine has nothing in common with the house  the fruit  or the grape that had been adopted in the hopes and thoughts of our forefathersOne may note that these ideas are common even today among people of all ideological inclinations  even those who would balk at being associated with the proto-Nazism of Heidegger.
