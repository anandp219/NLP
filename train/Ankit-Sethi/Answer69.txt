Critics can frame the context around a particular actor's current film role based on his career arc in the past (eg. how Adam Sandler's early comedies inform his role in the stylish romantic drama Punch-Drunk Love). They can explain how a director's technique is evolving over time  what traditions he used to be enamored with in his early days (Wes Anderson and the French New Wave) and what new influences he seems to be channeling now (Stefan Zweig in Budapest Hotel) and how they're affecting his style.Critics can also connect a cinematic legacy with a historical legacy  cutting across different styles and personalities.
