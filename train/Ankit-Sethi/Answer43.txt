  A2AWith due respect to Stephanie Vardavas' answer  I find her strategies to be heavily contingent on a majority or even a plurality of one's friends having the sort of good tastes you're having trouble discovering currently. My experience has not been like that so I prefer a measure of independence in discovery.My advice would be to try and enter the cultural conversation going on online. Vibrant communities exist that are passionate about every genre of fiction you might be interested in. I'm a literary fiction person and I actually do prefer contemporary books to older classics  so I started out by reading up the recent Pulitzer and Booker winners  and discovering sites that review their works or comment upon them in some form.
