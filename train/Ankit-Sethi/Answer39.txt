  Journalism is not dead. And Buzzfeed is not  I repeat for emphasis  NOT crap.If you haven't taken a moment to scratch the surface and actually measure the quality of Buzzfeed's reporting for yourself  please take a moment now to do so.

Some big names from older generations of media have made their home at Buzzfeed and the site is giving them the space and platform to write great stories.See links here for more: American Journalism Review  CUNY Graduate School of Journalism - CUNY Graduate School of Journalism   Three lists about BuzzFeeds serious journalismThey have some ways to go still but it is clear that Buzzfeed's business model is actually working (=making money)  which makes it a rarity in the current media climate.
