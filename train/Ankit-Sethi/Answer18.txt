  All right  this thread seems a tad underserved.God & CapitalismUpstream Color by Shane Carruth - Mr. Carruth's sophomore effort is a shift from the circular time-loops of Primer to the elliptical visuals of mind-controlling worms and perilously blue orchids juxtaposed with the lives of two victims of a senseless ransacking of their lives  a trauma which connects as well as pulls them apart. To call it just an allegory of about higher powers and systems of economics would be unfair because it can be read as an allegory of depression or addiction  among many other possibilities.
