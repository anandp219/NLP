This is difficult as he is  in his words "a human starting gun." This is why he's losing sleep - his inability to come up with a strong  unique brand of leadership that can help affect change. His arc over the course of this episode contrasts neatly with the VP Hoynes' refusal to play ball with the White House on a tied ethanol vote  and helps highlights the relative incapacities of the President's office in taking a principled stand.In the final scene when they're on the phone  Bartlet expresses admiration for a past instance in which Hoynes spoke for an unpopular position on ethanol in Iowa  a position he re-asserts during the episode as the White House tries to get him to vote against his position to break the tie.Hoynes  still Presidential hopeful  is getting to sleep at night.
