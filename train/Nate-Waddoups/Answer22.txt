  Consider this article from the New Yorker in 2012:The Simple Truth About Gun Control - The New YorkerParticularly this part:At some point  we will become a gun-safe  and then a gun-sane  and finally a gun-free society. Its closer than you think. That is the sort of phrase that causes gun owners to believe - not entirely incorrectly - that the true purpose of gun control legislation is to confiscate everyone's firearms. So gun owners dig in their heels. So nothing changes.Background checks are a nice idea in theory  but writers like this guy make it clear that limiting criminals' access to firearms is just a step on the path to getting firearms out of everyone's hands.
