  It is not clear yet whether 3D printing will be a good career for anyone  anywhere  other than for those who hold patents on very significant printer technologies.Hardware: There are many companies competing to make fused-deposition-modeling printers  and all of that competition is keeping profit margins small. It is almost a commodity business.There are still some patents covering key aspects of powder-based printing  so the people/companies that hold those patents can charge a premium. However I'm told that the first wave of those patents are going to expire soon  after which we can expect a surge in competition in that area as well - with an accompanying drop in prices (good for consumers) and profit margins (not good for producers).So if you want to go into hardware your only chance of earning big money would be to come up with patents that advance the state-of-the-art.
