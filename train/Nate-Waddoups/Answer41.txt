  No  your employer does not get access to any other content on the device.Setting up an Exchange account can trigger increased security measures  such as more digits in your unlocking PIN  automatic locking after a short idle time  or enabling the Exchange admin to wipe the Exchange content (or even  in some cases  the whole devic). But those are the only kinds of side-effects. And you can always opt out if you aren't happy about it. If you are concerned about the content on the device  you should probably be using those extra security measures anyway.
