At the macro level  millions of years of evolution have brought us countless species  by producing (and selecting for) genes that mutate ever-so-slightly. Most mutations are harmful  but a few end up being beneficial  allowing their carries to reproduce more effectively than the competition. Some of those harmful mutations resulting in unviable offspring (perhaps another candidate for "worst product of evolution")  others produce tumors that lead to death at an arbitrary age.At the micro level  most individuals are born cancer-free  but mutations that accumulate over time eventually give rise to a cancer cell.
