  It will certainly help the industry to have the legal issues resolved. But if that were to happen tomorrow  we would still have a couple more obstacles (in addition to batteries) preventing widespread adoption.In order to fly unsupervised in arbitrary environments  drones need to be able to detect and avoid obstacles. Detection is the hard part. We either need better sensor technology  or better software to interpret the output of existing sensors. For example  3D sensors like Microsoft's Kinect can do a great job of mapping an environment  but they are still large  heavy  and power-hungry  and their range is limited.
