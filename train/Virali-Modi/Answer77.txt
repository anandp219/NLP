  I met my current partner through shaadi.com. Weirdly enough  he wasn't using his profile when he found me  his dad was. It turned out that his father saw me  called his son over  and told him to talk to me. According to my boyfriend  his dad said that I was pretty  intelligent (based off of my description)  and I seemed like a cool person.Well  he expressed and interest in me  but I declined him because of superficial reasons; his pictures on the website were not at all attractive  plus he stays in Africa.
