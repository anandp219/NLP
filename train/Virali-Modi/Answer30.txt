  It doesn't matter if you're serious about your boyfriend or not  you're in a relationship and infidelity shouldn't be the answer to your question. I'm sure you wouldn't like it if your boyfriend cheated on you  no matter how horny he was.Coming to the part about your lonliness  go to the movies  read a book  or binge watch a TV series. I think being alone can be truly beautiful  you have the time to discover yourself both emotionally and physically. Take advantage of that.You're horny  masturbate.
