  Do you know what you should've done when she was giving you hints? I think you should've asked her if she liked you and was indicating a relationship  if she would've said yes  you could have told her exactly what you told us (that you had prior commitments). You could've asked her to wait  and none of this would've happened. Usually  the biggest mistakes we make are all communication related. I'm not trying to discourage you by saying this  but I want you to understand this for your future.Look  she's happy with her boyfriend and you're happy for her  even though you're miserable.
