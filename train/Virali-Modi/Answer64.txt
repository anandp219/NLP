Dhyaan also heard about all the shunning and rumors  he took action on it  but silently.He would come sit next to me on the sofa  hold my hand  and he'd kiss my cheek  in front of his whole family. He'd talk to me about his day  and then we'd go outside for a walk  across the street and just sit on the benches and relax in the cold night air. Sometimes we'd go out to his backyard and we'd play with his dog  Milo. He made it known to his family that their words made no difference to him  he was proud to have me (and vice versa)  and he loved me.Coming to his parents; the wedding was a very stressful time for them  there was a huge water and electricity problem  on top of that almost everyone got sick with a virus  which turned out to be Typhoid (but thankfully we all had our vaccinations for Typhoid  but still managed to get a cold and fever)  the bride was in bad shape  and as you can imagine  some members of the family were pinpointing his parents about me.
