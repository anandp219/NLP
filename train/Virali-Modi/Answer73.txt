They bought two bottles of red wine and two large bottles of beer.Suddenly  one of my friends (Amy) launches herself at the wine and demands everyone to pour her some. My friend (Dex)  who is a self-proclaimed bartender (even though he sucks) poured all the girls (except me and one other friend (Erica) ) somewhat equal amounts of wine. The boys divided the beers into glasses and everyone started drinking. Suddenly  Amy finishes her glass and asks for more; since she's a light weight  I told her to enjoy the wine with sips  and not to down it immediately  otherwise she'll definitely get drunk.
