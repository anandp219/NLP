  A couple of weeks ago I had gone out partying for my birthday (it was an early celebration). Well  my friends and one of my cool uncles had come along (my mom didn't come). We went out to a lounge and he was forcing me to drink (because it was my birthday and according to him  I should be sloshed). I told him to call my mom to tell her that I'll be drinking (the place was loud and wasn't extremely accessible for me to leave to make the call). He told me not to worry because he'd handle it. Guess what immature  stupid Virali did?
