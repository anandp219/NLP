What made it even more difficult is the fact that I didn't know Hindi (a widely spoken language)  I could only understand it. The only languages I knew were English and Gujarati (my mother tongue).On top of that  when we landed in Mumbai  the next day  we took a train to Delhi for an ayurvedic treatment. This treatment required my mom and I to stay there for a month (coincidentally  my birthday month). I was given digusting medicines to drink and pills to swallow  oil massages in which I couldn't shower for a couple of days  and head massages which left my hair oily and gross looking.
