You aren't mentally prepared to have someone in your life  according to me. Why do I say this? Because you haven't embraced yourself  you haven't embraced the time alone you have with yourself  and you don't seem to love yourself. How can you love someone else if you don't love who you are? I'm sorry that was harsh  but for me  I need someone who is comfortable in their own skin  in any situation. I need someone who loves who they are. That's how I know they'll be able to love me.My mom always told me one thing  "The wrong friends can ruin you."
