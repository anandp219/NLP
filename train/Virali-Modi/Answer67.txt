  When I was young  I wanted to be famous; I didn't care how  but I wanted to be famous. There really wasn't a reason for it  except that it seemed really cool! A couple of years later  I was approached by a teacher from Barbizon Modeling and Acting school  and they encouraged me to pursue modeling and acting because I had a unique face. I suppose it was just a marketing tactic  but I fell for it. I went ahead and paid the fees for the two month course and received lessons on how to apply makeup  style hair  how to behave  and how to pose in front of a camera.Due to the courses  the participants of the course had an opportunity to meet scouts; I met a scout and I got selected for a soda ad.
