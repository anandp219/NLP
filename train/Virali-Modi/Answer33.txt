  1. When applying mascara to my bottom lashes  I make sure I use the mascara wand to "stamp" my lower lashline so it looks like I used some eyeliner. This trick helps me save time and it gives definition to my lower lashline without using another product.2. If I don't have the blush color I want  I use a lipstick of the same color and apply it to my cheeks like a cream blush. This gives me a luminous finish without having to use an illuminator on my cheeks  plus I can use drugstore lipsticks to achieve the perfect cheek color without spending an excessive amount of money.3.
