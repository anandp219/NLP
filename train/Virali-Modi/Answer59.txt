After therapy  I realized what kind of positive effect it had on me. I had improvements. My muscles and genuine movements had improved. I don't know if this is coincidence or if it's actually because I stopped thinking about myself and my legs.Why am I telling you this? Well  I think you should stop thinking about the future. Everyone has some mishaps in their life  whether it be because of education or because of money. You cannot keep thinking about that specific mishap and how it might affect your future; because it will affect your future  but for the better.
