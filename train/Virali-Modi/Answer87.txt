  I moved to India in 2008 for more treatment and options for my health. If you don't know what happened to me  I suggest you read: Virali Modi's answer to What does it feel like to survive death?.In 2008  I weighed 75kgs  I was paralyzed from my chest down. I had some movement in my arms  but they weren't strong enough for me to be completely independent. My mom and I moved to India  leaving my father behind in America (so he could provide financial stability). It was incredibly difficult leaving behind the United States and of course my father.
