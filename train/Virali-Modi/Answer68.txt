I was given a date to sign the contract. As you can imagine  I was ecstatic. When the day came to sign the contract  I was in the hospital fighting for my life. I'm sure everyone knows what happened next. I became wheelchair bound and I was paralyzed from the neck down.At that moment  I lost all hope that I'd ever be famous. I didn't think I'd do anything worthwhile in my life. After a couple of years  I started working on my confidence. Gradually  I became so confident that I decided to try my luck in modeling and acting.
