 Xu BeixiI once read a remark about puppies- all they have to do is roll over, wag their tails, and we succuumb to their charms.And it got me wondering- I think it can be boiled down to this:offer love. Lots of it. Don't be stingy, dole it out like marmalade, not dabble it on like caviar (to inverse Nol Coward's expression on wit).be kind. Don't hurt others and don't carry any malice in your words or actions.be trusting. That's the equivalent of rolling over; exposing your belly is being vulnerable and open.be comfortable in your own skin. Puppies never pretend to be anything other than what they are.be playful- keep a lively spirit and a livelier mind."If A is success in life, then A equals x plus y plus z. Work is x; y is play; and z is keeping your mouth shut." Albert Einstein, Observer, Jan. 15, 1950. Or as the puppy does, go about wagging your tail instead of wagging your tongues and fingers.It also helps to be fuzzy and adorable, but in lieu of that, you can remember people's names and birthdays; improve your awareness of social situations, hire a body language coach or speech therapist, dress sharper; and most importantly, be someone of value. We, being the self-centred creatures that we are, ultimately like those who provide something of value to us. So if you can accomplish the final task, the demand for your presence will never cease.
