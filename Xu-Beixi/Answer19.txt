 Xu BeixiPardon me, you may be sincere but you're also invoking a Red herring. "Instead" (falsely) implies that we cannot do both, have movements that cater to both groups and their specific needs. As had been pointed out, the latter has been presented positively in the media, and with a great deal of sympathy. But I do believe that it is because of these facts:there are far more obese people in America than there are burn victimsthere is widespread shaming of the obese, but not burn victimsthere is a notion that obesity is self-induced and deserved; this does not hold true for those with birth defects and deformities, and especially burn victims (hence the term "victim")there is no one protesting the media's promotion of the latter, but plenty of people shaming the former:C'mon, lady. No need to point fingers.That said, on fat shaming and the resulting equal and opposite reaction- I honestly feel the issue isn't the obesity- that's merely the symptom of a bigger disease. The fundamental problem isn't people, who are by and large the same the world over in any given population. Plus, if you look at photos of Americans taken in the 1970s, hardly anyone was overweight, much less obese. (Americans 1970s - Google Search) They didn't abruptly, magically become "lazy" or "greedy" in a couple of generations.The signal to the noise is the way food and beverage industries in America are run and regulated, the distribution of wealth, the existence of Food deserts, the lack of availability of healthy and nutritious food, government policy, prevalence of 'junk food', and perhaps most importantly- the habits children are being introduced to. You can shame the obese all you want; it will just make a lot of people feel terrible and these underlying problems will unfortunately still exist.
