 Xu BeixiNatural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype; it is a key mechanism of evolution. -Natural selectionNo. Even if it were real, the friendzone relies on the nice guy/girl trope, otherwise formally defined as "an informal term for a teenage or adult (fe)male who is gentle, compassionate, sensitive and/or vulnerable.[1]" If these traits are disfavoured, they will not be allowed to reproduce and survive. The fact that such traits are fairly common disproves it by direct evidence, as well as the fact that most people pair up and reproduce. That our population looms at 7.3 billion bears testament to that. If you do wish to invoke a scientific concept, Assortative mating is likely the one you're looking for. Or, "a mating pattern and a form of sexual selection in which individuals with similar genotypes and/or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern." In short, people who are similar tend to match up together (e.g. age, body size, good looks, etc.). I think many people make the understandable mistake of chasing after someone more objectively desirable rather than find someone who matches on their characteristics, leading to much heartache.
