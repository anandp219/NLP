 Xu BeixiSince the rest have been covered, and your comments points to the informal definition, or "a woman's sudden need to have a child" (taken from urbandictionary), that's what we'll explore today. I would say the evidence points to this being more sociological than biological, and men are most certainly not exempt (please see: A Biological Clock for Guys? for a deeper enquiry). First, we know for a fact that more and more modern couples are Childless and Loving It, without any urge to reproduce (and are statistically happier for it). We also know that the desire to produce children is actually influenced by a whole range of factors, of which biology does play a role- just not one large enough to define it solely by:Baby Fever Is a Real Emotion, and Men Get It Too | TIME.comAfter sorting the data, according to Gary Brase, they found that the sociocultural view was not a great predictor of how strongly people felt a desire to have children.The byproduct view holds that people want to have children to fulfill an urge to nurture. But the Brases found that this theory didnt tell the whole story either.Finally, the Brases trained their lens on the adaptationist view, which theorizes that baby fever is an emotional signal that subconsciously hints to the brain that it might be a good time to have a baby. When testing out this hypothesis, the Brases found that positive exposure to babies (ones that coo and smile and smell nice) made people want to have kids, while negative exposure (crying, stinky infants) made people shy away from the idea of parenthood. Another factor they considered involved the inevitable trade-offs involved in having children  less time, less money and less freedom to do what you want, when you want.Granted, there are limitations to the research, but I think it is enough to indicate that we have not so much a biological clock when it comes to children, but more of a socio-biological one.Thanks, Bhargav. :)
