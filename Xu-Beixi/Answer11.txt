 Xu Beixidemonizedimnz/portray as wicked and threatening.The simplest answer is because he is unfortunately wicked (i.e. morally wrong) and threatening to the public. He placed money above the price of human life and health [1], and that to the vast majority of humanity is inexcusable.However, I do think he's being singled out for a few reasons:his visibility- he's on social media, pulling stunts that make him look obnoxious:he's the figurehead of Turing Pharmaceuticals, though I don't think he was the only one responsible for the price hike and acquisition of patentsto people, he's the epitome of corporate greed, even though he most certainly is not the only person engaging in such practicesthe way the internet is structured: it's easy to follow his story and spread the news, as well as images of his presumably unfettered douchebaggeryIn short, he made himself easy to hate figurehead and people reacted accordingly. Much like the dentist who shot Cecil, however, I don't see him remaining in public consciousness as more than a footnote once this scandal blows over. That, and he has reacted accordingly: Turing to cut pricing for Daraprim amid backlash.Although all news outlets were not so kind: Martin Shkreli Lowers Drug Price, Is Still an Asshole[1] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubm..., http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseas...
