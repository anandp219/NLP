 Xu BeixiAnna Kashfi, or Joan O'Callaghan, was such a lady.en.wikipedia.orgShe was born to British parents, but claimed to be have one or both Indian parents at different points in life (by writing two Indian names on her marriage certificate, and claiming to have an Indian father towards the end).By the age of 22 Joan O'Callaghan had transformed herself into the exotic ethnic "Indian" model and actress Anna Kashfi, using a name invented by her and Glyn Mortimer, the head of a London modeling agency.[1]The matter of Kashfi's ethnic heritage has remained in question. Both her English-born parents maintained she was their biological daughter, born, her father told Parade magazine in 1959, "to my wife in 1934 when I was employed by the Bengal-Nagupur railway as a station master". Parade stated that its investigation determined that "her baptismal certificate bears this out" and furthermore stated that she had a brother, Bosco Brian Patrick O'Callaghan, who was then attending a technical college in Cardiff.[1]However, upon her 1957 marriage to Marlon Brando a year after adopting her stage name, Kashfi failed to list either on her marriage license, instead stating her real father was one Devi Kashfi and biological mother named Selma Ghose. In an October 14, 1957, wedding day interview with the The New York Times (entitled "Kashfi Still Enigma: License Does Not List Welsh Couple As Parents"), a friend of the bride was quoted as stating that Kashfi's purported Indian father had died six weeks before the ceremony.[3]The most surprising thing was how this played out quite similarly in some ways, from their inability to stick to a consistent story, convenient absences of purported parents, attempting to look the part, distancing themselves from their biological parents, and of course, not being able the answer the question of their heritage directly. I don't think they went very "far", however, and certainly never did alter their facial features in their ruse.
