 Xu BeixiOh dear! I'm really sorry this happened at such a bad time. Given the doctor's examination and prescription, plus the redness and swelling, it is probably an eyelid inflammation. That said, it may not have been the threading, common causes include allergies and infections. It could have been anything- eye makeup, contact lens wear, swimming in contact lenses, etc.I'm afraid there's not much you can do, other than taking your medication. You can ask your doctor about taking an anti-histamine or decongestant on top of the antibiotics (if there isn't one already) to reduce the inflammation, since you need to prepare for the ball (please see: Antihistamines: Understanding Your OTC Options). They are readily available in your local mall pharmacies, too. That said, you may wish to take an allergen test (please see: Allergy Testing | About Allergy Test | ACAAI), and take more caution with items that go in or near your eyes, or like Viola says, using a cold compress. I know it's hard, but you should consider going if it means a lot to you and since the issue is merely cosmetic. Usually, however, the swelling goes down as quickly as it flares up. Get some sleep, don't rub them, and use the medication given to you. There's still time!Thanks for the A2A, Viola!More: Eye Swelling - Causes, Symptoms & Treatment for Eye Swelling
