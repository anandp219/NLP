 Xu Beixi"[1]"Translation: Na Qi is to garner Qi, taking the essence of the universe (the heavens, the earth, and all things) into one's own body.And specifically in TCM: "" [2]Translation: A medical syndrome. The Kidney is the root of Qi, and rules over Na Qi. When the Kidney Qi is weak, the Qi does not return to the Yuan and this is called Shen Bu Na Qi. (Taken from the book below).The problem with direct translations is that medical terms can be very specific, and there may not be an English equivalent of concepts like Qi (which leads some to conclude it doesn't exist), or even Kidney (which I've been taught doesn't refer to the actual kidney, but the kidney system that governs a great deal of other bodily functions, processes, and even the hair- making things all the more confusing). If you would like a more in-depth study, it is recommended to pick up the basics of TCM, which is probably best learnt in Mandarin. Nonetheless, a great English starter compilation can be: Introduction to TCM - TCM Basics[1] ""[2] _Good luck!
