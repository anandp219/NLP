 Xu BeixiWell, your main question and comments are asking something quite dissimilar.It's only racist when you're specifically rejecting them for being of a certain race, and considering their race superior/inferior on top of that. Conversely, being attracted to a race doesn't mean you're not racist against them- just think of all the antebellum white slaveowners who kept black women as mistresses and treated them as chattel simultaneously. Same concept for having "friends of all colors". That said, the world is vast. It would be perhaps short-sighted to say, "I'm not attracted to X race" just because it hasn't happened yet. There are hundreds of millions of Chinese men, how do you know for certain you'll never find a single one appealing?I do think your response was more polite than those men deserved, because they're the ones being childish and immature by calling someone who rejected them "racist" when there was apparently no evidence to point to the case. Tl;dr: Not racist, but likely short-sighted.
