 Xu BeixiFrom 7 Characteristics of Emotionally Strong People:Emotionally strong people ...are less discouraged by setbacks and disappointments.are more adaptable to change.are able to recognize and express their needs.focus on getting around a hurdle rather than on the hurdle itself.can learn from mistakes and criticism.tend to see the larger perspective in a challenging situation.are able to recover more quickly from emotional wounds such as failure or rejection.I think this less of a gender issue than a maturity issue. It depends less on the gender, and more on the individual and their circumstances. That said, it has been reported than men mature later, both neurologically [1] [2] and socially [2]:The NIH/NIMH study, entitled "Sexual dimorphism of brain developmental trajectories during childhood and adolescence," is reprinted by permission of Elsevier from the journal NeuroImage, volume 36, number 4, pages 1065-1073, July 15 2007.In the figure below, from the NIH study, shows trajectories of brain development in girls (red line) and boys (blue line), with 95% confidence intervals above and below each line. The arrow indicates the inflection point, roughly the halfway point in brain development. Girls reach the inflection point just before age 11 years; boys do not reach the inflection point until just before age 15 years. A young woman reaches full maturity, in terms of brain development, between 21 and 22 years of age. A young man does not reach full maturity, in terms of brain development, until nearly 30 years of age.[1] Gender Differences in the Sequence of Brain Development[2] Men Mature After Women  11 Years After, To Be Exact  A British Study Reveals
