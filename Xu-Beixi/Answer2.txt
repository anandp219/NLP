 Xu Beixies and no.Yes, it is an endorsement in that "alternative medicine" produced results in the eyes of the public and has now made headlines. However, this has been going on for quite a while under the radar- there is an avalanche of TCM studies in Pubmed alone [1]. The Nobel merely catapulted it into the general public's consciousness. Her research wasn't a mystery before [2]; people who aren't in medical research or beleaguered graduate students just weren't aware of it.No, because it endorsed one TCM herb; a swallow does not a summer make. Also, Nobels are awarded for heavily political reasons as well, which may detract from its perceived significance. I'm not sure everyone will know or care about this, either. Can most of us name the Nobel winners of last year? Or the year before? News comes and goes in today's instantaneous world, and there's no guarantee that others will see it as an endorsement, or even remember it in time to come. As much as we don't wish it to be, most scientists and their work eventually become a minuscule historical footnote, to be quickly scribbled down on a test paper. (But our brains will probably remember Kim Kardashian forever.)Personally, I think we should wait and see what happens- I don't see it as a stamp of approval on TCM exactly, more of a ringing endorsement of Dr. Tu's work and effort. :) Thanks for the A2A, Sunny. [1] Page on www.ncbi.nlm.National Institutes of Health (NIH)/pubmed/?term=tcmNB: My final year research project was a literature review to compile said scientifically tested pharmacological effects of TCM herbs on the human body. And it had to be limited to smooth muscle, due to the aforementioned avalanche.
