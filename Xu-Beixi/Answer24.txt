 Xu BeixiFirst, I think you may have these two definitions mixed up:Economic value is a measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an economic agent.Market value or OMV (Open Market Valuation) is the price at which an asset would trade in a competitive auction setting. Economic value has to exceed market value, thus the customer is compelled to part with their money. Those (priceless) qualities are imbued with economic value, but low market value when alone. Many acts of kindness are also not necessarily seen or carried out in an economic context.That said, there are some decent earning jobs where such traits pay off-Healthcare jobs (physiotherapist, nurse, radiologist, medical technologist, psychologist, etc.)Or even a professional huggerSee: Would you pay $60 to be snuggled?Counselor, Social WorkerCoach, MasseuseService staffetc. The thing to note is, they are mostly part and parcel of a larger whole, a larger service. Since compassion, love and understanding are able to be provided by nearly anyone without any training, nor does it carry very much risk in general, it tends to not pay by itself. Otherwise, babies and animals will also need to be paid overtime, and figuring out their taxes will be tough. In an interesting twist, it is possibly the least fulfilling aspects of life that pay the best. The reasons are exactly the opposite; not everyone is willing and able to do so, and the risks are immense, barriers to entry are high, and so forth.As a researcher once cleverly quipped, "if you want money, go into the illegal weapons trade." (He then laughs, maybe a little bitterly, and swivels about in his chair.)
