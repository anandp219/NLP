 Xu BeixiWhen you feel you're ready to take on the responsibility of it.While it is a romantic and lovely concept to think all generations of humanity don't really know what they're doing and just making it up as they go along, it's not actually true. If something's important to you, you can choose to determine if you are mature enough to handle the potential consequences and educate yourself regarding the concept. There is a plethora of reliable library resources for you to keep safe and date the way you wish, whilst taking care of the other party. In my local library, they're usually in the 370 non-fiction section.There are also a few questions you may wish to ask yourself:how much time and emotional energy do I have to do this with?what are some exit strategies if things go wrong (and they can)?what type of love or relationship am I looking for?what do I want in a partner and what can I do for them?what do I know about myself, since the relationship with your dating partner can reflect the one you have with yourself?and many more- what's important to you? What are your personal limits and priorities?Thanks for the A2A, Anon. As someone who started dating relatively late in life, I do recommend going in with eyes open and homework done. Take care and good luck!
