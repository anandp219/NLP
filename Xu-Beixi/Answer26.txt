 Xu BeixiI'm one of those people who only touches 75% alcohol... for sterilizing.It's not a mystery; some people savour certain foods that others find unpalatable, if not downright repulsive. It's culture, biology, and your early experience all rolled into one- and even gender or choice of profession, as well as your age. A Pubmed study has found:Overall, students found alcohol-related activities more enjoyable than alcohol-free activities, and drinking quantity was positively related to enjoyment. However, alcohol-free activities such as watching movies, going to the theater or museums, going to bars or parties, hanging out with friends, eating at restaurants, and engaging in creative activity were generally as enjoyable as drinking. Alcohol-free activities that included peers or dates were more enjoyable than solitary activities. Men were less likely to engage in alcohol-free activities that included peers and reported less enjoyment related to alcohol-free activities than did women.Alcohol-related and alcohol-free activity participation and enjoyment among college students: a behavioral theories of choice analysis.So we're actually in the minority here. For me, I don't really like the taste (bitter! gah!), don't like the effects (sleepy, slurrly, overly-affectionate), and don't like the pricing (wallet lays limply on side). That being said, my partner keeps this magnet in his office. I'm still waiting to see if it's true.Or if you just think you're being smarter. ;)
