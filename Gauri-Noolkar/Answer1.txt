 Gauri NoolkarIshita Roy and Bala Senthil Kumar have given great answers, but I cannot resist answering even though my answer is on similar lines.In a single word, yes. Feminism directly challenges traditional family roles of women in the Indian society. It stands for everything family roles do not - individualism, independence, equality, self-responsibility, sexual empowerment to begin with - and directly contradicts what young girls and women are taught and generally expected to be.Feminism is a threat because it 'allow's women to simply use their brains. That means these women will think - a dangerous thing if you do not want your thoughts, principles and commands to be challenged. A society with a family structure which has so rigidly decided to have a say on even the most private aspects of its individuals' (women's) lives will never, never find compatibility with a concept which basically allows everyone to 'mind their own business'.In that sense, feminism also serves as a challenge to men's traditional roles in the Indian family. It strips off their dominance and power, but it opens up at least three avenues - of individualism, freedom of choice and sexual empowerment - for them. I realise men have traditionally experienced all three more than women historically, but they have been only relatively better off, and have had their share of issues as well.
