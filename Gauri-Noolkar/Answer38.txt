 Gauri NoolkarThe principle claim of the opposition is that there is more fiction than fact in Babasaheb Purandare's rendition of the life of Shivaji, though there are enough signs which show an anti-Brahmin element (Babasaheb Purandare is a Brahmin) in the whole issue. Opposing groups have also claimed that Shivaji and his mother Jijabai have been maligned, albeit subtly in Purandare's work. These groups, especially the Sambhaji Brigade, seem to have grown to consider themselves as the de facto protectors and promoters of Shivaji's work and Maratha history. Sambhaji Brigade also blames Babasaheb Purandare for causing confusion over Shivaji's birth date. It is interesting to note that the Sambhaji Brigade has always tried to downplay the role of Dadoji Konddeo (a Brahmin) in the education and grooming of Shivaji, and that of Sant Ramdas (also a Brahmin) who was hailed as Shivaji's political guru - and both have been featured favourably in Babasaheb Purandare's work. The removal of Dadoji Konddeo's statue from Lal Mahal, Pune (where Shivaji grew up) sometime around 2010 by them is an example of the intensity of their opposition. They are also openly and vocally anti-Brahmin in other issues and on the Internet. Perhaps the fact that one of the most eminent historians to document and popularize Shivaji's life and work happens to be a Brahmin might be infuriating them.
