 Gauri NoolkarIt is indeed a noble thought to teach and inspire children to leave behind an extraordinary footprint on the sands of time. The tricky part is making sure the thought is conveyed and received in its purest form.My dream... your dream?As a sensible, mature parent perhaps the most difficult thing to do is to ensure that you don't entangle your dreams with theirs. This is different from inculcating your values in them, or sharing your ideas and goals of life with them. There is a very thin line between inspiring and pressurizing your children to achieve the extraordinary. Papa don't preach...Preachy parents are instantly tuned out by most kids. Sure, they will 'yessir!' you, but deep down, they will know that they are doing things because you said so. It is extremely tricky to impart values without sounding preachy, and balancing that act is vital.Greatness begins at home.No, you don't have to be the richest, most intelligent, most powerful guy on earth for your children to find you extraordinary. They will find you extraordinary when you actually personify values and ideas which are unique and path breaking. These values and ideas need not rock humanity, but by making positive, meaningful differences in the lives of individuals around you, one at a time, you can set examples for your kids to observe and learn from.If you can manage these three points decently enough, the chances that your children will grow up with a strong but balanced combination of responsibility, ambition and character increase considerably. It is vital that your dreams are not levied upon them, and that they always, always have the option of not being obliged to leave back a legacy, your love for them remaining unaffected. It is also vital that you do not lose sight of their humanness while inspiring them to be extraordinary. Children, after all, they say, are not a tree to be grown. They are a fire to be lit and kindled. Light and nurture them.
