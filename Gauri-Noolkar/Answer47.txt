 Gauri NoolkarLet's start with what polymath means. Copying word-to-word from Wikipedia - A polymath is a person whose expertise spans a significant number of different subject areas; such a person is known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems.Phrases to note - "a significant number" (not all)"different subject areas" (not all)" draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems" (apply, not just 'know')A polymath is, by popular understanding, considered to be someone who is 'good at everything'. By 'good', people mostly mean 'fully informed'. Just as someone who can solve math problems at a fast speed, know a large number of complex and long words, and remember a lot of information is considered to be 'intelligent', a polymath is usually considered to be as someone who 'knows everything'.The meaning of polymath shows that such is not the case. The meaning also strongly suggests that there is no one framework which defines a polymath - two polymaths can have expertise in a large number of areas which are mutually exclusive of each other. In other words, you can be a polymath and still not comprehend a word of what the other is saying. While having varied interests is a good start, having too many of them is going to take you nowhere. You are right, there is too much out there to master, and it is not possible. I will go ahead and say it is not necessary either. Being a polymath is not about 'scratching the surface' of as many fields as possible; it is more about having serious, profound knowledge in a few fields and the skill to apply it efficiently in solving problems. Being a polymath was never easy, and it will never be. As such, it is a futile goal, because there is no 'ultimate polymath'. However, the process of working towards it and successfully applying the gains in your day-to-day life make it worth pursuing, more than actually focusing on achieving it.
