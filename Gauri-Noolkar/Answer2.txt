 Gauri NoolkarThe principal reason for widespread anaemia among Indian girls is poor dietary habits. Girls naturally need more iron, and it is important that they take active efforts to increase and maintain their haemoglobin levels. An effective diet is vital in doing so.A large portion of the Indian population is vegetarian, which means they do not eat meat, fish and eggs, which are rich in iron and proteins. While vegetarian diet too can be iron and protein rich, there is little to no effort taken in including the relevant foodstuffs in daily diet. Anaemia is more common among rural girls than urban ones, and one important reason is socio-cultural discrimination. Even today, girls are neglected in the face of their male siblings; their diet and nutrition, just like their education, assume secondary status in a typical rural Indian household. The health of young married women, pregnant women, and young mothers is also not given priority, especially if they do not produce male heirs. This is not immediately obvious, especially to urban observers, but a very important obstacle in tackling anaemia among Indian women.
