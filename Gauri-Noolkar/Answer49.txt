No, this has nothing to do with judging the author, his efforts, or the topic handled; it is more about me, as a consumer, being skeptical of the price being commensurate with my consumption of the book. I devour books (or at least, used to), and for quite a few years, I read 100+ books annually. The joy I got from them was priceless, but I wasn't fully convinced of paying a hefty amount for a few days (or hours) of reading. That's why, I borrowed. I borrowed from individuals, teachers, friends, other acquaintances - just anybody who was ready to lend it. I did not have access to Internet throughout my childhood, and I didn't know about Torrent till about a few years ago. Plus, I do not read e-books, hence I do not face the problem you do, but I know where it is coming from.I am assuming you truly cannot afford most books you download. I would suggest you the same - borrow from wherever you can. Also, whenever someone offers you a present, ask for cash, and spend it on a non-pirated copy. E-books are not as expensive as actual books; do keep a lookout for sales and discounts on websites which sell them (they give discounts on cheap books as well). The key is to spend on an original every time you can. At times when you cannot buy, borrow, ask, rent, but desperately need the book, then you have no choice, but to use what is available. Yet, you would feel a lot less guilty if you knew you had exhausted every single option you could think of.
