 Gauri NoolkarThe questions sounds easy at the onset, but the details underline its intricacy. I, for one, am not exactly sure what you wish to learn; on one hand, you seek a clear take on, or the perception of, the technical aspects on poetry, and on the other, you wish to know one's personal understanding. If I take former as your question, then really, I have no answer. I have never formally studied poetry (what we did at school is neither relevant nor useful) and I have never pushed myself to do so either. In fact, I rarely, if ever, read poetry as I have little patience, and hence, I am not the right person to comment on structures, syllables, metre, and the like.However, if you are simply looking to understand one's (my) personal understanding of a poem, I can offer an insight.A poem is an experience documented in a compact, brief yet creative manner, in which a human mind automatically seeks and finds a rhythmic pattern.Note, this is my personal understanding, not a definition. While 'compact' and 'brief' are important, the emphasis is ultimately on the automation in seeking and finding a rhythmic pattern. I have no scientific proof and no reading on this, but I believe the human mind looks for patterns and rhythm, and a poem is a medium through which one can express an experience, no matter how ordinary or extraordinary, while catering to this search. The key to a good poem lies not in an extensively pumped up vocabulary, but in the richness of the experience. The richness of the experience lies not in the experience, but in the perception of the one experiencing it. In somewhat day-to-day terms, it is like being able to watch and narrate an average (or below average) movie in High Definition, all the while maintaining a compact frame of mind.Again, this is no definition. Anything that does not fit into this understanding, no matter how critically acclaimed, does not constitute a poem for me. I doubt if this would be useful, but I hope it opened a window.
