 Gauri NoolkarThe best way to answer this is through the process of elimination.Because I cannot talk.Well, I can, but for me to open up my heart to you verbally, I need to know you, really like you (and vice versa) and you need to be a really good listener. I am an introvert, and very sensitive to what responses I get. I also take time to open up; people typically respond with their experiences when I narrate mine, and that turns me off. I expect you to get involved in what I am telling, just as I get involved in what you tell, and if that doesn't happen consistently, I cease to express.These aren't qualities to have if you want to speak to a group or to a new person.Because I am not artistic.Yes, I do play the keyboard a bit, and dance a bit, and embroider a bit. No, I don't sing. I like arts of all kinds, but they take too much effort to master or even do quite well at, and all the slogging takes the focus off expression. Because I cannot bottle up.I am not among those who can keep things on their minds and their lips sealed tight. I need to express. Pregnant silences can kill me, and I need to pour out whatever's on my mind, however silly or inappropriate it may be.Also, I cannot - will not - physically fight, destroy property, or engage in any violent act to get a point across, no matter how pertinent it is.I write to express. As simple as that.
