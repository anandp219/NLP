 Gauri Noolkar"at least on Independence Day"? I wonder what that is supposed to mean. Do you mean to imply that we should put up a mask to "save face" on a day that is a landmark in our history?Our advertisements do not showcase dark-skinned Indians because, face it, that's not what we want to see. We - yes, all of us - are so programmed to expect performers and models, especially those on TV, to be 'good looking', that anyone who does not fit that criteria is instantly viewed with a raised eyebrow.Yes, there are caveats.It is true that Indians, largely, the young generation, has begun to slowly overcome the "white is beautiful" mindset. Darker skin is gaining some footage, and the value associated with defining and accepting beauty beyond skin colour is on the rise. However, the mainstream definition of beauty is yet to change, and it still equates good looks with fair skin.It is equally true that the society is more and more accepting of realism in various media, and that acceptance also extends to those working in it. However, the first instinct is always to spot the physical beauty of the model/actor/celebrity in question, and then, by conscious understanding, we mould our thinking to accept the person as he/she appears, and recognize that alternative definitions of beauty exist. Commercial companies are not drivers of social change; they can only choose to be, and any that does so would be an exception, not the rule. The intention behind advertising is to make sure that their product appeals to the mainstream, i.e. the majority of the population, and hence, whatever is good for them is good for the company's product. Companies are genuinely not interested in sacrificing the mainstream profit-generating majority for a sliver of offbeat, liberal, intellectual thinkers. At the very least, they are quite clear and frank about it. Better than indulging in lies and hypocrisy by showcasing dark skin on a national holiday.
