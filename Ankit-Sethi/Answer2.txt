 Ankit SethiNote: There are assumptions in your question that can be challenged, but I won't since I feel that they aren't consequential enough to be attacked.Two reasons:1. The woman who are "downtrodden" have less time, resources and power to make a presence for themselves in the news and popular media due to systemic historical inequalities, and so you hear and read less about their lives and their work. This is almost tautological. From here, it also proceeds that enacting legislative changes or plotting similar projects aimed to have broad influence on society are many orders of magnitude harder for them.2. A feminism practiced without taking cognizance of the varied intersecting identities (of race, class, gender, sexuality etc) held by an individual -- each affecting an individual's place in social hierarchies of power -- is hobbled by blinkered views of what issues are "truly" important and pressing. So quite simply, the most privileged women are the ones with the most time and ability to talk the talk and walk the walk, the cultural spotlight will swivel towards "their" issues.Oh, and in case there is any doubt, your observation is not some "gotcha" moment that exposes feminism's hollow core. It is a depressing but expected consequence of the kind of biases that affect any human endeavor. The development and practice of intersectional feminism points the route towards trying harder and being better.
