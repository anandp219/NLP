 Ankit SethiI usually see NRIs of two kinds:Upper middle class with a social circle leaning towards exclusively Indians who selectively enjoy the perks of America but maintain the imagined community of the home country in their private lives. They might be insular or liberal but a common feature is that India is still the main reference point for their worldview, defining everything from the contents of their kitchen shelves to their definition of "national news."Upper middle class with a cosmopolitan social circle that are eager to integrate with the normative white culture. Respectability politics ensures they interact with lower income and black/Latino people minimally and view those people's "weird" (I'm being generous) behavior as a good reason to avoid public transportation and to live in gated communities.The point of the classification being that Indians in America either choose to let the "real America" into their lives very minimally or when they do, they are eager to assimilate with liberal white culture and are averse to engaging with minority cultures (if they do engage, it is only to the extent that they see whites themselves engaging - eating avocados, ordering fish tacos, dancing to rap that white people dance to etc.)Their wealth allows themselves to make either of these two lifestyle choices, and both ensure they never have to empathize much with minorities.The recent case of the old man thrown on his back by Alabama police is illuminating. Not one of the usual Indian enclaves like Jersey or a cosmopolitan city like San Francisco, the geographic location provided for a effective chance for real America to assert itself on the usually blinkered Indian community. While a bitter message was learned, that brown can sometimes be confused for black and treated as badly, a measure of privilege was also recognized and displayed - outrage by Indian American associations led to immediate firings, the Indian government made diplomatic overtures and a Kickstarter gathered many thousands of dollars to pay for the medical bills of the Gujarati grandfather. I'm not sure what lesson Indian people here took away from it - that desis need to be allies to #BlackLivesMatter and such civil rights causes, or that they need to better educate white people about the differences between their own upstanding gentry and the native troublemakers.And that would be my answer to your question - NRIs are okay with supporting majoritarian parties in India because they generally learn very little from their minority status in the US. They either manage to never feel the downsides of minority status or sublimate it into accidental Islamophobia or accidental anti-black racism which prevents the stinger from attaching to their own group identity.
