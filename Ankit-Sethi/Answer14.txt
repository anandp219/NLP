 Ankit SethiA Google Scholar/Google News search shows the phrase showing up in geographic contexts of countries such as Nigeria, Congo, Turkey, India, South Africa as well as contexts depending on membership in a social group such as the "epidemics" of campus rape, male rape, child rape etc.It's hard to definitively say that application of this term for India is especially unjustified. The word is simply very catchy. American news media tends to be an equal opportunity offender, and India is temporarily getting more of the attention than the rest.I would not directly compare the usage of "rape culture" and "rape epidemic" directly since a) "rape culture" is a holistic 360 feminist theory of social behaviors and mindsets that make sexual violence thrive; while b) "rape epidemic" is more of a numbers game. Put another way, "rape culture" conversations boil down to an ideological debate about how correct feminist thinkers are in diagnosing the causes of rape, while "rape epidemic" conversations are about the data and using to it to best characterize (or mischaracterize, depending on your skin in the game) the symptoms.In the context of the US reporting on India and other foreign countries, the common strain I can spot is that "epidemic" is meant to give the news piece an urgency and sensationalism that can seem clueless to people who've actually grown up and lived in that background being suddenly targeted for coverage.The US media has the power to culturally dominate and define what's news and what's not, on a global stage. So when they wake up to a long ongoing reality and play catchup by sensationalizing things while also behaving like their coverage finally validates the existence of the problem, local onlookers can end up feeling a bit like those Native tribes people being taught in school that Columbus discovered America - worth a few sighs of exasperation.
