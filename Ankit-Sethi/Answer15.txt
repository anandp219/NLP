 Ankit SethiThere are already various viewpoints on this thread, in favor and against, so I have little new to contribute except to say that there is still the matter of legal procedure and due process that is being overlooked by everyone here. An article in DNA India goes into details here: The problem with 'India's Daughter' is not just the narrative Briefly, the defendant has an ongoing appeals process going and India's Daughter would be a publicly and widely released documentary carrying a dubiously approved and probably extra-judicial confession. The defendant was quite likely not informed about the legal repercussions of this video recording, and it can be contended that it was the State's responsibility to do so since he is in the custody of the State. There is a set and fairly rigid procedure under which a confession may be taken and acted upon in legal proceedings, and if this video were to affect either the defendant's appeals process or the mercy petitions eventually written on his behalf, it can be argued that those set procedures have effectively been bypassed by the State. They get to have their cake and eat it too, violating his right to due process.Making the reasonable assumption that it is unrealistic to expect a firewall between this highly publicized documentary and the officers of the court involved in his case, it would be correct to stop the release of this documentary until his role in the judicial process is complete. I believe in this not just because I'm a stickler for rules and procedures, but I believe that a fair and just legal system that can be relied upon for recourse does far more for creating a safe environment for all its citizens than any change a documentary may or may not bring about.
