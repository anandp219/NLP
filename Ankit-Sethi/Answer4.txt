 Ankit SethiThe most prominent example of such a feud on TV right now is between Julianna Marguiles and Archie Punjabi on The Good Wife. The friendship between the two women characters was one the big draws of the show in the early seasons. Speculation has been rife since season 5 when they suddenly stopped appearing in scenes together, appeared to talk only through phone calls and kept "missing" each other though they worked in the same office.Though the conversations about the feud are unfounded speculations, the actors and producers of the show have pointedly deferred answering the question, suggesting that there are some difficulties. The most common reasons discussed online are Marguiles being uncomfortable with Panjabi's character Kalinda Sharma being a breakout hit and stealing focus away from her Alicia Florrick, since she is ostensibly the lead and titular 'Good Wife.'Archie Punjabi has left the show as of the Season 6 finale which concluded last week and it has been confirmed by news sources that the final scene between the two characters was shot using stand-ins and camera angle tricks. At the time of her departure, the two characters had not had a scene together for over 50 episodes.
