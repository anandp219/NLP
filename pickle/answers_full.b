S' Imagine this scenario. An enemy nation is just about to launch a nuclear attack on India. A bomb is about to hit Mumbai and kill 10 million people. You are the Indian Prime Minister and the head of your spy agency brings you a plan to kill the opposite general who is about to press the button. If he is dead, the war would come to a halt. The plan is foolproof and you could kill the person & stop the bomb. But, the method is devious. Which is ethical here - letting your spy chief kill that general or letting the nuclear weapon destroy your largest city & all its people? Mahabharata is a treatise on leadership and the moral dilemma they face. Killing, spying are all "unethical", but necessary to protect your people. If Mahabharata was just about "follow the rules and you will be fine", it will not be an epic. Real life cannot be reduced to a mere collection of rules and morals is the key lesson of the epic. Sometimes you have to make tough decisions to make and no matter what you it will be ethical. As a leader, you can break some of the rules if the intentions are right. It is fancy for an ascetic to preach morality, but for a commander in the battlefield to them all literally can be criminal. What if India\'s Chief of Army Staff drops all his weapons in the middle of the war just because some religious idea struck him? Would you not see that as a criminal negligence? He can be all religious in his own time, but in the battlefield his duty is to make sure India survives. Same for Arjuna.Dharma is about the preservation of righteousness in the society. A Dharma Yuddha is a war to protect that righteousness. If you could win such a war by book, it is good. But, if you cannot you should rather be willing to break the rules of engagement rather risk destroying the entire society. Yudhisthira did everything possible to follow every rule. He made sure he pleased everyone. He acted as a good king, a good brother and a courteous relative. Like every human he had his vices & temptations. By trying to please his cousins and avoid confrontations, he made everyone around him suffer.He lost the kingdom that was his right and was almost killed by his wicked cousins who tried to trap him in a house made of lacquer (Lakshagraha). After years of spending as a commoner he came back with power of Panchalas. His cousins cheated him with an infertile part of the kingdom with no city. Yudhisthira built a city and made the region into a prosperous one. He then went to please his cousins and lost everything. After in exile for 13 years, he came back to get his due right, but was not given. He went as low as getting 5 villages, but even that was not given. Yudhisthira - the epitome of perfection and goodness was losing because he was too inflexible to break the rules. In this process, it was not just he who suffered, but the whole society. Finally, Krishna found no choice but to encourage Yudhisthira to break a couple of the rule. Again, it was not a complete breakdown, but tactically bending some of the rules. It was made in good intention and its outcome ended the war & ensured the society\'s survival. That makes it a dharma yuddham.Real life cannot be reduced to a mere collection of rules and morals is the key lesson of the epic. If the rules you made up stand in the way of protecting your subjects, be willing to bend/break.'

S" The fundamental difference between liberals and conservatives is in how much of the past/present should be preserved for the future. Liberals are permissive and believe in the winds of change. Conservatives on the other want want to preserve the existing structures. Conservatives are more likely to value group memberships [family, race, religion, nation] as groups ensure stability. Liberals tend to value group memberships less [with the exception of labor unions] as groups slow down change.They have different views because they often have different experiences. Conservatives typically come from the dominant groups for whom the present is convenient. Liberals often from the challenger groups for whom change is necessary. Thus, minorities and immigrants are often liberals while someone from a majority community is more likely to be a conservative. This is why an India who might be a liberal in the US might be conservative in India. Again, there are economic conservatives and there are social conservatives. Economic conservatives tend to come from economically dominant groups and social conservatives often come from socially dominant groups. The next experience come from the location. Cities are often fast changing and city economies are built around profiting on change. The presence of a new tech is more like to change the city faster than a village. Thus, city residents are more likely to be liberal [if everything else is equal]. On the other hand, rural residents are more likely to be conservative as change comes less. Not all changes are positive though. City residents are also more likely to get into silly fads too for the same reason.The third experience comes from identity. Those with fairly consistent identities and comfortable in them are slightly more likely to be conservative. Those with multiple, conflicting identities [such as children of mixed racial couples] are not as likely to be conservative. Their identities are often as not strong enough.The final experience comes from prosperity. When things are working well, we often worry about change less. Liberal tendencies are slightly more present. When things don't work well, conservative tendencies are more present as people fear change and long for the rosier past. Europe had a conservative way just before the WWII, then the post-war prosperity brought a liberal wave and a 21st century conservative wave comes again as growth slows down."

S' I took a negotiations class around this topic once and I will try to bring ideas from that and other sources. First, a protest needs to have an objective. What outcome do you want out of the protest? That objective forms the end condition for the protest. "I would stop protesting, if I get X." This X must be spelled out clearly. For instance, when Airtel tried to break net neutrality we protested with the objective - "remove the recent VoIP tariffs". Without a concrete objective for a protest, it is running like an headless chicken.Second, the objective needs to be reasonable. If you had a child who is protesting to get a new car, you might not be able to do much. If the protest is for an extra candy or a book, maybe it could be considered. Third, a protest needs an organization. Who are the other people who are also looking for the objective? The bigger the objective, the bigger is the need for a large organization. At this point it becomes politics. There is nothing wrong with that. There is no way to achieve something without an organization. Is there an existing organization?Fourth, you need to pursue alternative ways of conflict resolution. Are there ways you can get close to the objective without a major protest? Are there ways to avoid confrontation? For instance, if I were a kid who wants a book, I might tell my dad that I will forgo candy for the next week. Show your key strengths and the ways in which you get the job done.If you cannot resolve the conflict way with talk, then get on the actual confrontation. It starts with conveying your message clearly. People cannot read your mind. Take the message to as many people. If the objective is reasonable many would share. Explore solutions that could get you to the objective. If you believe in the cause, pursue this relentlessly.'

S" Here is my guess as I found no references. Ancient Tamils avoided living next to public squares where multiple roads meet. These places facing major thoroughfare are for public buildings - such as temples and palaces. Due to the large movement of people, these were noisy and possibly even risky to have homes there. A common type of these are Three-way junctions (Muchandi) where the Tamils would not build homes. Facing such a junction is both losing privacy and also extra noise. It makes practical sense. Better to build a temple or some other public building there.In the modern world, we start fitting our old assumptions to the new reality. Some see the cul-de-sac akin to three way junctions [home opposite to the oncoming road] and fit the old assumptions. We don't question the purpose of the practice and make it a boolean decision [our ancestors were always right OR our culture is outdated]."

S" The Indo-Gangetic Plain that makes most of north India is the largest alluvial plain on entire earth. It spans some 630 million acres from the Indus to the Brahmaputra. It is watered by three great, independent, perennial river systems - Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra. Within this Indo-Gangetic plain there is no major mountain range, forest, lake or other natural barriers to prevent a consolidation of power.When someone asks why north India has so much people or why so many empires grew there, the simple answer is that the spread of water and silt over such a large region is not seen anywhere on earth. South India has no glacier fed perennial rivers nor such a big plain. The Ganges Basin alone is over 3 times the size of the Godhavari basin and about 12 times larger than the Kaveri basin. The plains of the south are smaller and divided by a number of large forests. Why is this relevant? The size and power of empires depended on the power of agricultural output that could be produced. Thus, northern empires were often much bigger than the southern ones. Also, within such a massive landmass there were frequent opportunity for feud. Such feuds are topics of a number of stories starting from the Rig Vedic Battle of the Ten Kings. South had fighting too, but the landmass provided some natural boundaries for the kings and due to the smaller size the battles were somewhat small too. Given the size and power of the Gangetic valley, it is not surprising that major battles happened there and major empires grew there. Mahabharata and Ramayana are epics about those northern empires. South has its glorious epics too - from the ancient Silapathigaram to modern day Ponniyin Selvan, just that most in the north don't take too much interest in them."

S" Some do. In my school, we had mock stock trading, covering even some advanced topics like debentures/preferred shares as early as 9th standard. It depends on how motivated, skilled and passionate the math/social science teachers are. Why don't many others do it?There is not enough recognition on the importance of investing/finance among the teachers. Some see the topics related to finance as too materialistic. Academia has historically been left leaning and topics like finance are not seen worth of their time. If I were to design the curriculum, I would just keep poetry, math, logic and personal finance as all other topics can be learned in adult life when basics are set right.The teachers themselves are very poor at investing or any topic related to personal finance. It is hard to get quality teachers who understand topics like investing and personal finance. The good ones in those topics go for more lucrative careers much early in the game."

S" Many do. When I first arrived in the US in 2004, the Indian Student Association at my University took care of all the key details. They helped me get the I-20 in time for my visa interview, prepare for the visa interview, sent a list of things to buy in India before the journey, a temporary place to stay after I landed, apartment lists of suggested places to hunt my apartment, list of good professors to choose as an advisor, pick the bank to helping me file my tax forms at the end of the year. They were so good at guiding that by the end of the first two weeks I was helping out with a couple of American citizens on some of the forms and key things related to the university. I could also save a big chunk of money at the end of the tax year knowing what deductions to claim. Some of my friends also got internships and assistanceships through the association. Although I notice that such camaraderie has gone down in the last decade due to a huge influx of Indian immigrants, it still exists. In parallel, the Fresh off the Boat (FoB) Indians are also bringing a lot bigger attitude than in the past. They don't necessarily ask the right questions or follow the guidance. That often spooks those who have settled here for a while. Humility has to be there on both the sides."

S" Humans grew up in groups and we are social creatures. Group loyalty is a part of our evolution and one of our survival technique. Instead of just thinking about just ourselves, we widen the circle to care for the group. Pride and loyalty are side effects of that relationship.The circles start with the family, then widens to include the tribe and then the region, language, religion, culture and so on. Until a few centuries ago, the circle had not fully widened to include nations. People still thought about their villages or regions. With better communication and transportation systems, people discovered commonalities in culture that preceded the modern incarnation of the nation. By one view, the nation is an extension of our family or tribe. Just as we feel special bonding towards our kids and immediate kin, we feel special bonds with the nation. These bonds help create the social order we live in. These bonds also help us react to problems in families that have no relationships with ours. The roots of great universities to great charity organizations lie in such bonds - often religious or nationalistic. People feel compelled to think beyond themselves and donate for the welfare of some strangers. It enables teamwork among strangers fighting for the same goal. US Army and other armies around the world could attract people who would sacrifice their own lives if needed for the community's welfare, because of this special bond.In modern corporations, we have realized the power of such bonds in enabling teamwork. We thus mimic many of the ideas that nationalists or even religious evangelists used in the past, to build team cohesion. We have team outings, team meetings, dressing around the company's logo/colors to even have songs and anthems.We feel proud because we are wired to feel special bonds with the groups we live in. Nation is just one of the dozens of groups/identities/badges we wear. Such bonds, pride and loyalty helps teamwork and social order and thus widely encouraged."

S' I don\'t see it going anywhere. Sooner or later some other issue will hog the media limelight and everyone will go after that. Exact same thing happened in case of the rape protests in India, the ice bucket challenges or the Occupy Wall Street in the US. People exaggerate ground reality and have a directionless protest, causing an eventual petering. It could come as early as Nov 8 [Bihar election results] or much later [especially if BJP loses].Two years ago, everyone and their goat commented on rising rape levels. Now, not many are talking about the Verma committee. What happened to those 10 proposals? How many of them are done? Who is following up these with the government? Who is making sure India is getting safer for women? None. Like the ice buckets & ALS, it is a fad that is as quickly forgotten as it got viral. That is sad. Because, we have not fixed a real problem there. Celebrities are no better than the common man in these fads. Like pouring the ice bucket, they make a quick statement of whatever is in the trend, make some noise and move on to the next fad. I have not seen any celebrity, including Narayana Murthy who made a comment in NDTV to bring their set of recommendations on how to solve the problem. A protest needs a direction and an organization. There needs to be a list of demands. In case of "intolerance", the demands could range from changing specific laws to asking for greater police/a special division to managing religious riots. What are the list of things the government must do to make India a tolerant nation? I don\'t see any credible list of demands. For instance, if a labour union fights with a single statement "workers are in pain" it will not get anywhere. If it makes a more specific demand "we need a 5% salary raise because of inflation" there is some scope for negotiations. Successful unions are fairly consistent with what they ask - like it or hate it, they get their way eventually. What are the specific things the protestors of "intolerance" asking? Where can I go and look at the central page for this organization? What are the list of concrete things they are demanding of the government? Whom should the government negotiate with, if they want a progress on this? If there is no clarity in any of the above, nothing would change on the ground.'

S' No one expects a civil engineer to rotate the bridge he built, by 90 degrees just because the customer changed his mind. No one expects a mechanical engineer who just designed a refrigerator to now repurpose his device as a microwave oven. On the other hand, customers often expect outrageous changes in their software. While your refrigerator or your car or your home has not changed that drastically in the past 40 years, your software changes quite drastically. Changing to the new requirements that quick means engineers sometimes take shortcuts, quickfixes and hacks rather than reengineering them. As technologies change fast, software engineers also spend less time with the manual than other kinds of engineers. Powerful development environments (IDEs) have also reduced the need for going to the manual and this just-in-time learning hampers understanding the big picture. Finally, software engineering as a discipline has existed for a lot less time than other engineering disciplines. It takes time to make the discipline rigorous.'

S" Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange are both private companies [sometimes people assume they are government organizations like the Reserve Bank]. Think of stock exchanges as eBay or your favorite shopping website. You can buy the same book published by the same company through multiple shopping websites. In the same way, you can buy Infosys stock through multiple stock exchanges. How many shops can you have? Many. As long as you have customers and suppliers. Same for the number of stock exchanges. As long as you have companies trying to sell their shares through you and traders trying to buy the shares, you can run a profitable stock exchange. We still have 21 although most are very small or irrelevant. Would you rather have just one Flipkart or have competition from multiple shopping websites so that the commission charged by the website is low? I would prefer multiple websites so that I could pick and choose. BSE is the older company dating back to 1875 and by 1992 the government found that it was slacking. BSE had no competition back then and its brokers were a closed group of merchants. There was very little technology, transparency or openness. That was not good for country that was just opening up.Thus, in 1992 Narasimha Rao prodded a bunch of government companies such as LIC, IDBI and SBI to create a new stock exchange company with the best of technology available and a much more open system of admitting brokers. Anyone with expertise could become a broker in this new company and not just some nephew of a powerful Dalal street merchant. This new exchange also provide better data on the prices and thus it became quite easy for ordinary traders to enter the stock markets.

S' It is just unfortunate and a game of politics. It can also be counterproductive as the left wing academia might be playing all its cards too early. That group is going all-in and staking all its credibility on an issue in which the central government has very little role to play. And most importantly, it is the nation that provides them the award. I feel they are insulting the nation for very little fault of them. For the first time since independence, the left wing academia has very little hold over the government and its only playing hand is when Modi is visiting abroad - especially the US and UK. The protests thus started to time with Modi\'s visit to the US and is peaking just before Modi\'s visit to the UK. Such protests gets attention of media in US & UK, and bad publicity for India at a crucial diplomatic visit could make the Indian government listen to them.Match a group that feels ignored and a government that puts marketing at the top of its game, and you get such weird protests. The accusation is not even one of government committing a crime or a scandal or even being negligent, but a government doesn\'t condemn publicly every crime that happens in India. This can tarnish some of India\'s reputation. Was India a more tolerant place in the past when schools were vandalized and professors attacked, maimed for remotely "insulting" a religion? How was the academia able to hold its conscience all this long when we have past so much bloodshed from every religious group [How do Indians feel about the many massacres that Indians have committed?]? If we stop our hypocrisy there will be a better fight against actual intolerance. If not, the award returning will have no impact on India. In the domestic politics, the award returning is actually counterproductive. The extremists in the right wing want to portray the academia as clueless marxists and by returning the academia is falling right into the trap. You can already hear some right wingers gloating. What this also does is it weakens the moderates within the right wing who want to respect those academics no matter what political opinion they have. On the whole, it might not have that much impact on India. None of the artists who returned those awards have any bit of following in the general public. General public has little recognition of the names of those returning the awards and some even accuse those who return as attention seekers [intelligent artists who are long past their prime].Most importantly, the actions just tarnish the name of the nation. If you have a beef with the BJP or Modi, go and fight them, but don\'t belittle your nation as none of the awards were given by the present government. I have very little respect for anyone who takes domestic politics to tarnish India\'s image abroad. Even if they were returning the awards to protest the Congress government, I would hate them for the same. Because, they are insulting the nation for the perceived faults of a political party.'

S" The people who keep overemphasizing the victory of the Labour government in 1945, don't often understand the sequence of steps that led up to India's independence. Labour election sure was important, but it just hastened the process by a couple of years. In May 1945, Lord Wavell [then the Viceroy of India] presented a detailed plan to the Indians for divesting the power. In the plan - Simla Conference - Indians would get full control of everything other than defense and foreign policy. In the government, only the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief would be British and the rest would be Indians. And this was done when Churchill was still in power. This was again a big move from the Government of India Act 1935, when Indians were allowed to elect their own governments, although their powers would be limited. Indians still didn't accept Wavell's plan as they wanted nothing but independence. By 1945, it already appeared to the British that India could not be ruled without the consent of Indians. Congress made it very expensive to conduct a government and various economic blockades by Gandhi made India not very profitable colony. The end of war also meant that the Indian soldiers and workers were not needed in as big numbers. Had the British tried to continue past 1947, there would have been chaos for which British government was not prepared for. As the old saying goes, British Indian government would drown in flood if the 400 million Indians were to just spit. By 1947, Indians were prepared for that and from that point it was impossible to govern. The best that was hoped was a respectful exit and continuation of economic ties."

S" Only a small fraction of the Indian Muslims belonged to the ruling class. Among that ruling class, a sizable chunk [such as the Nawab of Junagadh and many Zamindars in Awadh & elsewhere] migrated to Pakistan after the partition. A large section of Indian Muslims come from the lower segments of the Hindu society and thus face the same problems of their peers in the Hindu community. Instead of comparing Hindus v. Muslims as a whole, a better comparison would be comparing two people from the same locality/caste/class background, but only differ by religion. Besides the caste composition, there a several key factors:Geography: A large chunk of Indian Muslims live in poorer and often landlocked states. Muslim concentration is the highest in J&K, Assam, UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. Other than Kerala, all the other states have low incomes. In prosperous states such as Punjab, Delhi, Haryana, Goa, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra Muslim population is quite less. Page on prsindia.orgColonialism: While colonialism hit all of India, Muslims were slightly more impacted due to their occupation and geography. A lot of them were artisans working in cities like Lucknow and Varanasi. They were now out of job through industrial revolution. In the new metropolises of the colonial era - Bombay, Calcutta and Madras - Muslim population was traditionally low. Unlike the upper caste Hindus, they were not able to switch to the new economy when British Raj changed everything around. Rights of Muslim women: While Nehru pushed through major reforms in Hindu civil law, he was too cautious in doing the same to Muslim women. These laws on divorce, marriage and inheritance helped Hindu women grow better than their Muslim peers. In 1980s, Rajiv Gandhi's government went against even a basic grant of alimony to a Muslim woman in Shah Bano case. Again, it is all relative - we are just talking about say 5-10% difference in incomes and education. Hindu women too continue to face enormous challenges, but are slightly better placed than Muslim women. A community cannot develop without its women. Modernizing education system: As much as 10% of Muslim children study in Madrasas. Modernity And The Madrasa. These degrees are not recognized and don't prepare the students for the modern economy. Far less percentage of Hindus graduate from religious schools. Government has to look to get a sizable portion of them into the formal schooling. I have written another answer on the same topic: What are the reasons behind Indian Muslims' backwardness (educational, social, political, economic)?"

Only in the past two decades it seems to have shifted a lot into the lighter skinned actresses.While Tamils like many Indians prefer their icons light skinned, the male actors can get away with being dark if they can provide a powerful acting experience. Rajinikanth is dark skinned, but he has plenty of other positives to carry him through to the audience. The male actors have to be relatable and thus south Indian boys usually have a major advantage. On the other hand, actresses have no way to show their positives in acting qualities as their roles have become quite limited. Unlike even two decades ago, most of the actresses are brought from the north and the language is no big deal as they are not expected much anyway. They are made to play like dolls and in such a game the hottest light skinned girl wins regardless of how shabby the acting is. Since they have no character requirement to be relatable, homegrown girls don't have much advantage."

S" By sheer coincidence or impeccable timing, both of India's nuclear tests came at a time when a US President was on the verge of getting impeached. A President getting impeached is a very rare event and it puts the whole administration in disarray, unable to focus on the world. When a US President is distracted, words of rest of Western allies have no biting power.In 1974, India tested one device and didn't openly state it as a weapon. It called it a peaceful explosion. To prove the point, India conducted the tests on Buddha Jayanthi - the birthday of Buddha. The ambiguity and geopolitical factors of that time probably saved India from sanctions although it later impacted India's technological cooperation with the rest of the world. In 1998, India tested 5 advanced weapons and dropped the charade to declare itself a nuclear power. It again tested the bombs on Buddha's birthday but probably with a wink this time. There was also the politics. In 1998, the bombs were exploded when the right wing BJP was newly in power and US had a lot of uncertainty about the party. They didn't understand BJP as much as they understood Congress and this brought a quick reaction in the form of snctions. There was mutual hatred between the BJP and US government for a long time, until things were mended quite soon after the explosion.The ImpeachmentsIn 1974 (first test), Nixon was very close to being impeached [he eventually resigned before the impeachment] and his Vice President was gone on corruption charges. This left the secretary of state Henry Kissinger to run a headless show in Washington. Kissinger had also softened his stance on India since the 1971 war to liberate Bangladesh, in which US fought on the other side of India. This meant that US reaction was very muted. In 1998 (second test), Clinton was getting impeached few months down the road [later acquitted by the Senate]. He was battling a huge storm inside regarding his sexual affairs. That said, things were not as dire as in 1974 as the rest of the administration was not impacted as much. This left the President to impose sanctions quickly although some critics thought it was still somewhat soft.Another coincidence was that things moved pretty fast in the world of that time that there was hardly anytime to think about it. 1974 tests followed the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, where Pakistan was split into two and the tests were followed by huge domestic disturbance in India [Emergency]. There was massive inflation and oil crises world over too. It all put the nuclear question in lower priority in both the countries.In case of 1998, again there was the coincidence of a war with Pakistan that now followed the tests in 1999. Then a massive election scandal occurred in 2000 and a few months later September 11 changed the whole world for the US. Again, there were way many things moving around to focus on the nuclear question."

S" As others mentioned Modi has a Masters in Political Science and thus he is sure to have read Ambedkar's works. It might seem ironic and counterintuitive to some, but the sangh parivar seems to be genuinely taking into many of Ambedkar's teachings - including fighting caste. The reason is that castes & caste leaders stand in the way of RSS' consolidation of the Hindu base. And no group stands to gain from caste weakening as much as the RSS. Here is a fascinating article in The Hindu on this: Hindutva 2.0s new caste challenge. This significant pivot in the last decade is one key element in the resurgence of BJP. The pivot firmly rests on bringing minority caste in each state to power and weaken the grip of the majority castes. Thus, RSS put weight behind Modi in 2001 to weaken Patel control in Gujarat and later put weight behind Nitish Kumar [again from a minority caste] to weaken the Yadav base in Bihar. In UP they sacrificed some of their Brahmin votes to Mayawati to focus on the Dalits. In Rajasthan, they brought a non-Jat [Vasundra Raje] and in Maharashtra they brought a non-Maratha [Fadnavis] after a long time. When the Patels revolt or Shiv Sena goes berserk it is because RSS' pivot seems to be working way too well for them. RSS Wants No Bar for CastesIf you thought Modi had a thumping win merely because of his economic ideas or his social media activities, you are mistaken. There is something big going underneath.Ambedkar would not have approved RSS' methods nor does RSS accept all of Ambedkar's ideas, but there seems to be a genuine recognition of Ambedkarism in the right wing, even if only in parts. They might add him to their pantheon of outside heroes alongside Patel and Bose. For Modi and the Sangh, weakening the castes works well for their power interests because weakening castes also means weakening of many of their key opponents [caste leaders]."

S' In many cases it was threat of outright power and war. The most dramatic of this is the Indian integration of Hyderabad. That kingdom was as big as the whole of UK and Patel\'s troops annexed it under 5 days with a loss of just 32 men. They called it a "Police Action" to avoid getting attention in the international community It was among the most efficient military operations in history although the whole period before and after the operation was marred with massive atrocities against both Hindus and Muslims.The swift operation by Patel\'s men and excellent diplomacy by Nehru\'s meant that UN Security Council could not do much despite all of Hyderabad\'s and Pakistan\'s pleading. Patel also silently let the Communists weaken the Nizam\'s forces through massive peasant agitations in the months leading up to the annexation. In case of Junagadh that makes a sizable chunk of present Gujarat, India sort of waited until the opponent made a mistake and made full use of it. The nawab had already left the state and its new head Shah Nawaz Bhutto [grandfather of Benazir Bhutto and father of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto] made the mistake of annexing a couple of smaller rulers who had already conveyed an intention to join India. This act was use as a pretext to attack and again very swiftly bring the state into India. A plebiscite was later held to confirm the verdict. Indian integration of JunagadhIn case of Travancore [most of present Kerala] the king thought he had ports and economy to stake on his own Hindu kingdom. Once again the Communists helped Patel\'s cause. A massive peasant unrest and an assassination attempt on the diwan C. P. Ramaswami Iyer [likely Patel had nothing to do with this] brought the king crawling to join India.

Again, some of these were right wing on religion only (Bose) and some were right on both religion & economics (Rajaji and Patel). In the present day again we have one group that is primarily right on religion, but left on economics (the Sangh parivar & a lot of BJP), one group that is right on economics, but not as much on religion (the Swarajya group, the economists Jagdish Bhagwati, Aravinda Panagariya, Gurucharan Das & Ashok Desai) and the rest who are right on both aspects (one faction of BJP such as Arun Shourie). Traditionally, across the world right wing is short in academia. As the old saying goes, the left wingers with brains become professors and the right wingers with brains become entrepreneurs. The right wing is thus still short of more intellectuals, but the tide seems to be turning.'

S" India has seen ups and downs throughout its long history stretching beyond 5000 years. For thousands of years, India has had a common culture no matter which empire ruled and which empire fell. Mauryas, Satvahanas, Kushans, Guptas, Palas, Mughals, Marathas, the British Raj and finally Sardar Patel kept rebuilding the pieces after everything fell apart. Lots of people with a limited knowledge of India predicted that the nation would fall apart easily. They have very little clue of the very strong binding forces that underpin India. In 1940s, many historians thought the union would not last. As late as 1991, New York Times penned editorials about the impending collapse of India. Why India's Unity MattersPity India... Indian disunion would be a calamity for human rights... History suggests a terrible cost if India dissolves. India didn't dissolve. Instead, it has become a major force to reckon whether it is in economy, tech or military. We have seen extraordinary levels of violence in the past and the 1980s-90s were a severe test. We passed. For decades, media painted a bleak picture that the rise of the Hindu right would break India. It didn't. India continues to have very low crime rates in the world. Nothing today is worse than what it was 3 decades ago. The past two centuries have been down times for India and such down times have occurred for every civilization in history. In the 21st, we will get back to our groove.How did India remain united as one country after 1947, given its huge cultural diversity and religious differences?"

S" In 1947, when India was partitioned there was a lot of pain and confusion. Millions were uprooted and hundreds of thousands died. It was the biggest human tragedy in Indian history. Confused and angry, many mistakenly blamed all this on the Mahatma as he was the biggest target they could find. They thought he had the power to stop the partition [he didn't] and he had the power to stop the violence [he did stop a vast chunk of it in the east].For many on the Hindu right, Mahatma was seen as soft towards Muslims. They could not see his vision and his message of peace was seen as compromising. The biggest issue was the India's west [Punjab to Gujarat] was exploding and no one really anticipated. Indian leadership prepared for the worst in Bengal and sent Gandhi to put out the fires. And there was nothing really done to put out the fires in Punjab. They had no real plans and were stunned by the sheer scale of violence. Hindu right was extremely angry on the western side that Gandhi didn't come to save him. Ironically, if he were not assassinated, he would have proceeded to Punjab to control the violence there. And Mahatma did plan to go to Punjab even earlier [Sept 1947] but was retained in Delhi by Sardar Patel as the situation in the capital was even more dire.Many of Gandhi's peace objectives were also twisted. The sad thing was the rumor mill was the key factor. 55 crores to Pakistan: This was the much talked about thing of that day. Indian government over Pakistan Rs. 75 crores from splitting the treasury and gave an initial Rs. 20 crores. By the time it could give the remaining, the war in Kashmir begun. Some in the government want to block the money. Others wanted to pay. Although Mahatma Gandhi wanted the Indian government to pay what it owed, some twisted this as portraying the Mahatma having his major fast to arm twist the government to pay this money. That is absurd - why would he fast just for paying some amount of money? But, many don't question that. At the end of the day, the extremists some of whom didn't really oppose the partition wanted the Mahatma [the most vociferous opponent of the partition] to act as just a partisan Hindu instead of an Indian. They saw his overtures to bring all communities together as a threat. They mistakenly believed that the Mahatma was the source of this violence & believed he caused the partition and he fasted to pay the 55 crores to Pakistan."

S' It is an outdated theory that refuses to die. The idea is that there was a huge lost continent south of Tamil Nadu. While many civilizations believe in such submerged islands [Atlantis], the sheer size & imagination of Lemuria is massive. If it were a country it would probably be the second largest. When I was a school kid I too fantasized about that after being misinformed by some of my school teachers. The idea was invented in the 1860s when an English zoologist noted that there were these monkeys called Lemur that were found in Madagascar, India and some parts of South East Asia. Thus, he had an hypothesis that a landmass connected all the three. Later as we begun understanding geography and human evolution better this theory became untenable. While the scientists abandoned this theory, a fringe group of Indian/Tamil supremacists took hold of that theory. Around the turn of the 20th century, there was a huge interest in race, migration and nationalism. Some Indians thought that the superior blooded Aryans came from the North pole while a few others thought the Dravidians came from this lost continent. Both sides wanted to boost their egos at a time when the wave of nationalism and identity seeking at its heaviest. There surely was a massive landmass under Indian Ocean, but that was between 2 billion - 85 million years ago. Far before mammals, leave alone humans. Fragments of ancient continent buried under Indian OceanWhile I believe that there were such massive landmasses well before human history and there were possibly many cities submerged near TN coast line, it is crazy to believe in a huge continent that supported the ancient Tamil civilization.'

S" A lot of us naively believe that we can build our new cities without taking any bit of agricultural or forest land. The fact is that there is hardly any good land left in India that somebody is not already using for something. 40,000 acres is about 161 sq km. That is barely enough for a major city. London and New Delhi are about 10 times bigger than that. If things go by plan, up to a quarter of Andhra's 5 crore people will live in this major metropolis extending from Guntur to Vijayawada. How do you accommodate that big a population with all their apartments, schools, roads and hospitals?Maybe AP could build its capital in western Rayalseema districts without a lot of fields. If you build the capital in say Anantapur district, where would you get the water to support crores of future residents to this new capital city? The district is bone dry as it is. You need a massive water source to support a crore people. Historically, great cities have always been built next to rivers or other great water sources. In case of AP, this would have to be Krishna or Godavari. The problem is that every bit of land next to these rivers is fertile & used for agriculture. There is no way to build a great city without taking agricultural lands and that was true of most of the great cities in the world - whether it is Delhi or London or New York. Andhra Pradesh has an area of 3,95,87,200 acres of which farm lands are nearly nearly two-thirds. It is not running out of farm lands any time soon. Far less than 1% of this farmland is taken away for the capital and all other infrastructure projects. If there is an agricultural crisis it is not due to a shortage of land, but due to mismanagement of water, poor access to technology and lower productivity of the fields. India could potentially double the farm productivity enabling it to cut the arable land by as much as a half in the future."

Next up, the government should ban the use of decimal number system as these ten digits have been devised by some Hindus in the past. Hindu numeral system. Such a blatant use of Hindu cultural symbols in a secular nation would hurt the sentiments of so many. To avoid the risk of India becoming a Hindu nation, the government should be made to use only Roman numerals everywhere. MMMMDCXXXVII crores this year should be earmarked for reprinting government documents. OMG can I use crores here without hurting anyone\'s sentiment? Because it is from Koti that is used in many Hindu scriptures. After that we should picket the homes of Viswanathan Anand, Koneru Humpy and other Chess grandmasters. How dare they publicly play a game devised by the Hindu monarchs. Such a casteist, racist, non-secular game where the white plays first must be banned. That is blatantly varna system and these upper caste slave owners are hurting the sentiments of millions. Balaji Viswanathan\'s answer to Is it racist that white makes the first move in a game of chess? After this, we will go after the school kids learning trignometry. The first use of sine and cosine tables come from ryabhaa\'s sine table and using such trigonometric tables in a blatant way from a Hindu would hurt the sentiments of so many. Next we will go after Diamonds. Those shiny rocks that some Hindu folks first discovered are playing havoc when it comes to buying rings. These stones long used as religious icons is non-secular. We will ban the entire diamond industry [double bonus, it is centered in Modi\'s state] and anyone wearing diamonds will be labeled as Modi bhakt. Finally, all Indian dance forms, music forms, drama arts should be banned near all government offices, because they all have their roots in religion. We should also take our lion emblem out, the national motto [Satyameva Jayate] and even the national flag because they all have religious symbols underneath.Secularism means a saint like Sankaracharya would not be passing laws in the Parliament, you will not be barred from becoming the head of the country merely because you are from religion X and the court would not punish you merely for not following a principle from Gita. But, it doesn\'t mean every element of Indian culture be removed from the public. Secularism primarily had its roots in Europe, where the Church historically had an outsized role. Indian religions don\'t have such a central church nor a powerful Pope and thus our Constitution was not written with the problems & paranoia of Europe in mind. Indian version of secularism is about tolerance and acceptance of all faiths like we always did through history, not a fanatic removal of cultural/historic symbols from public life. Should an Egyptian be forced to defend their great pyramids? Is a Greek expected to avoid talking about Herodotus or Alexander or any Greek symbol because of a possible (later) connotation with the crusades? Why is an Indian expected to avoid ancient Indian symbols and culture just because some outsider put a "religion" tag over this?Is the "Om" specific to only "Hinduism" or is it spread across a variety of Indian cultures? Where does Indian culture end and "Hindu" religion begin? How do you plan to whitewash Hindu religious elements without whitewashing Indian culture too? Once you whitewash this culture on what does the nation rest upon?'

S" One thing I want to add to Luke's good answer is that it also depends on which class & locality you are born in. If you are going to be born as a poor villager, then India is likely worse than Vietnam, Iran and China. India's healthcare, sanitation and primary education is terrible if you are poor.If you are going to be born in a rich, urban family India is the best place to be in. Ultra rich often face trouble from the party in China and face slightly more security issues in Vietnam. A rich Indian can have an outsized power in the society, have access to great education & healthcare and can also greatly utilize India's fast growing economy. Politicians, media, army and the civil society will not come in the way of a rich person. If you are going to be in the urban middle class, it is a tie between China and India. Middle class Chinese have a variety of advantages - such as far better roads, airports, trains & uninterrupted power, while a middle class Indian has better political power, the benefit of English & better relations with the west to travel the world more. A simple example is that, for an Indian it is fairly easy to get a 10 year multiple entry visitor visa in US, while until recently Chinese were limited to 6 months at a time [due to reciprocal arrangements]. Middle class Indians and Chinese are thus roughly comparable in the range of benefits they can get from the society.Edit: There seems to be some confusion in the comment thread on what Middle Class means. Middle Class in Indian standards refers to about $600/month [10 times less than in the west] and that translates to about Rs. 40,000/month. Only a small fraction of India is in middle or upper middle. Everyone in India thinks they are 'middle class' and almost no one actually is"

That way you have the new city that will be in addition to other cities, nor be a mere replacement. Just as New Delhi subsumed old Delhi, Amaravati would subsume Guntur and Vijayawada - this way providing a taste of the old culture and the modernity of the new city.

S" Gupta empire is the longest of major Indian empires extending for nearly three centuries. Mauryan empire lasted about 150 years; Mughal and British Raj each lasted slightly less than 200 years each. It had among the strongest of militaries and most efficient of administration among any Indian empire.It is in Gupta dynasty in which India had some of its greatest achievements. From chess to sex (kamasutra), from zero to Shakuntala, from Panchatantra to ayurvedha, the key elements that defined Indian history were made then. Aryabhatta developed 0 and the number system in this period. Varahamihira built the greatest works on Indian astronomy. Kamasutra was written by Vatsayana, Kalidasa brought the greatest of Indian drama that impacts Indian art to this day while Vishnu Sharma's Panchatantra stories entertain Indian kids to this day. In visual arts, we see stunning elements of Gupta art in UNESCO world heritage sites such as the Ajanta & Ellora caves [part of the caves were developed in Satvahana period though]. Sushruta brought some of the greatest medicinal works for his period. It was under the Gupta, Indian education went to great heights with the establishment of the Nalanda University among others. It is fascinating to see that even after 1500 years their works are as good as new to us. We are continued to be fascinated by Shakuntala, Chess, zero, Panchatantra and Kamasutra. And Nalanda stands as a great inspiration for what can achieve.Literature, mathematics, physics, painting, medicine and religion were all in their glorious heights, while there was social stability, peace and economic prosperity. It is easily the golden age. If I had a time machine, 400 AD Ujjain would be my destination followed by 1000 AD Thanjavur [Chola Empire]."

That is more youth than US and China combined. India has worlds largest youth population: UN reportThis means we have a population that can potentially jump to the newest technologies and ideas without the burden of past baggage just as easily as Indians took Quora. We could quickly climb up the economic ladder by skipping past the past. Politics can move quite quickly the elections of Modi and Kejriwal showed. On the flip side, we have a huge population for which we don't generate enough jobs or have enough skill development avenues. Unemployment, crime and social unrest can happen if the expectations are not matched. The second feature is the arable land. India has almost as much arable land as United States - world's leader in that measure. With 162 million hectares of fertile land, India has more agricultural land than even China with more than thrice its area. This was the key feature that helped India throughout history. However, as we need land to build homes, factories and roads, we would have to take a chunk of this arable land. We cannot eliminate poverty without building people homes and jobs. This means India's success or failure will depend on how much of the agricultural land it can take away for other uses & make sure these are utilized well."

S" In case of the first wave of English colonies (16th-18th centuries), the people from England settled in those colonies. Not just some men toting guns, but whole families - men, women and kids who made their voyage on Mayflower and countless other ships. Due to a variety of religious revolutions and civil war, many common English folk took these ships as a way out. In contrast, in other European countries there was not as much pain in that period to move whole families out. French, Dutch, Germans and Italians just stayed put at home. Only a few young men were sent and they would return after their mission. No major families or settlements abroad. Spanish and Portuguese settled more than the French and Dutch, but still were not moving as much as the English. [South Africa was one exception for the Dutch. There they Dutch stayed in large numbers & had a prosperous nation that was at the same time the worst for the natives.]In that wave of English colonies - US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - the locals were mostly driven out to remote settlements and the English immigrants totally took over the land. They brought their ideas and technology and built their homes. Since they were settling permanently they were more vested in ensuring rights, liberty etc. Other colonial settlers were not settling for good and out there to make a fast buck out of the resources and markets. Thus, they never setup as good infrastructure - social and physical. They also didn't bring the best of their technology. At the same time, other colonial powers didn't always wipe the native cultures as much as the English did at that time. From the late 18th century onwards the situation flipped. It was now the English who were done with the civil wars & revolutions and the rest of Europe picking up the chaos. Englishmen stopped settling outside in droves and in the second wave of colonization - India, Malaysia, Kenya, Egypt - they did like what other colonial powers did. They sent their young men to war, to trade and to rule, but they didn't send their families to settle. This meant that the native cultures were not exterminated, but at the same time the colonial masters had little incentive to think in the colony's main interests - as they were not settling there anyway. It was at this time that a lot of Germans, Italians, Irish and other Europeans took the boats to escape the chaos. They settled in large numbers in the US and elsewhere. However, by then England and other powers had already setup their culture. Thus, even when Germans rivalled the English in numbers in North America, US & Canada never turned German, but remained British. Britain's colonies ended in two extremities. On one end you have prosperous ones like US & Australia and on other end you have Myanmar, Zimbabwe, Sudan, etc. The difference is how many English tried to make the colony as their home vs see it merely as a land for exploitation. South Africa fall somewhere inbetween. At the end of the day, colonization provided two choices - lose all native civilization & culture or lose all of economic power & prosperity. All colonies lost at least one of the two. If the Native Americans & Aborigines lost their civilization & homelands, Indians & Egyptians lost their economic prosperity."

India while supporting Mukti Bahini and other rebel movements, was not officially a part of it.The two weeks between December 3 and 16 of that year was the Indo-Pakistan war. Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Pakistan started it by sending a bunch of jets to attack India and India hit back. Both countries involved their navy, airforce and army. India captured territory and armed forces. And the war was not just in Bengal, but all over South Asia. India even had to cover up Taj Mahal as Pakistan jets tried to hit Agra. It was the only time India lost a warship as INS Khukri (F149) was sunk with 176 sailors. India has done such sacrifices during that war and taking India's name out of that war is sheer insensitive for any Bangladeshi. In short, there was a Bangladeshi civil war for the most part of 1971 and then a direct Indo-Pakistan war at the end of it. Both are important and related, but different. "

S" A big factor is the Kissinger's diplomacy in the region that time. In their massive geopolitical game with USSR, US was blinded on its own key principles - killing democracy in Iran and Afghanistan, helping the French fight freedom fighters in Vietnam and helping Pakistan unleash a major genocide (1971 Bangladesh genocide). In the process of helping Pakistan during that genocide, Nixon made India very insecure, forcing it to go nuclear. While India was always interested in going nuclear, the key event that tipped the balance was the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war. In that war, India was able to split Pakistan into two - create the new nation of Bangladesh. But, it was also a war that made India nervous because a number of big nations was on the side of Pakistan. US, UK, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia all threw their weight behind Pakistan. Sri Lanka provided logistical support and China helped slightly with weapons. The US 7th fleet was closing in on Bay of Bengal [US forces had orders to target Indian Army in 1971] and the danger of US fighting India directly was only avoided by the massive presence of Russian ships blocking off that route - 1971 War: How Russia sank Nixons gunboat diplomacy. China too luckily didn't bite Kissinger's tasty treat of attacking India on all 4 directions.After the war was won, Indians never forgot how close they got to being surrounded by world's superpowers for the mere fault of trying to stop a major genocide in what is now Bangladesh. India understood the importance of nuclear deterrence and also the value of military power. Nine months after the war, Indian Prime Minister ordered the preparation for the test. Within the next 20 months, India tested its first bomb.Indira Gandhi knew that the west would react harshly, but she had very little to lose. The west had already burnt its bridges in the 1971 episode and there was very little moral, economic, military or strategic argument that the west could make to stop India from going nuclear. By going nuclear, India is actually able to help its poor. Wars affect poor disproportionately and through the power of nuclear weapons, India was able to stop fighting wars. No one dares bomb a country with nuclear arsenal. India's last full scale war was in 1971. By proving its worth, India got recognized by the western powers on a more equal footing and the resulting large trade since late 90s has helped chunk of poor grow to middle class.The post-nuclear India is far better at protecting its people than the pre-nuclear India."

S' Trying to catch the Indian Air Force napping, Yahya Khan, launched a Pakistani version of Israels 1967 air blitz in hopes that one rapid attack would cripple Indias far superior air power. But India was alert, Pakistani pilots were inept, and Yahyas strategy of scattering his thin air force over a dozen air fields was a bust!  -- Newsweek, 20 Dec 1971Pakistan officially began the war. The details are a bit more complicated though. The genesis of the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war lay in the 1970 Bhola cyclone - the deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in history and one that killed nearly half million people in East Pakistan. Remember, back then Pakistan had an eastern wing and an western wing.Pakistan\'s leadership was very slow to address the damage in a region it had traditionally ignored. Coincidentally, Pakistan had its national elections just 3 weeks after that disaster. The angry masses of East Pakistan whose traditional grievance got aggravated by the cyclone, came in large numbers to provide a thumping victory to Mujibur Rahman led Awami league. Pakistani general election, 1970This meant that the center of power had finally passed from the Punjab region to the Bengal region where Awami league was predominantly based. However, that didn\'t turn out to become a reality. Mujibur was never allowed to become the Prime Minister as the national assembly meeting [Parliament] to have these elected representatives vote their PM was postponed. By March, 4 months after the elections, the Awami league grew impatient and launched a non-cooperation movement. In response, Pakistan\'s President Yahya Khan imposed a martial law and a brutal repression of the Bengalis [especially the Bengali Hindus and Bengali intelligentsia] termed the Operation Searchlight.On 25th March, Mujib was arrested and taken to West Pakistan. This led a major outcry and a rebel commander named Ziaur Rahman declared the independence of East Pakistan on 26th March in a radio address. I, Major Ziaur Rahman, do hereby declare the Independence of Bangladesh in the name of our great leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.[This day is now celebrated as the Bangladesh independence day. After independence, Mujib would be the President until 1975 when he and most of his family was assassinated. Zia became the first dictator following him. Their daughters - Sheikh Hasina - daughter of Mujib and Khaleda Zia - wife of Zia are the two major leaders of present Bangladesh - keeping the rivalry alive to this day. Hasina and her sister were the lone survivors in their family\'s brutal assassination, as they were studying in Germany].Back to March 1971. As protests exploded in East Pakistan, refugees came in droves to India. The plight of Hindus especially moved India reminding of the brutal scenes of 1947. Indian PM Indira Gandhi assisted the rebels with money, training and arms. Throughout that year things becoming getting worse for both India and Pakistan. Pakistan was now emboldened by the warmed relations with her two friends US & China and truly believed that the help of the major powers would help her "Crush India" - major campaign slogan across Pakistan. 24 Crucial Facts About 1971 War When India Bifurcated PakistanBy the beginning of December, war was imminent. It was then that Yahya Khan tried what Israel did 4 years ago to the Arab countries. On Dec 3, he launched waves of planes to cripple Indian air defense and named it Operation Chengiz Khan. Unfortunately for Pakistan, despite all the inspiration it was neither the great Khan nor Israel. PAF tried to hit as far as Agra, but India had the Taj covered. [Partial covering shown below]India quickly hit back. At the height of the cold war, in it Pakistan was assisted in that war by Saudi Arabia, United States, United Kingdom, Indonesia, Sri Lanka. The bigger power China, expected to join, didn\'t. However, even with all that external support Pakistan could not face the onslaught of the much superior Indian forces. Soviet Union\'s task force too thwarted any US Navy involvement in the Bay of Bengal. 1971 War: How Russia sank Nixons gunboat diplomacyPakistan, at the end, lost far more aircrafts, far more ships and far more men. It was cut into two and it surrendered within 12 days of the beginning of the war. Instrument of Surrender (1971). It was a stunning collapse from the euphoria of catching Indians napping to surrendering tens of thousands of men in an embarrassing surrender - all under two weeks.ConsequencesIt was a defining moment in Indian history. It was one of its biggest military victories in the modern era. It led to its later confident rise.Cutting up Pakistan\'s access to most of the Indian ocean & South East Asia with the loss of Bangladesh was a huge strategic gain for India. This was the only war when US and India came close to facing off against each other. Only Soviet Union\'s nuclear triad put out this nasty standoff. The value of nuclear deterrence was far clear to India now and India went nuclear not long after this war - Smiling Buddha.While Pakistan\'s military spun up their military disappointments positively in 1948 and 1965, in 1971 it was hard to cover up the defeat. Bifurcation of the nation even with the world\'s leading powers supporting it, was too hard for the military to explain away. Thus, Pakistan switched its whole strategy to covert warfare fronted by rebels and 1971 became the last full scale war between the two countries. The victory eventually allowed India to build friendships with the countries that sided Pakistan - US, UK, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. External powers bet on the winning horse and Indira Gandhi ensured that hers was the top dog in South Asia and not Pakistan.'

S" Let's separate Qatar & Brunei from Luxembourg, Singapore, Hong Kong, Liechtenstein etc. Qatar has the world's third largest deposits of natural gas and has less than 300,000 citizens. If you divide that large a resource among that small a population you get crazy high income. Apart from the energy, it doesn't have any important industry worth mentioning. Brunei is somewhat close to that description.Regarding Singapore, Hong Kong, Luxembourg etc they are trading cities sitting next to massive countries. Cities are in general wealthier than the countryside. If Mumbai and Shanghai were counted as independent countries, they have a higher GDP than Singapore and Hong Kong compressed in a comparable geographic area. List of cities by GDP. Does that mean Mumbai and Shanghai are better than Singapore and Hong Kong? By being counted in larger nations with much higher rural population their GDPs are sometimes less appreciated.Thus, it is not about being a small country or a large country. It is about being a city sitting in an important trade route vs. a rural region stuck somewhere. Singapore is a small rich city-state in an important trade route while Nauru is a small poor rural nation that has no such benefit. In the same way, USA is an large rich urbanized nation with massive amount of trade while India is a large poor rural nation with far less trade. While we should surely learn a lot from Singapore and Hong Kong, we should also make sure we are comparing apples vs apples - Singapore vs commercial cities in a country than the entire country itself."

S" Siddhartha was probably born in Nepal. But, Buddha was born in India ;-)That is a cheeky way of saying both nations can claim ownership of him and that the India-Nepal division didn't exist at the time of Buddha. In that sense, Buddha was like William the Conqueror who though born in what is now France is mostly associated as the King of England. Buddha was born in the capital town of the Shakya kingdom. There is no agreement on where exactly this capital was. There are 3 close towns that each claim to be the birthplace of Siddhartha and the capital of that kingdom. Two of them are in present day Nepal and one in present India. All 3 towns are along the modern India-Nepal border. ASI digs into Buddha home debate. PBS produced an award winning documentary on this topic in 2013 although it ends inconclusive. Bones of the BuddhaLumbini in Nepal is the most popular of the three. Given that Lumbini is in present Nepal, they have a part claim to his legacy. However, the prince who was born in that capital town achieved glory when he meditated under a Bodhi tree at Gaya, changed the world through his sermon at Sarnath and eventually claimed his divine abode in Kushinagar. All of these places are in present India. That means India can also claim his legacy regardless of whether Piprahwa was his birthplace or not.At the time of Buddha, the political boundaries were also different from that of today. India is a cultural union that touched almost all of the subcontinent, but the political boundaries were often different from that. Here is India at the time of Buddha and the kingdoms straddled the present day borders. "

Building modern states along ethnic lines is something that doesn't fit with India's model of multi-ethnicity and it is fraught with dangers. If India supports Kurdish identity [who span multiple modern nations - Iran, Iraq, Syria, Turkey] what about the question of Nagas who span India and Myanmar. That is dangerous. Recognizing a Kurdish state might bring India directly in conflict with Iran, Turkey and Iraq. Iran is a traditional friend and with Turkey India is trying to open new relationships. Traditionally India has avoided such touchy, controversial issues and it would ideally push for Kurds to be worked into the national framework wherever they live."

S" The premise is disputed. I will still take the bite. India is traditionally resource-constrained, while Europe & US is labor constrained. India has a lot of labor, and Europe-US have a lot of resources. This have an impact on the respective lifestyles.In the US, I can easily afford a Dishwasher, have access to reliable water and lot of electricity. In India, my maid would wash with much lesser water and electricity than that. While driving, I use the automatic in the US as the gas/petrol prices are quite low and the decrease in efficiency is worth the comfort. In India, the resource price is higher and might go for a chauffeur driving a manual. Most Indian families do fine in the US as they quickly adjust to the new society as above. They don't miss their maids and chauffeurs much.Things get tricky when you have a child. Unlike dishwashing or vacuuming, childcare cannot be automated and thus it is fairly hard to raise kids. You need to constantly look after them, run after them and clean after them. This is where many Indians miss labor abundance back home. Thus, many Indians ask the help of their parents to help with the kids. Locals too have huge trouble managing kids without nannies, but they have a wider support network [parents, siblings, friends, cousins] locally while Indians in US often have none. In summary, it is not about daily chores there is a problem. It is in raising kids where expat Indians often face a pain. Kids are lovely, but also take up a lot of energy to manage."

S' Other than the 19-20th century CE, cold weather regions were not really ahead of the economies of warmer regions. Historically, the civilization was centered around warm, tropics & subtropics. The first 5 civilizations - Sumer, Nile valley, Indus Valley, Yellow river valley, Norte Chico - were all in subtropics. The ones that followed - in Greece, Persia, Rome were in the same zone too. [Subtropics often were better than tropics because the latter was often next to dense rainforests with wildlife & epidemic dangers.] Still the warmer regions performed better throughout history. Colonialism changed this dynamic for the first time. I will explain this how. The cold weather regions have very low population density as not many people preferred cold winters. This allowed the farmers to have much larger lands and more potential mines & mineral resources. Until the modern era, these were hard to tap though.When industrial revolution came, the technology drastically helped those in cold climates. Mechanised farming - tractors and other machines - allowed industrial scale farming over those lands. This allowed the farmers to get rich because they had now huge lands that could be fully tapped. Factories also could now get minerals resources and infrastructure as large parts of their countries were sparsely occupied. In contrast, industrial revolution could not do much to densely populated tropics that already had high farming productivity - but shared by a large number of farmers. Tropics were too densely populated - meaning lesser resources & lesser room or infrastructure.Other aspect colonialism did was to open up huge markets. England had a small domestic market - population was small. But, through its colonies it got a huge market for its textile mills and industries. In earlier times there was not much international trade and thus those in sparsely populated regions could not benefit from their innovations.In 21st century CE, we are entering a post-industrial era and the pendulum might be shifting again. Mines and lands are not as important as they were in say 20th century. It is about the number of minds networked. In this, the subtropics/tropics such as California, Singapore, Shanghai or Bangalore are getting back in the game. The size of the domestic market matters big once again - as Californian startups could attest and density helps in various other ways too for an information economy.'

S' Many nationalist Indians would say yes. And once India has joined Nepal, there would be reallocation of seats in the legislature. Given India\'s size and population, 95% of the Nepali parliament would be Indians. These legislators would then pass a law to change the name of the country to India and change some of the national symbols. The rest of it would not have to change much as India and Nepal share a common culture. Job done ;-)I always smile when nationalists of other countries desire for a large chunk of India. There is the "Greater Nepal" or "Khoarsan", "Mughalistan" etc. If a sizable chunk of India is joined with Nepal or Pakistan or whatever other country, that resulting county would be Hindu by the sheer size of Indian population. Thus, Indians would be the dominant population in that "Greater Nepal" and they would legislate a variety of things that Nepalese might not like.'

And this didn\'t start in modern era, but is as old as human civilization. Tribes around the world have painted their faces in all sorts of fancy colors for ceremonial reasons as well as for aesthetic reasons.We probably carry innate animal tendencies to spend effort on looking for our mate and make ourselves attractive in the process. Skin is a good indicator of a body\'s health and thus people do all sorts of things to make the skin appear good to "prospective mates". In some places, tribes would abandon their children or even kill if they were born light skinned (Persecution of people with albinism). In other places, being born as dark skinned would bring discrimination. It is all about what each society thinks of being healthy. And in modern world most often these are stupid intolerance.

S" As others mention, Japan and Germany have a sizable military. That said, post Second World War, both Japan and Germany put strong anti-war provisions in their Constitutions. This was partly pushed by the allies controlling their territory and partly came about as the moderates came out in disgust of the calamity. Article 9 of the Japanese ConstitutionThe world war also pushed out the hard right wing out of power for a long time. The prospect of having a highly weak army that would invariably draw comparisons with their military past also meant that military's purpose was strictly defined to domestic security. Also, the need for a large military became moot after the US military umbrella promised them to secure their resources. Hitler went after Russia to secure oil in its south. Japan went after SE Asia to secure iron ore and other raw materials. Post-WW2, both nations got all their major resource access protected by US and this provided very little rationale for war. In some sense, western nations pay an implicit tax to the US in return for US fighting wars to protect all of their trade routes and raw materials. This is Adam Smith's specialization."

S" It was a marriage of convenience primarily connected by their common fear of the Soviet Union. Both hated the Communists and in the 1930s signed an anti-Comintern pact. Otherwise there was little ideology overlap as Hitler thought China to be their ally and Japan was looking at UK. As China entered into a pact with USSR, Hitler moved to Japan and as Hitler was gaining on UK, Japan wanted to pick the winning side in Europe.Later, both found US to be a huge threat and feared the entry of US against them. This moved them even closer and once US entered the war against Japan, Germany too declared war. Ultimately both fought two different wars. While we simplistically group them as WW2 just because the Allies fought both, there was not much overlap between the Pacific and the Atlantic war. They started and ended on different times, involved different motivations and strategies and didn't even share much of troops or resources due to geographical barriers."

India and Iran are very strongly related culturally throughout history. They share the same race, same family of languages. Iran means the "land of the Aryans" and Arya has superior connotations in India. Until Hitler came to misuse the term, it used to be much widely used. Hinduism and Zoroastrianism are sister religions worshipping the same gods. Later, Islam spread into India and Persian culture became widespread - in food, language etc. Then there is Afghanistan.

S' They will not sue you and this won\'t ruin your life. They will likely (but not necessarily) revoke your offer though.As for other people saying that this isn\'t cheating, but rather you just demonstrated that you can solve business problems efficiently: Please don\'t listen to their justifications. You seem like an otherwise honest person, or at least someone who strives to be that way. Don\'t let them throw you off your ethical track.If the rules of the interview -- implicit or explicit -- were that you can\'t look up things during the interview, then you cheated. Period.Of course, in the business world, you can use Google. But interviewers don\'t ask you a question to figure out if you could solve this question in the real world. They ask you to derive some information about you (your depth of knowledge, your problem solving skills, etc). From there, they make a guess at your ability to do the work.You cheated. You gave them a false impression of your skills because you broke the rules.Nothing will ever remove the fact that you cheated. It already happened. The only thing you can change is whether you got your job by cheating.The question is: Do you want this new job so badly that you\'re willing to sit with the knowledge for the rest of your life that you kicked off your career and got ahead with dishonesty? From what you said, I believe that you\'re a generally honest person (perhaps even exceptionally honest) who made a mistake. I\'d worry that you\'d end up being pretty unhappy at this company as you might never really feel right in the role.The company might still decide to take you if you confess. Maybe. Or maybe they\'ll decide to just reinterview you. Or maybe you\'ll wind up somewhere else in the end. None of these are ideal situations, but at least you will have no longer gotten ahead via dishonesty. If you do confess, I wouldn\'t use the word "cheating." I would just describe the situation honestly:Although I\'m really excited about the opportunities at <company>, I wanted to be honest about my interviews. While the interviewers asked me questions, I looked up answers online. I feel that this might have been a key factor in the offer decisions and I feel pretty uncomfortable about this at an ethical level. I worry that my use of the Internet might have made me seem more qualified than I am.This is behavior is really out of character for me, and I really regret my actions. That\'s why I wanted to let you know what had happened and see how to proceed.I expect that you will likely revoke my offer with this disclosure, and I absolutely understand that decision (much as I would be disappointed). Alternatively, if you\'d like to give me some additional interviews, I would love that opportunity too. I assure you that, regardless of your decision, this will never happen again with this company or another. I really value ethics in my personal and professional life, and I\'m really sorry that I didn\'t act in accordance with my own standards.I can\'t tell you what to do, but I can say that you\'ll be much prouder of yourself if you decline the offer -- even if you don\'t confess what you did.Good luck.'

S' Not particularly. I think it\'s good to discuss what good interview processes look like.However, I do think that many people\'s points are poorly thought out. (Then again, I think the same thing about pretty much any issue, so it hardly makes it worse here.)Many people\'s logic is: "Algorithm interviews are broken because of X, therefore we should all switch to Y instead." The problem is that Y is also broken in its own ways. All interview processes have their flaws. Developer Interviews are Broken, and You Can\'t Fix ItThe other key logical problem people make is the assumption that the interview process should mirror "real life." That\'s not actually true. The interview should assess relevant, important skills, but it doesn\'t need to be "real life." In other cases, many people just don\'t understand what the process is all about. They\'ll argue, for example, that it\'s ridiculous for an interviewer to expect you to write perfect code on a whiteboard. Well, yes, it is. But, generally speaking, a single bug does not lead to a rejection. (And if it does, then that company\'s implementation is very broken, but that doesn\'t mean that the process as a whole is broken.)I think many people\'s objections (or ultimate conclusions) are misinformed or just poorly thought through, but I\'m not particularly tired of people making them. Or, at least, I\'m less tired of them than I am of objections on many other issues.Now, people misspelling my name on the other hand... sigh.'

S' You dont ask someone to be your friend. So why do you ask them to be your mentor?Think about your closest friends  or even your less close friends. When you asked them to be your friend, what were your terms? How often would you hang out? What would you do? What would the expectations be on each side? Oh. You didnt do any of that. You didnt ask them to be your friend. That would be weird. Plus, how would they know if they like you before they know you? Its a sort of ridiculous question to ask or answer.But somehow or other, you just became friends. Maybe you just fell into friendship by hanging around each other enough. Maybe there was something specific that connected you, like having children the same age. Maybe someone introduced you two because you just moved to their city. Somehow or other, nothingness evolved into friendship.Like friendships, mentorships  the ones that actually exist, not the ones that exist in name only  rarely start from a formal request, and certainly not from a near stranger. It doesnt work for mostly the same reasons. Its artificially trying to create a personal relationship. Doesnt work.Moreover, with many mentorship requests (especially those between strangers), the more junior person is often not actually committed to making it work. If youve never sought out my advice before, why do you think youre now going to want to regularly get it? More likely, you suddenly thought Know what I could use? A mentor. Your interest will likely wane.Lets be honest: neither of us are likely to follow through with this mentorship, even if we both intend to.A pretty typical mentorship request:How to Get a Mentor Without Asking for a MentorIf you want someone to be your mentor, dont ask them to be your mentor. Let it build (or collapse) authentically.That doesnt mean you cant seek out mentorships. You can, just like you can friendships. Theyre not all that different. Both are fundamentally personal relationships, even if one is forged over drinks and gossip and another over coffee and advice.To establish a mentorship: Make yourself not a stranger. I recognize the names of people who regularly comment on my Quora posts, who re-share my Facebook posts, and who re-tweet my tweets. If I feel like youre not just a total stranger, Im more likely to help you.Write well. No text speak or sloppy punctuation. I can absolutely forgive grammatical mistakes caused by being a non-native English speaker. But if youre adding spaces before periods or not capitalizing words (or Capitalizing random Words), thats just being lazy and unprofessional. If youre lazy and unprofessional, Im unlikely to try to help you professionally. Why bother, if youre not doing what you can to help yourself?Get to know them -- in person. An online connection just isnt the same. Make it really, really easy for the other person. Find out where they work or live and meet them nearby. Offer to buy them coffee; its not about the money. Its about establishing that you value their time.Be persistent  but only a little. I get a lot of emails and, much as I wish this werent the case, I dont respond to all of them. If this relationship matters to you, follow up. For the most part, I dont refuse to respond to emails. I just havent yet gotten around to yours yet (and I might never).Make them like you. If possible, do something for them. The vast majority of mentorship requests I get are from people who have read one or more of my books but havent posted a review on Amazon. Look, Im an author. Reviews are a big deal. If you tell me you love my book and youre asking for help from me, Im likely to think, If you love it so much, why not post a review? I recognize Im being a little unfair here  the prospective mentee probably hasnt really thought about posting a review. But, still, Im a lot more likely to help those who I feel are willing to help me. Ill feel a bit indebted to you, Im more likely to help you. In fact, if I even see signs that youre generally a nice and helpful person to other people, Im more likely to help you. I prefer to help nice people.If I know you (even a little), if I feel like youre trying to help yourself, if I feel youre a nice person, and especially if I feel a little obligated, Im a lot more likely to chat with you  especially if you make it really easy for me. We can see where things go from there. We dont need to establish terms and conditions, so please dont ask me to be your mentor.'

S' I got a 750 (out of 800). This is 98th percentile overall, but it\'s only a little above average for MBA programs like Wharton, Stanford, and Harvard. All three have means and medians around 720 - 730 (around 95th percentile).As I recall, I studied for two or three weeks using the booklets from Veritas Prep. Those are great -- definitely recommend them.I took some practice tests by hand. I did not take any computer adaptive tests as practice, which was a mistake. Some advice/comments for those preparing for the GMAT:I loved the Veritas books. My understanding is that they\'re targeted at people who are already scoring fairly well, whereas the other books are more broadly applicable.I didn\'t take a prep class, so I can\'t really speak from personal experience. My understanding is that they\'re great for people who have trouble forcing themselves to study. But if you are self-motivated enough to study, they aren\'t that useful.Take at least one computer adaptive test. I had never taken a computer adaptive before the real GMAT, and it threw me off a bit. The questions get harder the better you\'re doing, so you end up feeling like you\'re doing worse.Take the GMAT well in advance. I took it last minute, so it was my only shot (and fortunately I did well enough that it wouldn\'t hurt me, although it also wouldn\'t really help me). If you give yourself more time, you have the opportunity to retake it. I believe you can "hold on" to your score for up to five years, so you might want to consider taking it after you finish college or between jobs. This will offer you more time to study.Also: if you\'re applying to the top schools, don\'t get too hung up on your score. Focus on getting in the right range, but beyond that it doesn\'t matter that much. It\'s just one very small piece of the package. Your work and other experiences matter far more.'

S' Yes. This is pretty standard practice -- not just for interviews, but for any sort of meeting. The meeting is only truly scheduled when both parties agree to that specific time. When you give a range of times that you\'re available, they cannot reasonably expect you to keep the entire range open. By the time they respond, some of your availability might have changed. Therefore, they need you to reconfirm that this time works.We do the same thing socially:Alex: "Hey, want to grab dinner sometime next week? I\'m free Monday, Tuesday and Thursday." Alex has no particular obligation to keep those nights open, but it\'s nice if Alex can.Pat: "Sure, Monday works."Pat is expected to hold Monday for dinner with Alex -- for a short period of time, until Alex confirms (or not).Alex: "Great, see you then!"Both Pat and Alex are expected to hold Monday for dinner.The event is only really scheduled once Alex has also confirmed. Before then, Pat is somewhat in limbo.Additionally, if Pat specifically asks for a confirmation ("Sure, is Monday good?") then it\'s definitely expected that Alex would need to confirm. This isn\'t redundant. It typically doesn\'t change the situation (since hopefully you are still free at that time), but it does often enough that it serves an important function.'

S' Marissa Mayer doesn\'t and shouldn\'t have to set a good example. But to the extent that she inadvertently does, she actually sets a wonderful example for women by choosing to take only limited leave. She sends a message that not all women are the same, and that babies aren\'t just the women\'s responsibility.Different Input, Different OutputSee, the thing with a choice like how much leave to take: it\'s a personal choice that every mother needs to make for herself. A mother\'s choice will take into account things like:her careerher financial situationher partner\'s careerher desire to care for newbornsher ability to hire or get helpher partner\'s parental leave breastfeeding decisionsher healthher baby\'s healthother children at homeTo impose one person\'s decision on another person\'s, when any or all of these factors are different, is not just unfair; it\'s illogical. Different input leads to different output.It\'s particularly illogical to generalize from Marissa Mayer to all women. She very likely has round the clock help just for the baby, plus additional help for other household things. She makes a lot of money and she\'s in a particularly important role. It\'s ridiculous to act like her decisions reflect anything about the expectations for, say, the typical female software developer who works for her.A Great ExampleIf you do decide to inappropriately hold her up as some sort of example for "all women", then she\'s actually setting a great example. What\'s important for women, for the tech industry, and for the country is sending a message that everyone is different.As a woman -- in tech -- with a young kid and another one on the way, I can say that the expectation is definitely not "oh, you must go back to work ASAP." That\'s the expectation on fathers.We don\'t need another woman sending a message that it\'s okay to not work, permanently or for an extended period of time. That\'s already the norm (at least within highly paid jobs). Society has that message, loud and clear.What the US needs to learn (again, in highly paid jobs) is that you can\'t generalize all women and that, yes, some women can and will go back to work immediately. And that choice is okay.I\'m pregnant, self-employed and have several consulting clients right now. They assume that I\'m not really going to be working for a while after I have my child. Of course they don\'t ask -- it\'s often seen as a no-no topic in the US -- so there\'s just this lingering assumption until I awkwardly bring it up. And that sucks, frankly.By Marissa Mayer taking limited leave, she helps clear the way for people like me who choose to make a similar choice. She makes my clients question their assumption that of course I\'ll take months off. That\'s a great thing because, you know, we\'re all different. And that\'s okay.Babies: Not Just for Women Anymore!Even the fact that we\'re asking this suggests an issue with US culture. How many male CEOs have had kids? Where is the "controversy" around their not taking much leave?People don\'t ask because it\'s assumed that the babies are the mom\'s responsibility. It\'s okay for the dad to not take much time off because, hey, he\'s not really that important, is he? The mom, on the other hand: the babies are for her. They\'re her responsibility, right?That\'s the message that\'s being sent when we create a "controversy" from her personal decisions, and that\'s horrendously unfair to both mothers and fathers. We need to stop denigrating the role of fathers in society and we need to stop assuming that the woman is the "primary" parent.Anyone can be the "primary" parent -- or they can even be equals!But at the end of the day, it\'s her choice.Ultimately, regardless of what "message" she sends, it\'s unfair to expect her to make a choice that is not right for her. It\'s her choice, and it\'s important that we respect that. Women (and minorities) need to have the freedom to make their own choices without being "an example" -- the same freedom we grant to straight, white males.'

I feel like that should reflect "I got pregnant two months ago." However, one could also count from the start of your last period, which is how the number of weeks counts.2. How many weeks are in a month? A lot of people say 4, but this isn\'t true. An average month has 4.35 weeks (365 days / 12 months per year / 7 days per week.With those two definitions agreed upon, this will compute the number of months: # months = (# weeks - 2) / 4.35.Therefore, 34 weeks is 7.36 months pregnant. A different set of assumption could also lead to different answers, such as:7.8 months (if pregnancy starts from the start of the last cycle and there are 4.35 weeks per month)8.5 months (if pregnancy starts from the start of the last cycle and there are 4 weeks per month)8 months (if pregnancy starts from conception and there are 4 weeks per month)Some people might even add a month to each of those, as they might not distinguish between "in the 8th month" and "8 months pregnant".Again, it\'s really a matter of definitions. The 7.36 answer corresponds most directly to how months since you got pregnant, which is logical to me. Some of the others lead to weird things, like saying you\'re 10 months pregnant on your due date.'

S' That\'s an interesting question.First, I\'m not so sure that it\'s true that most adults are unvaccinated. Vaccination isn\'t a binary thing. An adult might have some shots but not all. By contrast, a kid whose parents won\'t vaccinate on principle are likely to have no vaccinations. The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.Second, even if most adults overall are behind on shots, that doesn\'t mean the adults you know are that behind. The adults I know tend to be well-educated and have good access to healthcare. They\'re more likely to have had their shots -- but they still might be refusing the shots for their [perfectly healthy] children, under a mistaken belief that these vaccines are too much for typical child\'s immune system to handle. The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.Third, an adult with insufficient immunity might still have some immunity left. A child with insufficient immunity was probably never immunized at all, and thus has no immunity. The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.Fourth, kids have naturally weaker immune systems. They don\'t have the experience fighting off diseases that adults do. If a kid and an adult were both exposed to the same disease, the kid would be more likely to get sick. The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.Fifth, kids are little Petrie dishes of diseases. They roll around in dirt. They lick tables and other kids\' toys. They touch sticky things just because they\'re lying on the ground. They\'ll pick up anyone\'s drink and drink from it, just because it\'s there. They don\'t have a good sense for "eww, gross!" (they might think plenty of things are gross, but it\'s more likely to be broccoli than the freshly chewed gum on the bench). And they\'re around other kids who are doing the same things. Kids are actually more likely to be exposed to diseases. Adults don\'t generally do this kind of thing. The adult, therefore, is a bit less of a risk.So you see, there are a number of rational reasons to be more concerned about a not-fully-vaccinated child than a not-fully-vaccinated adult.It\'s also worth noting that vaccines are not 100% effective. Your vaccinated child also poses a health risk to the not-fully-vaccinated child, more so than your child does to the not-fully-vaccinated adult. Many people dismiss this under the rationale that they chose to not get vaccinated. But remember: the parent chose that, not the child. And even unvaccinated adults don\'t deserve to die.That said, although the unvaccinated child is more risky than the unvaccinated adult, I suspect there\'s a good amount of "we blame because we can." A parent who doesn\'t vaccinate their child (other than for rare medical reasons) is willfully introducing a health risk to their child and other children, without their consent. Yes, the risk is small when it\'s just isolated incidents of unvaccinated children, but it\'s a stupid risk to take anyway. It also becomes quite a major risk when a larger percent of the population is unvaccinated. People who don\'t vaccinate their children are an easy group to hate, judge, and fear. So while unvaccinated children are riskier than unvaccinated adults, some of the "stay away from them" mentality is probably motivated by the aforementioned inclination to hate, judge and fear them.'

If you understand trees, I could teach you the essentials of a trie in under two minutes.They also come up fairly frequently.

S' Some celebrities are more "mockable" than others, and their costumes reflect this. This doesn\'t mean that the celebrity deserves the mocking; it just means that they have something that others like to mock.A costume of George W. Bush is generally there to mock him. People aren\'t dressing as him out of respect and admiration. They\'re trying to be funny. The costume-wearer will likely be trotting out some of his dumbest quotes.By contrast, a costume of Michael Phelps is not necessarily a "funny" costume. It certainly can be (particularly if the person pretends to be smoking pot), but it\'s very often not.Which camp does Caitlyn Jenner fall into? Will her costume be worn out of respect (or just to make a cool costume) or for the lolz? There are certainly a great number of people who respect her, either for her bravery in coming out or for her athletic accomplishments (or both). There are lots of others who think she\'s disgusting and a sin against nature, or something like that. And there are even more who don\'t really think much about her as a person, so much as a joke.I would strongly suspect that those wearing her costume will be doing it because it\'s funny. What\'s so funny (to them)? That she\'s transgender. That\'s what people are, in most or all cases, making fun of when they dress as her. Making fun of someone who is transgender for being transgender is offensive and hurtful to many people. And from the looks of it, the people who are selling the costume know this. They picked a man to wear the costume -- and a particularly "macho" man. HILARIOUS, right?That\'s not to say that a custom of a transgender celebrity couldn\'t exist respectfully -- or even non-offensively but still not "respectful". If we lived in a time where being transgender wasn\'t a "funny" thing, but just a thing, then absolutely (and we probably will live in this time). Or, if there were a transgender celebrity who just happened to be accepted for this but mocked for something else, then you could have a "funny" costume of him/her that wasn\'t inherently transphobic.Unfortunately, Caitlyn Jenner doesn\'t fall into this category. She\'s most strongly associated with being transgender, and she\'s being mocked for this. That\'s what\'s inspiring this costume. Therefore, it is innately offensive.'

S' I have a very unique first name (and, for my first name, a fairly unique spelling). To some of the older Quorans, it might seem fairly mainstream. It\'s not -- at least not anymore.From Everyone has a name: In 2014, there were just 7 Gayle\'s born and only 13 Gail\'s. Interestingly, Abigail is extremely popular -- it\'s the 8th most common name. Still, people just don\'t like Gayle/Gail.Fine by me. I\'ve really liked having an unusual name. I find that it helps my career in that I can more easily brand myself. It\'s not just that search engines can more easily find me and I can get the usernames I want, although that\'s definitely handy. It\'s also that "Gayle" is sufficiently descriptive to point to me. If you\'re in tech and you hear someone talking about someone named Gayle, it\'s very likely me (or likely enough that you might ask, if you knew me). This would not be true if my name were, say, Sarah.For this reason, I prefer to a more unique name (although with easier spellings) for my children. Unfortunately, it comes with the downside of less anonymity, if that\'s the path one choose. Ah, well.If you\'re really concerned with anonymity, you can look for names that are unique but still have an obvious nickname that\'s common. This way your child can choose to go by this nickname if he/she doesn\'t like having a unique name. For example:Wilson is fairly unique, but your child could go by Will.Johnson is unique, but your child could go by John.Jennette is unique, but your child could go by Jen.Aliana is unique, but your child could go by Ali.Names like this offer "brandability" as the default, but the option of anonymity.'

S' I don\'t know how many babies were negatively affected by it. The number is probably a lot higher than 17, but a lot lower than other countries (as it wasn\'t approved in the U.S.).The articles I\'ve read have hedged a little on the number. They\'ll usually say that only 17 babies were shown to be impacted, which is different than saying only 17 babies were impacted.Note that health and other statistics are typically difficult to compare across countries, as the methodology for reporting and labeling is different. A country with mandatory reporting may have a much statistic, but that doesn\'t mean the true number is higher. Additionally, some countries might be much less likely to link an outcome with a specific cause, whereas others might be pretty comfortable in saying "mom took drug, baby is deformed, therefore, drug caused deformity."'

You ask him to bring you a cup of water.He walks back into the room with one of the following:Nothing at all: this is the null array.An empty cup: this is the empty list case.A cup with water: this is the non-empty list case.Now, case 1 and 2 might feel the same to you (no water for you!), but logically, they are different. An empty cup is obviously not the same thing as no cup at all. They just aren't. One is a cup. One is not.The fact that he brought you an empty cup might signal something different than nothing at all. For example, it might signal that he heard you but you didn't have any water.Depending on what you wanted to do with the water, it might have a very different result. If you wanted to, say, add a drop of red food coloring to the water to make red water, in one case the drop lands on the table and makes a giant mess, and in the other case it lands in a cup.This is the difference between an empty list and no list at all. In some cases it might have the same implications, but in other cases it does not."

S' Many people do tell friends and family their name choice at first -- and then they learn their lesson. Revealing the name in advance can only hurt them. I generally avoid doing things that will only hurt me and won\'t help me; don\'t you?Look, if I tell you my favorite name, one of a few things will happen:You\'ll tell me that you love the name. Whew! But nothing\'s changed now. I don\'t really like the name any more than I did before, nor have you influenced me. I\'m glad that you like it, but this wasn\'t really a value-add exchange of information.You\'ll tell me that it\'s too {common, unusual, hard to spell, easily confused with another name, black, WASPy, hispanic, old-fashioned, trendy}. Um, okay... so you don\'t like my name choice because it\'s unusual, but that\'s part of why I like it. Again, no value-add, but it was value-subtract. Now I know you don\'t like the name.You\'ll tell me that you don\'t like it because that one jerk you know has the same name. That is obviously meaningless in terms of the general quality of the name, but it\'s still a value-subtract. Now I know you don\'t like the name.In other words, your opinion is basically worthless. Your criteria are either stupid or different than mine. So let\'s review. If I tell you the name I\'ve picked, I walk into one of two scenarios:Best case: no change / mild relief. Worst case: walking around with the knowledge that you don\'t like my baby\'s name -- and possibly even turning me off the name enough that I need to choose a new name.It\'s a no-brainer: Keep the name a secret. Only tell those you know will happily lie about how much they like the name.After the baby is born, people are considerably more tactful because, hey, what\'s done is done. They realize it\'s harmful to say they don\'t like the name. So they stay quiet and, often, eventually come to like the name.Note: If someone tells you their name picks, the correct response is "I love it!"'

S' I\'ve helped coach a number of teams through the Google acquisition process (as well as many other companies). It is quite common to require these interviews. It depends on whether it\'s a talent acquisition (acquihire) or a product/user acquisition. The closer it is to a talent acquisition the more likely that Google will interview the team as part of the "technical due diligence" process.This actually makes quite a bit of sense. If they\'re acquiring your company as a way to get engineers, doesn\'t it make sense that they\'d want to assess the quality of those engineers in the same way they hire their own?Employees who underperform in these interviews are not brought on as part of the acquisition ("fired" as you might say, but it\'s not truly being fired).

S' An "unlimited" (within the first year) parental leave policy might not be as good as it sounds.It\'s understandable that people are excited about this. It seems like a good thing. It\'s equal across mothers and fathers; that sends a nice message that babies are not just the woman\'s responsibility. I think all parental leave should be equal. The flexibility offered through it is nice as well, since not every parent wants to leave full-time.However, I\'m deeply concerned about how it will actually play out.From what I\'ve heard, when companies offer "unlimited" vacation or sick leave, employees actually take less time off. The reasoning is that the time isn\'t considered yours, free to spend as you see fit. You also now have to worry about how you\'re perceived. Will taking X weeks off be considered excessive?Facebook, for example, offers four months fully paid to both men and women. That\'s very generous (by US standards, especially for fathers) and it\'s equal. Men and women both know that four months off is absolutely reasonable in the company\'s eyes.Netflix didn\'t state their policy as one-year of parental leave. No. That would be quite different (and very admirable).They say it\'s "unlimited" (within the first year). Now parents need to worry about what\'s truly acceptable. One year might be normal in other countries (where, notably, leave is typically paid for by the government and not by company), but it\'s not normal in the US. You probably won\'t see a lot of people taking one year just because they can, just as you probably don\'t see people at Netflix taking three month vacations under their "unlimited vacation" policy.People have to figure out what\'s acceptable, and that might well mean erring towards the more limited six-week leaves that other companies offer.And, what\'s worse, this might impact men more than women. Many people (erroneously) don\'t feel like men "need" much leave, so men might feel expected to come back to work earlier.Netflix\'s intention was likely quite good, especially as this is inline with how they offer vacation and sick leave. However, the actual impact might be quite bad.It\'d be far more powerful if they had explained the policy as one-year of leave, for men and women. That\'s technically the same thing, but sends a very different message.'

S' A lot of people value uniqueness in a name. There can be several reasons for this, including:Emotional: My kid is so special that I want him/her to have a special name. He/she shouldn\'t be just like all the other kids.Practical: It\'s annoying to be one of five Johns in your class. Many parents don\'t want to put their kids through that. Strategic: Some believe it\'s beneficial for your career to have a unique name. It\'s believed (by them) to be easier to make a name for yourself if your name is actually unique.Many are relating to their own experiences in this. For my kids, I prefer names that are unique but easy to say and spell. Why? Because I like that my name is very unique, but the unique spelling is annoying. So that\'s what I pick names based on. I want a name that\'s uncommon enough that he\'d rarely meet anyone with that name, but still easy to spell and sounds like a normal name.Interestingly, if you listen to what people complain about with these "unique" names, it\'s often not about uniqueness or spelling or even newness.Uniqueness: Nevaeh was the 65th most common name, and it\'s was as high as 25 a few years ago. (A comparison point: in 1985, the 65th most common name was Catherine, with Cynthia at #66.)Spelling: Precious is very easy to spell. So is Apple.Newness: Hudson doesn\'t get nearly so much hate. And yet, it\'s quite a new name and very "trendy."Know what name is unique and hard to spell? Gayle. There were just 7 Gayle\'s born in 2014 in the US (and 13 Gail\'s). You think that\'s a ridiculous name too, right? Oh. You don\'t. (You probably just think it\'s old sounding.)So, what is the real objection here? Why do these names seem weird? Because:You\'re not a baby. They were weird 20+ years ago, but that doesn\'t mean they\'re weird now. The names just seem so... black. Very often, the names that people complain about are ones that are associated with black people. Names with equivalent popularity/trends that aren\'t "black names" don\'t get nearly as much hatred. (You might not have been consciously thinking this -- I doubt you were. But I\'ll bet if you presented people with two equally popular names and with equal trends, one that sounds "black" and one that sounds "WASPy", they\'ll much prefer the WASPy one.)To summarize: Many people value uniqueness in a name, for a variety of justifiable (and some silly) reasons. Others look down on those choices, especially when it doesn\'t match their age/racial culture.'

Lack of access to contraception.Contraception failing.Rape and/or abuse.Being told that you\'re infertile.Using contraception incorrectly.In addition, there are reasons why someone might want an abortion, even in a planned pregnancy (for example, fetal and maternal issues).These things happen, but let\'s be honest. The number one reason for an unplanned pregnancy that leads to an abortion is just people being irresponsible by not using contraception and then deciding they don\'t want kids.Should they be able to access abortions, despite their stupidity? Why on earth not?Pregnancy is hard -- really hard. It sucks even when you want to have a kid, and I can\'t imagine how much worse it\'d be if you don\'t want to. Raising a child (or giving up a child up for adoption) is even harder. These are not reasonable "punishments" for a couple\'s irresponsibility.

S' While I understand where you\'re coming from, no, it\'s not re-writing history. In fact, it\'d be frankly weird to not update the pronouns. This is essentially how we handle everything else. People say "Gayle McDowell worked at Google". But McDowell is my married name, and I was "Gayle Laakmann" the entire time I was at Google.Someone might say "I met my husband at my friend\'s 25th birthday party," but at the time he wasn\'t her/his husband. Names and pronouns are just "pointers" to the person. They typically reflect the current name and pronoun, not the name or pronoun at the time. I am not inherently Gayle McDowell; I am me and people happen to refer to me as Gayle McDowell.Convention is to use the current pointer, not the then-pointer (probably because the pointer is designed to be useful, and using an out-of-date one isn\'t so useful). It\'d be quite strange to break from convention specifically to use a transgender person\'s "original" sex.Additionally, for many transgender people, their original name/pronoun reflects a painful time in their life. They might not want to be reminding of this time themselves. They might also not want to "out" themselves to others.Given that convention is to use the original pointer and the pain it would cause to not, it seems pretty evident that we should use the current pronoun.Of course, if a specific transgender person has a different preference, go with that. Even if it doesn\'t fit the "standard." This impacts them far more than you.'

S' Obviously I applied topological sort to a graph of the dependencies across sections and chapters.First, there was the decision about which chapters and sections to include. Second, I had to draw a directed graph and connected nodes where one should be discussed before the other, either due to a dependency in the material or a difference in complexity. Third, I applied a simple topological sort to determine a linear ordering. There\'s some randomness to it too.Sections"Introductory Material" obviously needs to be before anything else."Solutions" obviously needs to be after the questions themselves. "Data Structures" needs to be before "Algorithms", since they\'re less complex and the algorithm questions often depend on knowledge of data structures."Assorted Review Problems" needs to be after all the other questions.So you get this graph for the sections:Applying a topological sort to this, you get the order in the book.ChaptersWithin Data Structures, "Arrays" needs to be before anything else, as it\'s the most fundamental. It makes sense to me to discuss linked lists before stacks and queues or trees, since linked lists are more basic than either of those.Within "Algorithms", there isn\'t a lot of dependency. "Recursion and Dynamic Programming" should be before "Sorting", since sorting uses recursion.Within "Knowledge Based", C++ and Java should be discussed adjacent to each other and before Databases.Within "Assorted Review Problems", moderate problems should obviously be discussed before hard problems.So then I just applied a straightforward topological sort to get a linear ordering.I presume this is the standard algorithm for all authors to decide chapter ordering... right?Okay, fine, I didn\'t really draw this out. But something like this was roughly in my head. Certain topics were dependent on others, and certain topics were just less complex and should be discussed earlier. A lot of chapters, especially within algorithms, could be discussed in any order.'

S' The design is important to the extent that it affects the ability to easily grab the highlights and other essential content from your resume. Few recruiters would judge you (at least consciously) on the design of your resume, unless design skills are important for your job function.As far as the "CareerCup template": there\'s nothing special about it. It\'s just a boring, normal template. It\'s designed to be able to fit a good amount of content on it and to make it easy to see the key details (job titles, companies, etc). It was right for me. It might not be right for you.I dislike templates for me with my experience which use the entire left column to just have headlines like "EXPERIENCE" and "EDUCATION". Sure, it looks pretty. But it wastes so much space.I dislike templates for me with my experience which don\'t adequately highlight the company names. My resume highlight was company names. I needed reviewers to be able to skim my resume and say, "Wow, she worked at Microsoft and Apple. Let\'s interview her." Frankly, that\'s really all I needed to land any interview. That\'s probably not your situation though. If your company names actually reflect poorly on you, then you might want to hide your company names and instead highlight your job titles. Formatting like item below is harmful to me but potentially beneficial to you.Software Engineer, Company Name (City, ST), June 2010 - June 2015I don\'t care if a template includes the cities of each job. Many people needs this in their resume. I didn\'t.I don\'t want to highlight specific skills (languages, software, etc), but it does need to be on my resume somewhere.I wanted a one page resume. Short resumes help the highlights jump out. Long resumes end up with some great things pushed to the next page, or just lost in a bunch of other weaker items.So these were (some of) the criteria used to design this: This is what a GOOD resume should look likeIt\'s an okay template for many people, but there\'s nothing special about it. It\'s just a normal, boring template. It was designed to fit my needs. Those probably aren\'t the same as yours, but they might be close enough. Or not.The major thing you should ask it what the selling points of your experience is. Pick a few things that you think will be the keys to landing an interview. Is it a job title? A company you worked for? A project? An award? Your school? Pick a template that allows those to stand out on your resume.'

Is this a good question?I can\'t really comment on the problem as it\'s not clear what the problem means.Many people have interpreted the problem to mean flipping left and right. In this case, it\'s a pretty uninteresting trivial problem. It\'s a bad question, unless maybe early on in the process, because it doesn\'t really demonstrate much. It\'s easy. (And I would be somewhat concerned about someone who couldn\'t do it.)However, the OP later says that it was "to min-max a tree, ascending to descending". I don\'t really understand what this means. Max Howell on Twitter2. Was he rejected because of this question?It\'s also unclear why he was rejected. Was he specifically told that he was rejected because he couldn\'t invert a binary tree on the whiteboard? If he had multiple interviews (which is likely, since he was brought onsite), does he know that it was that interview that led to his rejection? If he did know it was that interview, how does he know why he was rejected? Usually recruiters don\'t provide that information.Perhaps it had nothing to do with his technical performance and was in fact his communication skills.In my experience, a candidate\'s assumptions about their performance has no correlation with their actual performance. He might have very strong beliefs about why he was rejected, but unless he was specifically told, I don\'t really put much faith in it.3. Why was he rejected?If it was his technical performance on this question that led to his rejection, it\'s still not quite true that he was rejected because he simply "can\'t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard."Interviews aren\'t graded on a binary basis. It\'s not like, "Oops, you can\'t do X, so I\'m going to reject you."More accurately, if it was this interview question that led to his rejection, he was rejected because he performed worse on this question relative to other candidates. That is, other candidates who tackled the same problem with the same interviewer demonstrated stronger problem-solving/coding skills than he did. It\'s very much feasible to perform better than other candidates on this problem (whatever it is). He just didn\'t.4. Was he a false negative?Yes, the interview process is flawed. There are false positive (bad candidates who are accepted) and there are false negatives (good candidates who are rejected).Was he a false negative? We don\'t really know. Maybe. He\'s certainly done some excellent work, but that doesn\'t mean he would perform well in Google\'s environment. Just because you\'re great in one environment doesn\'t mean you\'ll perform well in all.5. Should you hire on past experience?You might argue that, despite poor performance (relative to other candidates), he should still be hired because of his prior experience. I\'m somewhat sympathetic to that view, but it can also present a dangerous slippery slope. How widely do you start making exceptions because someone has great prior experience? How do you roll out such a policy at a large company without letting the bar slip to more marginal cases?It\'s worth noting that, in the vast majority of cases, you can\'t hire based on someone\'s prior experience. You can only hire based on how someone discusses it. It\'s hugely subjective and very coachable. In a "hire on prior experience" process:There are lots of false negatives because candidates don\'t know how to discuss their prior experience. There are lots of false positive because candidates are able to trump up (sometimes even lie) about what they\'ve done in the past.There are lots of people who are brilliant and would do great work given the right opportunities and mentorship, but haven\'t gotten that opportunity yet. Google\'s process can identify those people. Many people don\'t classify those situations as a false negatives since those people haven\'t in fact accomplished much. I think that\'s a mistake. You care about what they\'ll do for you, not what they\'ve done in the past.It\'s also circular logic, since it\'s saying that hiring based on prior experience justifies rejecting based on a lack of it. If so, then doesn\'t hiring based on whiteboard problem-solving skills justify rejecting based on lack of those?Hiring based on prior experience comes with its own set of issues (and its own advantages).6. Does it work for Google?As far as if it works for Google: well, let\'s look at it this way. Virtually every "elite" tech company (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Airbnb, Dropbox, Palantir, etc.) has built its team of software engineers through this process. Unless you\'re going to argue that a randomly selected group of programmers could have built systems like the ones at those companies, the interview process can\'t be that bad. Somehow, it\'s selecting reasonably good people, even if it rejects some good people and hires some bad ones (and even if there\'s a better way of doing it).This is not to say that Google\'s process is perfect. It\'s not. But all interview processes are broken in their own ways. The key is to find the one that\'s least broken for your company.Developer Interviews are Broken, and You Can\'t Fix It'

S' "Shameful"? Yikes!Even so: No, it won\'t be released on the same day. It\'s not really possible.The way that the book is printed in India is different from the US. In order to make the book affordable in India prices, I have to do bulk print runs. It takes time -- an unpredictable amount of time -- to get that ramped up. The printer also isn\'t quite as tightly integrated with Amazon and Flipkart (through no fault of theirs). That also causes a delay as books have to actually be shipped to a warehouse.By contrast, in the US, when I say "go", it\'s available that day or the next day.I suppose I could just arbitrarily hold up the US release until it\'s released in India, but that doesn\'t help anyone.'

S" I've definitely heard (frequently) of interviewers selecting questions from Cracking the Coding Interview.However, they shouldn't. When I do interviewing training, I specifically tell companies not to.First, questions in the book are there not because they're necessarily good questions, but because they're useful for candidates to prepare with. The correlation between is strong, but not perfect. For example, brainteasers are in the book even though I don't recommend asking them.Second, and much more importantly, it's stupid to ask questions from the same book that candidates are largely using. The point of problem-solving questions is to see how candidates solve new problems that they haven't seen before."

I set a list price on Amazon, but then Amazon can (and does) arbitrarily drop the price.The list price for the 5th edition is $39.95, but Amazon sells it for $30.05 (right now).The list price for the 6th edition (on pre-order right now) is $39.95, but Amazon has just dropped the price to $27.64. I don\'t have any control over this; it just happens.So in other words, the price could be anything from $21 to $40 at any given point.

S" I typically vote as a democrat. More specifically:I lean much more strongly democrat on most social issues (gay rights, transgender rights, black and minority rights, women's rights, gun rights, healthcare, immigration, religious involvement in politics, assisted suicide, etc).I think the increasing disparity between the wealthy and poor is problematic. I'm concerned about the shrinking middle class. Democrats seem more focused on this issue. I somewhat side with republicans on some economic ideas (for example, the value of being fiscally conservative), but I don't think they have actually executed effectively on this.While democrats have elected their share of stupid people, Republicans seem to take the cake here. Their adherence to religion probably has something to do with it. (This is not at all saying that religious people are stupid. It's that screaming the loudest about God seems to be a winning strategy for Republicans. That's taking the focus off more important things, like good decision making.)To put this another way: I'm somewhat torn between the two sides. I could be willing to go against my values and vote republican if there were very strong evidence that Republicans were better for the economy (after all, the economy also has life and death impact for people). But that evidence isn't there yet, and thus I would generally vote democrat."

S" When I was in college, I TAd for a freshman/sophomore level computer science class. All the TAs were prior students in the class. We had by far the best set of TAs in the Computer Science department.Is that surprising? We surely had much less experience than the other TAs, who were usually PhD students. We didn't have the expertise in the subject area that the PhD students had.But here's the thing: We were great teachers. We were selected not because we were knowledgable in the material (although we had to of course do reasonably well in the class), but because we could effectively communicate it.They knew we could effectively communicate it because they'd just spent a year interacting with us and watching how we communicate. That's so much better than an interview.We'd just taken the class, so we knew what people struggled with. We could communicate it at their level because we were still at their level. We wouldn't try to explain things with concepts beyond their understanding.When a true subject-matter expert teaches something, he/she often communicates in a way that is too complex.You want your teachers to be great teachers, first and foremost. Experts absolutely have their role. You need an expert to set up the curriculum and to tackle some of the more difficult questions. But you don't need to be taught by experts at all times.I don't think it's that different at a coding bootcamp. You certainly want experts to be very involved. But prior students who really stood out in their communication skills could make excellent teachers. They can communicate the complex topics in a way that might just make more sense to a current student."

S' I think what\'s disrespectful is to presume, with zero knowledge of the parent or child or situation, that we know better than them. Here\'s the entirety of our knowledge:Someone had a bumper sticker that said "Please be patient, autistic child on board."That\'s it. We presume that this was on a car. We presume that this was the parent. We presume that the kid doesn\'t want their condition known. We presume that the kid is able to even understand what this bumper sticker says. We presume that this was done with no reasonable justification. We presume that we know better although we know nearly nothing.Try this: When you see a parent doing something that you don\'t get, ask yourself, "Is there a plausible explanation for this behavior?"For pretty much anyone with kids, someone could look at a parenting choice and say that it\'s a bad one. Usually, when you know the situation though, it seems a lot more reasonable.Two examples from my personal experience:For much of my child\'s life, I\'ve carefully tracked his calories. I don\'t give him food just because he asks for it. I ration food that many parents would consider fairly healthy (eggs, whole wheat bread, milk, fruit, etc).The parenting books say that you should let your kid eat whenever they\'re hungry and that those are healthy choices. Kids know how to control their appetite. Yes, that\'s true in most situations. Lots of people have told me that I don\'t need to worry so much about what my kid eats.But my kid will overeat into obesity and those foods, while healthy in many respects, are very high in calories.I have a friend who really pushes her kid to eat. She\'s practically force-feeding her kid. That\'s a big no-no in the parenting books. But her kid will, if left to his own, eat so little that he\'ll be unhealthily skinny and deprived of sufficient calories to grow healthy.We don\'t know what is going on in this situation, but I can certainly imagine situations where it\'d be better to disclose this child\'s autism publicly than to not. Perhaps it makes other people more tolerant of the child\'s situation and less likely to do things that upset the child (honking, yelling, etc). Perhaps this parent tends to have trouble getting the child in and out of parking spots. Perhaps this is a vehicle used to transport severely autistic children and, again, they got a lot of hassle before putting this on.Remember that when you ask if a parent should do something, the question is about that parent, not all or even most parents. Most parents shouldn\'t ration food, but we should. Most parents shouldn\'t force-feed their kids, but my friend should. Most parents shouldn\'t use such a bumper sticker, but this parent -- if it even is a parent -- quite possibly should. The parent did this for a reason, remember. Why assume they\'re wrong when we know absolutely nothing?Give people the benefit of the doubt. Don\'t be so judgmental about other people\'s choices.'

S' Yes, it is in the works. It should be released June or July 2015. You can sign up to be notified (or just find out more details) at Cracking the Coding Interview, v6 | Coming SoonWhen I wrote the 5th edition about four years ago, I had a ton of interview experience but not as much coaching experience. Now, particularly through doing acquisition/acquihire coaching, I have a lot more. And, I have more experience with coaching the same people repeatedly. I have developed a bunch of new techniques and have been able to refine them by seeing what really works. This has motivated a lot of the changes.What\'s new?This is a huge expansion. You know that thing that many professors do, where they create a new "edition" that\'s not substantially different but forces you to buy a new version? I don\'t believe in doing that. This is actually a huge change (as was the 4th->5th edition).Some of the biggest changes:It\'s about 70% longer. The 5th edition was 500 pages. The 6th is (well, was) about 850. I actually hit the printing limit (800 pages), so I had to change the page size. (It\'s like college all over again...)It has 39 more problems. I took out a few problems I didn\'t really like, so there are probably more like 45 more problems.Hints! I\'m really excited about this. I think this will be incredibly valuable. It will help you simulate the interview experience more and develop better techniques, since interviewers give you hints too. Each problem has an average of 5 or so hints (2 or 3 for some of the easiest problems), and more than 10 for some of the hardest. The hints for each problem are incremental. Try to solve the problems without the hints, but if you need them--use as few as possible. New strategies / techniques. I\'ve done a lot of interview coaching over the past two or three years. There are a lot of trends and techniques that I see now that I never noticed before. They\'ve even helped me to solve some of the harder problems. :)Lots of Big O. When I wrote the 5th edition, I don\'t think I realized how many people struggled with big O. Turns out... the vast majority of candidates don\'t understand it well enough for an interview (even those who think they do). I have a huge section on big O now. In addition, many of the existing problems have been reworked or rewritten - fixing errors in some cases, clarifying things, adding new solutions/approaches, etc.Programming LanguageI have continued to use Java for this book for a few reasons. First, Java is more widely readable than Python. Pretty much everyone has written Java or a language much like it. Second, while I love Python as a language because it makes some things so easy (for example, doing a quick map or reduce), that makes solutions in Python a little less broadly applicable. I want this book to be as language agnostic as possible. The point is the algorithms, not the code.Third, for the purposes of this book, having explicit typing makes it easier for people to understand what\'s going on. It removes some of the ambiguity when reading written code. However, you can view or contribute solutions in other languages at gaylemcd/ctci.'

S' Your mom might not be going about it the right way (or maybe she is--we don\'t really know), but either way she has a point. I would encourage you to not brush it off entirely.Whether you like it or not, attractiveness makes your life easier. You\'ll make friends easier. People will think you\'re smarter. Teachers and strangers will like you more. You\'ll get treated better.These aren\'t just little things about how people see you. These are very real. Your friendships matter. Your grades matter. Your career matters. All of things come a bit easier when you\'re attractive and know how to put yourself together well.You\'re writing off caring about your appearance as superficial, but... is all this superficial? Having friends? Grades? Career? Certainly many people go to excess here and care too much about their appearance. People can also care too much about their grades or too much about making friends. The fact that some people over focus isn\'t a reason to not care.What concerns me with your attitude is that you\'re just saying it doesn\'t matter to you, and I\'m not sure you\'ve thought through the implications of this. Additionally, given your age, there could be other factors at play. Perhaps you say you don\'t care about your appearance because you think it\'s hopeless. Or perhaps you think it takes too much effort. Or perhaps you don\'t want to enter into competition with your sisters. Or perhaps you want to feel superior over others and call them superficial.As I said, there\'s a lot of value in knowing how to put yourself together well. I would encourage you to find a way that works for you. Perhaps drop the sweatpants for stretchy skinny jeans (which can be much more comfortable, surprisingly, than normal jeans). Find some comfortable but fitted tops. Find makeup that works for your skin, even if you don\'t wear it everyday.If you do decide that you really don\'t want to care about your appearance, recognize what you\'re giving up. You\'re giving up something that will help you in many parts of life. It\'s okay to not leverage that advantage, just like it\'s okay to not leverage your network for a job search and it\'s okay to not work hard in school. You don\'t always have to take the "smart" path.Just make your decisions for you (not to spite anyone else) and with a full understanding of the consequences.'

S' Let\'s look at this from several aspects: correctness, readability, and style.CorrectnessIt\'s not actually technically correct. It\'s close and would only require minor tweaks to fix.First, you\'ve implemented this extra little bit that isn\'t in the problem. If there\'s only one character of a particular type, you just insert that character (instead of the character + the frequency). That\'s actually not the assignment.Second, the problem requires that if the compressed string would be longer than the original string, you should return the original string. You haven\'t done this. This is the primary reason why the book\'s code is "longer": it\'s actually solving a different problem. If you strip this part out of the book\'s code, it\'s actually shorter and simpler than your code.If you make this change, there are two ways of doing it. You could check in advance (and save yourself the memory usage) or you can check after you\'ve done the compression. You can debate which approach is better, and it depends on what assumptions you have. The book checks in advance, on the reasoning that if you really need to compress a string, then you potentially throwing long strings at it. It\'s nice to save yourself the memory usage.(Additionally, if your interviewer adds this constraint to the problem, then they may be looking for something beyond just throwing in an if-statement at the end.)ReadabilityYou\'ve used nested loops where the inner loop modifies the outer loop. Yuck. It makes it look like you have an O(N^2) algorithm, even when you don\'t, and makes the flow of the program confusing.If you are going to do this, I\'d actually rather you use not use "i" as the iterating variable on the loops. People usually use "i" when it\'s something very straightforward, like just looping through this. It has an implication of "ignore this variable -- it\'s not terribly important." Something like "index" would probably be better here.Avoid that when possible -- and it\'s definitely possible here. You can do this with just one linear loop forward. That\'s how the code in the book works.Style & other minor issuesFix your spacing. There should be a space after "for", "while", and "if".Be consistent. You can debate whether or not you should have spaces around comparisons (equals, less than, etc), although virtually every style guideline I\'m aware of requires them. But if you really argue that you don\'t want them, then you should be consistent here. You have spaces sometimes, but not always ("i<input.length();").You declare the StringBuffer in the beginning, but then you have a (potential) return right after it. Why not just put the StringBuffer declaration after it?There\'s no reason to have the bulk of your code wrapped within an else statement. It\'s okay to do one-line if statements (actually, I don\'t love them, but I use them in the book for compactness), but don\'t mix a one-line if statement with a multiline else block.The first if-statement is actually totally unnecessary. I\'d take it out.Given that you\'re using a StringBuffer, I don\'t see the benefit of concatenating a string first and then inserting the string. That will create a new string. I would just add the strings individually.Clean up time!First, I\'ll fix the style issues. I\'m also going to put opening braces on the same line. This is my personal preference and the style that both Google and Facebook use. It\'s very much just personal preference; don\'t let anyone tell you it\'s bad to do otherwise. 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\nString compress(String input) { StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer(); for (int index = 0; index < input.length(); index++) { char curr = input.charAt(index); int frequency = 0; // keep incrementing frequency while the character is the same as the current one while (index < input.length() && input.charAt(index) == curr) { index++; frequency++; }  // decrement index so no character is missed index--;  result.append(curr); if (frequency > 1) { result.append(frequency); } } return result.toString();}Getting better already!Now, let\'s fix the correctness issues. 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\nString compress(String input) { StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer(); for (int index = 0; index < input.length(); index++) {  char curr = input.charAt(index); int frequency = 0; // keep incrementing frequency while the character is the same as the current one while (index < input.length() && input.charAt(index) == curr) { index++; frequency++; }  // decrement index so no character is missed index--;  result.append(curr); result.append(frequency); } return result.length() < input.length() ? result.toString() : input;}That wasn\'t so hard.Now, let\'s fix the readability issue with the nested loops. 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\nString compress(String input) { StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer(); int frequency = 1; char previous = input.charAt(0); for (int i = 1; i < input.length(); i++) { if (input.charAt(i) == previous) { frequency++; } else { result.append(input.charAt(i - 1)); result.append(frequency); previous = input.charAt(i); frequency = 1; } } result.append(previous); result.append(frequency); return result.length() < input.length() ? result.toString() : input;}If you want to, you can remove the usage of the "previous" variable above. It\'s not actually strictly necessary. You can also look forward instead of backward: 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\nString compress(String input) { StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer(); int frequency = 0; for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) { frequency++; if (i + 1 >= input.length() || input.charAt(i) != input.charAt(i + 1)) { result.append(input.charAt(i)); result.append(frequency); frequency = 0; } } return result.length() < input.length() ? result.toString() : input;}In either case, this now looks an awful lot like what\'s in the book.'

S" It depends on how core that built-in library is to the essence of the question. Generally, you shouldn't replace the essence of the interview question with a built-in library. So writing array.sort() when I ask you to sort an array would be defeating the point of the problem (which is to see how elegant your code is).But, if your solution merely relied on the array being sorted but it wasn't really the point of the question, then please do use the built-in library.That said, it's sort of an irrelevant question. If you're approaching questions the right way, then this doesn't really come up as an issue.First, you should be discussing the problem with your interviewer before you start coding. You shouldn't just code as soon as you think you have a solution to the problem. This would be the point to mention that there's a built-in library that handles the problem.Second, when you code, you should approach it top-down, not bottom-up. Start with the most high level function and then fill in the details as you go. This ensures that you get the most important algorithmic parts done first. If you do things this way, it won't really matter whether or not you can use the built-in library functions. Use them--and make up your own functions as you need. You can fill in the details as you have time."

S' No, certainly not.Let\'s make sure we\'re very clear on this point (because a lot of people don\'t really get this). The letter "n" is in O(n) is a variable that has a specific meaning. It\'s not a magic letter used for runtimes.An example: is inserting a value in a balanced binary search tree O(N) or O(log N)? Both are valid answers; it depends what N means.If N reflects the number of nodes in the tree, then insertion takes O(log N).If N reflects the depth of the tree, then insertion takes O(N).When someone something like "binary search in an array is O(log N)", they\'re being slightly imprecise. We all know that they mean that N is the size of the array (what else could it mean?), so we don\'t get too bothered by it. But technically, they should define the meaning of N.Given this, nested for loops are not necessarily O(N^2). Here are some examples:Example 1: O(A*W) and/or O(N)This code counts the number of a\'s in an array of words.1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\narray = array of words (where all words have the same length)count_of_As = 0for each word in array: for each character in word: if character == \'a\': count_of_As += 1This is an O(A * W), where A is the length of the array and W is length of each word. You could, however, say it\'s O(N), where N is the number of characters in all the words, combined.You absolutely cannot say that it\'s O(N^2), because what would N mean? (Okay, there are some bizarre things you could define N to be. For example, if you defined N to be the square root of the number of characters in all the words. That\'d be a very strange definition of N.)Example 2: O(N^4)This code builds a string of pairs of elements.1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\narray = array of charactersstr = ""for x in array: for y in array: pair_to_string = "(" + x + ", " + y + ")" str += pair_to_stringLots of people will want to say this is O(N^2), where N is the length of the array. Not so.Concatenating K characters together (naively, in most languages) actually takes O(K^2) time. A very simple explanation of this is that you\'re continuously creating a new string. The first time you create a string of size 1, then size 2, then size 3, then size 4. The total number of characters allocated O(K^2), which will take O(K^2) time.(I\'m excluding times when the compiler might do some optimization, which is possible, or when the language does something fancier. This is a simple, naive example.)So if concatenating K characters together is K^2 time, then concatenating N^2 small strings together will be O((N^2)^2) time, or O(N^4).Example 3: O(N)This code counts the number of sequences of 5 characters that are the same.1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\narray = array of intscount_5_the_same = 0for i from 0 to array.length - 4: all_the_same = true for j = i + 1 to i + 4: if array[i] != array[j]: all_the_same = false if all_the_same: count_5_the_same += 1This code takes O(N) time, where N is the length of the array.Example 4: O(N^2 log N)This code counts how many times the product of two integers within a sorted array is within the array. 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\narray = array of intscount_product_occurrences = 0for x in array: for y in array: product = x * y if binary_search(array, product): count_product_occurrences += 1This code will take O(N^2 log N) time. That\'s because the for loops go through O(N^2) iterations, and each iteration does an O(log N) search.There are an infinite number of examples like this. Perhaps you feel like these examples are cheating or bending the rules of the question. Maybe... if you define the question to be as follows: Are all nested for loops O(N^2) where:The outer for loop iterates O(N) timesThe inner for loop iterates O(N) times, for each iteration of the for loopThe outer for loop only does O(1) work, other than the inner for loopThe inner for loop only does O(1) work.In that case, yes, those should be all O(N^2). (Or at least, I can\'t think of any counter examples, but it\'s possible I\'m missing some additional qualifications.)The important take-away here is to realize that nothing is ever inherently O(N) or O(N^2). N is just a variable and it always has a very specific meaning (although sometimes we infer what it is). Big O is just an equation of variables that reflects the runtime. That equation can be anything and can use any variables.In fact, if you\'re struggling even a little bit with big O (and even if you\'re not, this can\'t hurt): just stop using N as a variable in big O. Seriously. Use logical variable names instead that reflect their meaning.Too many people say "O(N)" when they really mean "linear". Well, linear in what? If you have an array of [equal-length] strings, it\'s really not clear whether your "N" refers to the array or the string length, or something else. Avoiding N as a variable name will prevent you from making a stupid mistake like this: Sorting a string takes O(N log N) time. So if you have an array of strings and you want to sort all of them, it takes O(N*N log N). Uh... nope. Different Ns. Try again, using S for the string length and A for array length.'

S' As I understand it, the connection you\'re making is this: a boy being sexually abused and then turning out to be gay indicates that sexual orientation can be changed. Therefore, since it can be changed, we shouldn\'t oppose "gay conversion therapies."This is misguided on a number of levels.A data point of 1. Many boys being abused wind up being straight too. So finding out an abused boy is gay indicates nothing about how changeable sexual orientation is.Gay conversion therapy is opposed because it\'s harmful, not because it\'s ineffective. Gay conversation therapies aren\'t opposed because they\'re ineffective. Many things are ineffective yet don\'t earn the amount of hatred that conversion therapies do. Gay conversion therapy is despised because it\'s harmful and often done on a child without their consent, during a particularly vulnerable point in their life. We should oppose this even if it did sometimes work, or even if it could potentially works. Being gay isn\'t harmful.Additionally, it\'s worth noting that gay conversion therapy presumably -- hopefully -- doesn\'t operate via sexual abuse. Nor should it. So even if sexual abuse were found to "change" someone\'s sexual orientation, that doesn\'t mean that the current gay conversation therapy would work.Correlation doesn\'t imply causation.Let\'s suppose that there\'s a correlation between being sexually abused and being gay. Does this indicate anything about sexual orientation being changeable? No.Boys and girls realize they\'re gay at different times in life. Many report always knowing that they\'re "different", and some report knowing that they\'re gay from a young age (7ish in some cases). Being different makes kids feel vulnerable. Not just feel vulnerable, but be vulnerable. They\'re often isolated from their peers and scared of their friends and family finding out their secret. Child abusers are sickly drawn to this sort of vulnerability. If gay people are more likely to have been abused at a younger age, the causal direction is very likely the other way around.'

The algorithm doesn\'t realize that it\'s not on sale because a newer, better version is. It doesn\'t realize that it should compare the price to that item and, if anything, be lower.The 5th edition is the latest edition and is a reasonable 530 rupees.

S' He should regret it. He should not have rescinded the offer publicly. In fact, nearly every part of this was wrong: objecting so strongly to the candidate\'s actions, actually rescinding the offer, and doing so publicly.1. He should not have rescinded the offer publicly.This is a private matter between the company and the candidate. It\'s not okay to disclose this publicly.2. He should not have actually rescinded the offer, when he could have just politely discouraged the candidate from joining.Instead of actually rescinding the offer, he could have gotten on the phone with the candidate and said something like this:I saw your post and you\'re still welcome here. However, I think you should join Uber instead. You want name brand, and they have that more so than us. The money differences are irrelevant in the long run. Don\'t make the decision based on that. It\'s so much more important to go somewhere you are excited to be. And if that\'s Uber, go for it. You can\'t go wrong.And so on.It probably would have worked. The candidate probably would have taken the Uber job. The CEO accomplishes the same thing, but now looks super mature, professional, and empathic. Right now, he basically looks like the opposite.If I\'m wrong and the candidate joined Zenefits anyway, then isn\'t that what he wants?3. He should not have been so offended by the candidate\'s actions.So the candidate sees name brand as a "plus." Um, so? Who doesn\'t see that as a plus?If he thinks that most other candidates don\'t want the same thing, he\'s incredibly naive. This is especially true when hiring out of college. Of course they\'re going to think about long-term career options.I really don\'t see what\'s so offensive in this candidate\'s actions. He posted an anonymous question looking for career advice. Who cares? Nothing he said was even particularly negative about Zenefits.The Zenefits CEO made himself look like a jerk. I knew nothing about the Zenefits CEO prior to this, and I really don\'t think it\'s fair to generalize from a single action. But other people will. He looks naive: he\'s unaware that name brand is a factor in most people\'s decisions. There was nothing unique in this candidate\'s thought process.He looks immature and arrogant: he buys wholeheartedly into his mission, so he expects everyone else to -- even people who haven\'t joined.He looks like he\'s dodging responsibility: rather than accepting that he/his company might not have adequately sold the vision, he blames the candidate for not buying in sufficiently.He looks unempathetic: he\'s unable to look at it from the candidate\'s perspective and see that the candidate is being reasonable.He looks callous: revoking the offer, and doing so publicly, was mean.He looks unprofessional: there were much better ways of handling this situation, as I\'ve explained here. Now, I\'m not saying he is these things. I don\'t know much about him and I\'m not going to generalize off of one incident. Maybe this is a weak point for him, or maybe this just caught him on a bad day. He\'s human too, and even CEOs of A-list startups make mistakes.But to people quicker to judge, he looks like all of these things. That\'s why this was such a stupid move.Also, can I just say... when it\'s you vs the Uber CEO, and you are the one looking like a jerk, you know you screwed up.'

S' The question asks "Why are people showing support or sympathy for Salman Khan?", but most answers here instead seem to be giving reasons for not sympathizing with Salman, and not addressing why there is such a huge outpouring of sympathy for him. Inasmuch that he did something irresponsible that directly led to the death of a person and crippling of others, the court has found him guilty.However, sympathy isn\'t always rationally calculated after weighing all pros and cons and their expected utilities. It\'s typically a much more visceral reaction. Likewise, hatred or lack of sympathy is often almost equally visceral, and can be vicious and unreasoned. There are a lot of loosely independent sources which can give rise to sympathy or support for Salman Khan. Needless to say, this is said not in his defense, but is intended to be an attempt at analyzing why people behave the way they do.Let\'s look at some of them. Fan base: His fan base loves him, and like a lot of loyal fans, is sticking with him in times of distress. Its important to highlight here that Salman Khan has an exceptional fan following who fondly call him "bhai", the ultimate big brother; even the fandom SRK enjoys abroad pales in comparison. Thats the closest Bollywood gets to a Rajnikanth. His hard core fans are his extended family and so their sympathy is largely based on emotion and sentiment: the kind you would expect from your close friends and family (See Point 3).The nature of the crime: Many people (especially among those who are likely to read this answer) may find it easier to empathize and associate with Salman since, in the US v/s THEM dichotomy of lawful citizens and criminals, they would find it more natural to place Salman in the US group.In other words, while they will never imagine themselves in a situation where they would be in a place or time like a lower income group laborer who molests a girl, it is not difficult for them to imagine themselves in a situation like Salman\'s. People drink, and they often do utterly foolish and irresponsible things such as driving while drunk. After that, it\'s only a matter of a loose hand on the steering and a lot of bad luck, and you cause someone\'s death.Bollywood: The sympathy from Bollywood is largely expected. Some extremely tone-deaf and immature remarks from some Bollywood folks were indeed unexpected (you know which ones I am talking about), but barring those, the general sentiment is hardly surprising. He also appears to be generally large-hearted: tonnes of people have tweeted how he helped them out in times of need. You expect family members to support each other, so this reaction from Bollywood, which typically always sticks together as a fraternity, was not unexpected, especially in light of the other points which further help people rationalize the crime.Celebrityhood: Being a celebrity is a double-edged sword. At one end, the police officers and other people involved in this case have been living in hell because of pressure from all quarters. The story of the prime witness (who is now no more) is heart-rending to the say the least. On the other hand, a lot of people know, deep down, that if this were not a high profile case, it would probably never have gone even this far, was very likely to have been settled out of court, with the settled out of court part most likely being a euphemism.Like I mentioned above, sympathy is only loosely connected to lawfulness. A person who uses a legal loophole to rob an old widow of all her money and belongings and bring her to the streets may have \'technically\' done nothing wrong, but is likely to get a lot of public hate. Likewise, being wrong does not preclude someone from getting sympathy.Prison sentences have to end up serving the dual role of keeping dangerous elements away from the society, and providing a disincentive for people by punishing them for breaking the law. Typically, these two often get treated differently by people. For instance, everyone seemed to sympathize with Ravindra Patil (the prime witness) when he said that he was put in prison with hard-core criminals for repeatedly failing to appear in court. All in all, the outpouring of support for Salman is not entirely unexpected. Whether it is unreasonable or not is a call I would leave for the reader to make. This answer is likely to be misconstrued and misinterpreted, so it bears repeating: it is intended not as a defense, but rather as an attempt at analyzing why people (have) behave(d) the way they do (did).(Thanks to Alankar for help with parts of the answer)'

S' As a student, you would probably want to intern with multiple companies to get a wider range of experience and exposure. This might be helpful in making career choices later on, and at the very least would also broaden your network.Of course, this might change a bit based on other variables. At big companies like Google, one internship might be very different from another based on what teams you are on. Another potential scenario I can think of is if you are in a research internship and have developed a good relationship with your adviser. In this case, if returning helps you go deeper into the field and get good quality publications etc., you might want to return there especially if you are planning to apply to grad school.'

S" As others have written, while the term cottage cheese is commonly used to denote Paneer, there are slight differences in the way the two are made, and the ultimate difference from an end-product point of view is that paneer is pressed and comes out as a solid that can then be cut, while cottage cheese is wet and has loose curds which cannot be used the way paneer is used in Indian dishes. I've tried making palak paneer (paneer in a spinach gravy) using cottage cheese, and though I tried to strain the cheese, I still ended up with the cheese splitting and breaking down into tiny chunks and spreading all over the gravy.So what is the solution? Simple. Use the term Paneer and give people one of the following options: Tell them to buy paneer from an Indian storeIf an Indian store is not accessible, tell them how they can make a close approximation of paneer from cottage cheese, because if they use cottage cheese off the shelf in Indian paneer recipes, they will not get what they are aiming for.If they are particularly enthusiastic about it, tell them how to make paneer from scratch. It's not very tough, actually, and Youtube has tonnes of videos. Here's one by my favorite Youtube chef.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...English is a wonderful language that does not shy in absorbing foreign vocabulary. Let's add to the lexicon. :)"

S" The short answer is that they do not. In specific, you should not think of the GRE as the JEE (or GATE) of the United States. Your JEE score is the sole decider of whether or not you get into IIT. On the other hand, the GRE is one of the many variables that are in consideration when deciding the fate of an application. The General GRE is also subject agnostic. It is NOT designed or intended to judge your competence in your major (there are Subject GREs for major-specific testing which are fairly technical and directly relevant). At its more general level, the GRE is for checking your general aptitude for graduate studies.For instance, while many people whine about the Analytical Ability (Verbal) section of the GRE, I think it is actually pretty useful. The expectation is that a person with Graduate level education (no matter what the field) has a fairly high amount of analytical and reasoning skills, along with the ability to correctly analyze texts, draw logical inferences, and express their thoughts in a cogent and cohesive manner. While it is true that this test hinges on one's English vocabulary, the vocabulary level of the GRE is actually pretty reasonable. Likewise, the Quantitative Aptitude section is a general gatekeeper section to ensure that everyone, even those from non-engineering, non-math backgrounds, have a basic level of quantitative ability.We can debate about whether or not the ETS is a giant scam, and whether or not the GRE should be required at all, of course, but don't assume that the GRE is the only thing that decides whether or not you get in."

The question then isn't about whether it is a waste of time, but whether the context needs you to ask that question.It is always about context. If you are in an office in America, and your colleague is German, you don't need to ask them if they know English. If you have been invited for dinner to a German family with whom you have not previously interacted, it might be nice to confirm that they are comfortable talking in English.

S" So far, it looks unlikely that any language will replace English as the lingua franca in the foreseeable future. Imperialism is largely a thing of the past and we don't have large-scale wars anymore, and nothing is actively stemming the growth of English, and, in general, I don't see how any other language will rise to that position given the inertia that English has.English became dominant at a crucial time: the spread of globalism and the rise of digital technology and internet have more or less cemented this dominance. Many languages would have been considered to be so-called world languages at various points of time in history, but the first truly global language was and is English. I mean, no language even comes close. The only potential language that people keep touting is Mandarin, but I don't think it stands a chance either. Even if you were to discount for the extreme tall barrier that their writing system is, the fact is that none of the candidate languages have the kind of global traction that is needed for a language to become the lingua franca."

S" When it comes to learning any language, there is nothing special about English. It needs the same kind of effort as learning other languages. The formula is usually straightforward: immersion and performance.Immersion: This is about how much exposure to that language the learner gets. In case of English, this is delightfully easy. We are surrounded by English content. Movies, radio, TV shows, songs, books, magazines, what not. No matter what your interest, you are sure to find English content in it. Encourage her to listen to and read English even if she doesn't understand all of it.Performance: Stimulus is one thing, but the next important thing is to actually use the language. All the time. Without worrying about being wrong. Encourage her to be adventurous and keep trying out new expressions. This is tougher for English because a lot of people already know it well and so there is this default expectation of competence, so she can begin with speaking English to a close group of people who can be expected to be supportive. One of your biggest enemies, if you are learning a language, is the existence of a viable alternative for communication. Even if you can talk to her in Hindi or Tamil, try to speak to her in English. You can speak a bit slowly if required, or explain stuff using different words. Encourage her, but also correct her as needed. Best of luck!"

S" My experience has largely been with scholarship/fellowship interviews, consulting interviews and CS coding interviews. At least in an interview setting, the tell me about yourself question is a pretty useful conversational starter and is often used by people to break the ice and make the interviewee comfortable. It is important that you dont get tensed up; instead, use this question to ramp up the interview. Jaime has talked about the kind of content you should have in your 'About Me'. A few more pointers:Avoid rambling: Sometimes, when people haven't thought of what they want to say, they end up talking incoherently for a long time. You will bore the interviewer and likely make them disinterested. Do some homework on the kind of values the company has. It might be good to show them in your work to improve your cultural fit within the company. For scholarship interviews, it is useful if you can link stuff in your background with the values of the funding organization.If it is a general scholarship kind of interview where they are judging my overall profile, I like to end with my hobbies / other interests or whatever I like to do for fun. This helps me in two ways: It helps me end my monologue on a confident note, and it gives an easy anchor point that the interviewer can use to steer further discussionI think the ideal sweet spot is when your answer shows preparation (that you have thought about what you want to say), but doesn't look entirely rehearsed. In short, prepare a list of things you want to talk about, but dont memorize the answer word by word. Answers that sound rehearsed are a turn off, especially if you are applying for a job that relies on communication."

S" I understand it would hurt to feel so disconnected with your son. While I cannot fix this directly, I'd try and help you with potential reasons why this might be so, and you could introspect a bit about whether they apply to you. Now, just to clarify, although I'd appear to be blindly favoring your college-going son, I am no apologist for our generation. I don't think we are blessed with exceptional intelligence or insightfar from that, we are winging it, like everyone else.I am going to talk about three things: Conflict, Autonomy and EscalationConflictMost people take the path of least resistance; they will tell you whatever lies you need to hear in order to minimize the conflict in everyone's life. What lies you get depends on what conflicts you mutually create. Sample this:Instance 1: (Son is out having dinner with his friends. His dad calls him)Dad: Kya kar raha hai? (What are you doing?)Son: Dinner karne aaya hoon baahar. (Ive stepped out for dinner)Dad: Jab dekho baahar ghoomta aur khata rahta hai. Mess hai na tere yahaan? (I see you going out all the time. You have messing facilities in the hostel, right?)Instance 2: (Son is out having dinner with his friends. His dad calls him)Parent: Kya kar raha hai? (What are you doing?)Son: Kuchh nahin, mess mein dinner kar raha hoon (Im having dinner in the mess)Parent: Yeh gaane ki aawaaz kahaan se aa rahi hai peechhe se (Why do I hear music in the background?)Son: Wo side mein lounge mein dance practice chal rahi hai... (Erm, they have a dance practice session in the lounge)The truth is that you cannot realistically control every single living moment of your children's lives, especially not when they become adults themselves. So you have to resign yourself to the fact that they are going to do what they want to anyway. If you frequently express disapproval of their activities (in some cases, your disapproval may be justified, but that doesn't matter), they will probably just stop telling you about what they do. If it creates conflict or unnecessary headache or drama, it will be avoided. For instance, if your first reaction on hearing that your son has a girlfriend is one of anger (or worse: OMG! You have a girlfriend? No kissing! Get married soon!), you are pretty much guaranteeing that your son will never talk to you about his love life. Ultimately, unreasonable or excessive expectations are not going to be met with compliance. They are going to be met with defiance and deception. The question is, do you want them to live lives so secret that you don't even know them as persons any more, or do you want to actually be connected with who they really are? If you want to be a part of their lives, you'd have to relax a bit on trying to judge and control them.Note that this does not even need to be directed to your kid. If you make disapproving remarks about your neighbor's son getting a girlfriend, be assured your son is going to hide his from you. If, for instance, you made homophobic remarks while watching a movie or flipping through news channels reporting about 377, you can bask in the assurance that your gay son will never come out to you. Now, this is obviously not easy. After all, your values are not merely a fashion statement. You hold them because you, to a large extent, sincerely believe in them and subscribe to them. But every generation rebels. 30 years ago, people might have prided themselves for having a 'love marriage'. Many youngsters today take that to be the bare minimum.These differing versions of morality across generations aren't new, but it is possible that the chasm has widened due to the much more increased exposure that our generation gets. You will have to resign yourself to the fact that your kid may live a life vastly different from yours.AutonomyIf you made your child grow up with a lot of rules and restrictions, subjecting their lives to unnecessary or excessive scrutiny, there is a good chance that they will want to break free of it all at the first available opportunity. This is also why being overly protective is problematicyou are only creating a recipe for rash and irresponsible decision-making later, making them rush to make use of whatever autonomy they get, because they have been bottling up their frustration for so long. If you try to be too nosy or try to micro-manage their lives, they will initiate micro-rebellions. For instance, although they could tell you that they are going to Marine Drive with their friends, they'd choose NOT to, because that gives them a sense of self-control, of autonomy, and of not being constantly monitored or policed.Ironically, the more you try to be a helicopter parent of someone who is essentially an adult, the more likely you are to become distant from them. Someone I know had such helicopter parents. She worked in a different city, but they'd try to remote control everything she did, everywhere she went, and so on. Did it stop her from doing what she wanted? Obviously not, but it did encourage her to create an elaborate web of lies about her actions and movement. Whose gain was it? EscalationHow do you behave when your son does share something unpleasant with you? Do you go paranoid, or enter panic mode, or go just plain ballistic? If so, you are strongly disincentivizing him from sharing anything with you. There's a reason friends are often perfect for sharing your fears or worries or insecuritiesthey are sufficiently close to you without being so close as to take everything extremely personally. People share stuff for different reasons. Some just want someone to confide in who can process the information relatively calmly, not necessarily a problem solver. If you get emotional or teary eyed or livid at the shortest provocation, your kid will avoid telling you unpleasant stuff, as telling it increases the problems in his life rather than easing them.The 20s are a difficult time for all of this. People have to make the mental transition from needing their parents to potentially being needed by them. While school-going kids are taught to see parents as infallible authority figures, as captors who need to be defied, young adults have to slowly learn to see parents as more human, with their own hopes and aspirations, fears and insecurities. Between these two extremes is the territory most late teens and early 20s find themselves in, wherein they feel the need to assert their independence and gain footing in the world without being tethered to their parents.I don't intend to tell you that your kid is perfectly capable of taking all life decisions wisely. It is likely that he makes several bad decisions. But irrespective of whether he is or not, he is past the age where you can micro-manage his life. Just like the younger generation, you should also try and choose your battles, intervening only for stuff that merits intervention. (Hint: Haircut doesn't qualify)Needless to say, none of this is easy, and I'm obviously no expert, but I hope I did manage to shed some light on what you could potentially do to make it slightly less difficult."

S' I mean, I can understand if we want more people to know about Sanskrit, but I don\'t get the obsession with wanting to revive it, or trying to shove it down people\'s throats. The sad part is that when it comes to nationalistic sentiments, we are faced with a perilous dichotomy:At one end, we have a breed of Indians who feel ashamed of showing any association with their cultural background. These are the kind for whom Yoga was uncool until the west appropriated it and made it fashionable. On the other end, you have those who credit everything from Cold Fusion to In-Vitro Fertilization to ancient Indian culture and spread half-truths and outright lies. And don\'t even get me started on the absolute nonsense that is generally spewed about Sanskrit, a language that deserves so much better.Both these extremes are ridiculous and untenable, and yet, these are the ones we keep encountering most often.Other answers have talked about making people feel proud of the past. Apparently Sanskrit is now charged with the gargantuan task of providing a nation of a motley group of 1 billion people a sense of common identity. Keeping aside the futility of the project, I\'m pretty supportive of showcasing the laurels from our history, but with two giant caveats: correct messaging and intellectual accuracy and honesty.Correct messagingWhat is the undertone of the exposition? Usually I see outright racism or pointless chest-thumping. It is one thing to say, "Hey look at the cool stuff our ancestors did". It is another to say "My Daddy strongest! We were awesome, then foreigners came and now we are useless" or "North Korea, best Korea!"Accuracy and honestyFor every explanation of how the quadratic formula was derived by Indian mathematicians, we get 10 versions of how the Hanuman Chalisa proves that Hanuman jumped to the Sun because somehow distance * time = distance (I won\'t give links. If interested, feel free to Google "Hanuman Chalisa Yojan Proof" and you will get countless websites regurgitating this). For every explanation of how the Astadhyaayi cleverly encodes grammatical rules, we get 10 instances of "Sanskrit is the most beautiful, most unambiguous language in the world, Sanskrit sounds are a linear combination of all the sounds of the world".Until we fix these two, I don\'t want kids to be fed random trivia interspersed with lies and propaganda delivered with inimical messaging. [1] I am not using that term lightly. A lot of what is claimed about Sanskrit is nonsensical and cannot even be assigned a truth value.'

However, you can find beef either at more upscale restaurants in cities like Mumbai or in hole-in-the-wall places in specific areas, such as in localities with a high concentration of Muslims (eg.

S" Many factors make some languages more desirable to be learnt by people. On the global stage, English has emerged as the de-facto language that would make you most likely to be understood around the world. Some of the factors that contribute to this are:English is spoken in several countries around the world, so even passing competence in English is more likely to help you be understood around the world, whereas even expertise in Turkish is largely useless outside of Turkey. For a lot of people, the pragmatics of being able to communicate to a larger group of people far outweigh whatever motivations they may have for learning niche languages.English is massively culturally exported. Hollywood in particular and the American entertainment industry in general have given the world countless movies, TV programming, songs and the like that play over the radio or can be seen on TV no matter what country you are in. On the other hand, while some people might like Turkish music and watch Turkish movies outside of Turkey, Turkish culture has a significantly smaller active impact on the world.Because of the above factors, the knowledge of English often increases people's mobility, employability (and often, provides access to a much greater pool of information, or resources), much more compared to knowledge of relatively niche languages. If you look at the above points, you'd notice that they are largely interconnected. Each strengthens the other and it's the synergy across them all that makes English such a no-brainer of a choice around the world when it comes to choosing a language to learn. The following factors have little to no influence on most people's decision to learn a language: How old / culturally rich the language is: while this is of ample academic interest and would also interest literature / history enthusiasts, the fact that English is at least 600-700 years old has little to do with people learning it.How many people (pure numbers) speak the language: The spread of a language is much more important. A third of the world speaks Mandarin (or a close variant). Who cares? They are all largely concentrated in one part of the world. The Chinese stand to gain much more by learning English than the other way round. Likewise for Bengali. It's spoken by 210 million people. A very impressive figure, until you realize that most of them are in a very small part of the world (West Bengal and Bangladesh).Now let's move to Indian languages. As a language spoken in several Indian states, and understood to some extent by most of North India, Hindi lends itself more naturally as a lingua franca even in places that don't have it as a native language. With larger movement of people across the country, especially to IT hubs such as Bangalore, Hyderabad, and to some extent Chennai, Hindi is now establishing itself as a fairly staple language of these parts too. Note that this does not mean that Hindi is the only language there or that people do not speak local languages or English: there are tonnes of people in South India who do not speak Hindi. But a (only) Hindi speaker will be better off on the streets of Bangalore than a (only) Malayalam speaker on the streets of Chandigarh. So, it's a simple question of pragmatics outweighing everything else. A lot of people are not specifically enthusiastic about going out of their way to learn a new language. I mean, they would probably try to learn basic vocabulary and some abuses (which everyone loves to pick up), but they will do only as much is necessary to get by. If they are naturally immersed in the language, they would largely pick it up organically anyway. So I don't think it's so much about hesitation as about not having to."

S' I think the multilingual dubs of Let it Go are largely an internet phenomenon; and when it comes to the internet, there is very little to gain by creating content in Hindi, since most Indians who consume content on the internet are likely to know English, and many of them might not have Hindi as their first language anyway.Plus, as another person said, it was probably not worth the effort (and investment) for them because India wasn\'t a strong target market for them even for the movie, let alone for internet videos.This kinda feeds into the side-effects of the linguistic plurality of India and the dominance of English among the educated masses. You would see a general lack of quality and quantity when it comes to production and consumption of content in non-English languages by Indians. It is our own doing. How many of us English-knowing Hindi speakers consume (let alone create) Hindi content, in any form? Do we read blogs in Hindi? Do we tweet or put FB statuses in Hindi? When was the last time someone staying in a big city read a Hindi newspaper? We are the hip crowd who, every time the Hindi dub of an English movie is released, can\'t go beyond the "omg what a ridiculous translation of the movie title. wtf is naagshakti why can\'t they just say Slytherin". This is a chicken and egg problem. There aren\'t too many good Hindi fonts, nor is there quality content in Hindi (whether in the terms of blogs or news websites or whatever) proportional to the number of people who speak it.Disney movies and shows usually do get dubbed into Hindi (and even Tamil, Telugu etc.) for Indian Television, so I guess they do bother to put in the effort when they think it\'ll be worth it.'

Nowadays it\'s fairly easy to pick up new talents or skills if you really want to.Maintain good academic standing. A lot of things that I mentioned in the first point would be easier to access if you maintain good academic standing. Especially in the beginning, when you don\'t have specific experience, you might get good opportunities purely based on your grades / CPI. These will then help you gain more experience. One leads on to another. Like it or not, for the most part, CPI is not an unreasonable metric to judge the ability to put in hard work and persevere.Look all around. At IITB, for instance, I\'ve come across people doing all kinds of things, from the run-of-the-mill to the obscure, and often succeeding in it. Watching all these varied people engaged in a motley bunch of things is useful in two ways: It lets you know the kind of options you have, and it also shows you that those options are feasible. Use this to tell yourself that there\'s a lot you can do, but obviously do not limit yourself to what has already been done.The problem with people with stereo-typically \'good\' profiles is that life often does not take their decisions for them through rejection. It\'s easy to decide when you have just 1-2 viable options; it\'s tougher when you have 10 of them. Try not to get overwhelmed by them, and instead try to derive a sense of security or comfort from them. As for absolute clarity about what you want to do, well... that may never come. If it does for you, consider yourself very fortunate.'

S" A resume of some sort is usually always required when applying for any position (even those procured via personal contacts, which involve Dad calling his friend who works at a good company and requesting them to place you).You might not have a lot of stuff to write about in your second year resume, but that applies to most people who have just finished freshmen year. Don't worry about it. I just went through my freshie year resume for reference. Consider including the following stuff:Your rank in standardized exams: JEE, BITSAT etc. Olympiad performance (if applicable)Your Class X and XII Board percentageCourse project you did in first year, if applicableAny extra-curricular activities that you were part of in first yearAny other school level competitive exams that you might have participated in (NSO, NSTSE, NCO etc.)Any major activities or clubs that you were a part of in high school, or competitions you won, or positions you head, such as head boy / girl or House captainAny other awards or honors that you won in high school or first yearBest of luck!"

S' Today is 4th July, the American Independence Day. The American Declaration of Independence contains the lines:"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS."Extremely lofty ideals, undersigned by people who owned multiple slaves on their estates, while asserting and championing the cause of Equality.I imagine this question resonates with a lot of people who are probably reluctant to ask the same thing out aloud for fear of having some unpleasant label (sexist!, misogynist!, entitled male douchebag!, mail chauvinist pig) stuck onto them. The problem with replacing \'feminism\' with \'equal gender rights\' is that it, to a certain extent, trivializes or hides the fact that it is indeed women who\'ve gotten the raw end of the deal across the years, and that actions specific to reversing this need to be taken to undo the mindsets of the people, and the consequence of the current eco-system. It is true that gender normativism, gender stereotypes, patriarchy and related factors hurt everyone. It hurts the woman whose gender becomes an automatic and unfair metric for judging her technical skills.It hurts the man who can\'t pursue fields that interest him and is forced to study \'engineering\' because \'soft fields are for women\' and because \'how will he run a family with his arts degree?\'It hurts the couple who would probably be better off if the wife with better educational qualifications and experience worked and earned for the family and the husband with a knack for parenting stayed home and took care of the kids.It is also true that, as a corollary of the above, both genders also get superficial \'perks\'. Listing just a couple:Women receive perks from the medieval concept of \'chivalry\': there is the expectation that men would pay for them on dates, offer them seats on the bus, brave the cold to keep them warm, get into fights to \'protect their honor\' and what not.Deifying women and putting them on a pedestal: this is common in Indian culture, for example, with women being called \'Devis\' (Goddesses). The flip side of this \'respect\' is even less independence.The stuff written here is particularly dangerous, since it promotes an insidious culture that conveys the impression that there is a perfectly level playing field for men and women. In other words, it results in women winning minor so-called skirmishes (not having to pay for meals) while massively losing the actual battle (not having autonomy in general). It also leads to a certain feeling of entitlement on the part of men, who are raised to believe that they \'deserve\' female companionship (or, sometimes, more bluntly, sex) because they \'did their part\' (paid on dates, bought expensive gifts, went around shopping, and what not). This manifests itself in various forms, from the fashionable concept of the Friendzone, to more drastic consequences such as the Isla Vista killings.Finally, the root cause of injustices against both men and women is the patriarchal framework. For instance, men find it tougher to get custody because of the inherent assumption that women are better care givers, and what not. My problem with \'Equalism\' is that it sets a target that most reasonable people cannot disagree with, without providing clarity about what exactly needs to be done, and masking out the fact that the playing field is tilted in one very-specific direction. As Eivind says in Eivind Kjrstad\'s answer to Is there a gender-neutral term for feminism?, the term would be fine "if the world we live in was roughly balanced between women and men", which it isn\'t.There is a FB group called "IITians against rape". It\'s a bunch of very well-meaning people, but I find the name rather hilarious. Being against rape is like the most trivial lower bound I expect IITians (or any decent human being) to pass; however, as I pointed out in Let\'s get rid of the misogyny, shall we?, well-meaning people who do not rape can still behave irresponsibly in other ways. "Humans for equalism" is then similar to saying "IITians against rape". It is not wrong, but, as long as there remain inequities, whitewashing them with neutral terms or trivial objectives isn\'t going to cut it.[1] I don\'t wish to convey that \'not having to pay for meals\' is a female aspiration; all I am saying that, everything else being equal (which it isn\'t, but that\'s what people think), not having to part with money is better than having to part with money.'

S" The US gets a lot of flak for not using the metric system in everyday life. Why they don't change is easy to understand (it's a huge pain in the ass, with hardly any return). But it's not like the metric system is a perfect, universally applicable system.Powers of 10 are great for scientific calculations, but they are mostly terrible for visualization or approximation in everyday life. A centimeter is often too small and a meter often too big, and no one uses decimeter, so it doesn't matter that it exists. Because of the factor of 10, these units aren't conveniently divisible into thirds or fourths, which is again not conducive to everyday use. Think of recipes, for example. The cup, tea-spoon, table-spoon, fl. oz. system provides an easy, small-whole-number system for converting quantities. It is true that the non-standardization of what a cup or spoon is leads to inexactness, but in most cases, you can still scale recipes by using relative units. You ought to choose units based on what you are measuring. Height, for example is mostly measured in feet and inches even in India, and I find it more convenient than using the meters scale where most people would be between 1.5 and 2. Another example is temperature--the boiling point of water, no matter how important it is to Science, is of little consequence in every day life, especially since even temperatures lower than that are dangerous for humans. The freezing point calibration is more meaningful for people living in cold areas, but like another answer suggested, having a scale which uses the lowest and highest ambient temperatures you will experience as 0 and 100 anchors is pretty meaningful. So, there is nothing inherently 'practical' about the Celsius scale, and it could be argued that the Fahrenheit scale is more 'natural' for daily use.It is easy to visualize a quantity double or triple of a given amount; it's not easy to reliably visualize 10x of a quantity. For instance, you can see how big a centimeter is, but it doesn't instantly give you intuition for how big a meter would be. And visualizing 1000 such meters is again not trivial. So it's not like the 10x multiplier helps a lot in everyday life. If you are measuring driving distance, the fact that a centimeter is one ten-thousandth of a kilometer is largely useless. So a mile is equally well suited for expressing such distances, since both are arbitrary units anyway.The moral of the story is that while the merits of using metric units in scientific computation are plenty, they are not necessarily the most natural units to use for everyday life. Of course, it is possible to use them, like Europe does, but the best strategy of course is to use whatever tool you find convenient for your purpose."

S" I have written about this in the About section of my blog Linguistrix, so will cross-post relevant stuff here. There's also a lot of relevant fodder from my SoPs :)For someone who's deeply into Languages and Linguistics, I started rather late. Although my first experience with Linguistics was in Class VIII, when my English teacher taught me how to write the phonetic transcription for English words.I got to know of phonetics, learnt how sounds are produced, how stresses and intonation work in languages, and how the phonemic inventories of the world's languages were so different yet analyzable using the same tools. But it wasn't until after I had taken JEE that I actually started exploring languages. Although linguistics itself isn't necessarily about learning languages, having some background in linguistics does make it easy to pick up new languages. In the largely creative atmosphere of IIT Bombay, I got the opportunity to pursue academic interests peripheral to my major. I studied French and earned the DELF B1 certification. I used audio courses to study elementary German, Arabic and Spanish. I enrolled in a Japanese course and passed the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) level N4, after which I promptly took up Mandarin, which I studied for a while. I became a regular reader of LanguageLog, the world's best blog on linguistics, and have learnt a lot from the posts there and gotten exposed to a wide range of linguistic issues. I also read books like 'The Language Instinct' and 'The Atoms of Language', which further piqued my curiosity.I also took an undergraduate course in linguistics, where I found myself in my element. Next, I took a course on Paninian Grammar, in which we studied the linguistic basis of ancient Sanskrit grammatical texts.I figured it'd be interesting to do something that combines my various interests, and Computational Linguistics seemed like a good option. So now here I am, finishing a Masters in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington, Seattle, and up for hire in the job market!"

S" I dislike most selfies, but not for deep psychological reasons. My reason is very personal and very, err, selfishMost selfies aren't good. By good, I mean, good-looking photographs that have value for people other than those photographed (or their very close friends). And because of social media, we have to end up seeing them anyway. However, that should of course not stop people from taking them. Which is why I speak just for myself.In the last few years, mobile cameras were getting better, so you came across plenty of decent pictures on your stream. At the same time, more and more people started owning DSLRs, or had friends with DSLRs, so you ended up seeing lots of good quality pictures on your feed. If pictures are aesthetically pleasing, they are fun to look at.Then came selfies, which took us back to the 2009 era in terms of overall photo quality. Portrait shots look best at higher focal lengths, and the effect of low focal lengths on selfie shots can best be seen below. Notice how the leftmost shot of the woman and the rightmost shot of the man are 'selfie-like', while the opposite end is the kind of shot you'd see in a magazine.(Couldn't find the original source for either image. Both have been uploaded several times on various websites).So now people choose to chronicle major events of their life (weddings, graduation etc.) with selfies. These were the kind of events for which I'd earlier see extremely high quality shots taken in good lighting conditions. Photographs that were a pleasure to look at even if you didn't directly care about the event. Now, we get grainy, close-range shots with 5-6 seemingly dismembered and 2-3 partially covered heads with everything looking out of proportion. Definitely not my favorite style for capturing special moments.All that being said, it's their choice to make, not mine to prescribe. Nonetheless, it is an interesting and curious social trend."

S' I think the golden standard for pranks is that, at the end of it, the prankee enjoys it, or at least, can derive fun / humor out of it. This usually rules out most pranks that cause physical harm, or put the person in considerable danger. Dangling someone from their feet over a ledge would mostly count as bullying, not pranking, for example, even if you have no desire to drop them.Also, I hate \'Crying Wolf\' style of pranks, where you give your well-wishers a false alarm for the sake of a prank. The most recent example I found is a commercial launched by Airtel (idea flicked from a similar Carlsberg commercial). The Airtel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...) one looks excessively fake and seems to have been terribly executed, but the idea remains the same"Call your friend late at night and tell them that your life is in danger, and that they need to come and save you." I find these to be in extremely bad taste, and just watching the video was so infuriating, that I am sure if any of my friends pulled such an asshole-y trick on me, it\'d be the last time I ever had anything to do with them.Stuff that causes fairly short-lived confusion / fear but doesn\'t otherwise cause any harm is usually kosher. Switching shaving cream for toothpaste, although very flimsy, is kosher. Switching hot water for cold water, which then proceeds to scald the user, is not.Finally, a much milder variation of the \'crying wolf\' prank, which I\'d illustrate using a personal story.When I was a kid, our school once declared the next day as a holiday for some reason. It wasn\'t a regular scheduled holiday, so my parents were not aware of it. I went back home, secretly happy about getting a day off, and decided to make a prank out of it. I let my dad in on the prank, telling him about the holiday, but asking him not to tell my mom. I\'m a bit hazy on the details but my \'plan\' was that I\'d wake up a bit late the next day, and delay everything so as to get late for the school bus. Then, when the whole household would freak out and my mom\'d probably ask my Dad to drive me to the school, I\'d shout Surprise! and reveal the truth. Everything happened as per the plan, except when I yelled surprise, my mom just said quietly"You could have pranked your Dad instead. He gets up late. At least I won\'t have had to wake up at 4:30 am to prepare your lunch. I could have gotten some extra sleep for a change." I had a chance to choose between a good prank and a bad prank, and I screwed it.'

S" In general, when people talk loudly to foreigners, they also tend to speak slightly slowly or tend to pronounce words more carefully and clearly. These things definitely make it easier to understand a foreign language, especially since a lot of phonetic reductions that are natural for a fluent speaker are very unintuitive to a person who has limited knowledge of the language.Be very careful with this though. Loud, slow, directed speech, especially if combined with gestures, can come off as extremely condescending and rude, and gives the impression that you think the listener is stupid.Since the line between accommodating and condescending is not too difficult to step on, err slightly on the side of caution. If you have more general command of the language (native / fluent speaker), you should ideally try to tune your speech to your listeners's language level. That is, try to speak almost naturally, see if the listener can cope up, and tone it down a bit as needed."

S' I can think of a lot of very useful things, and I won\'t possibly recall them all at the same time, so I will update this list as I do. I would also refrain from using superlatives such "My mom is the best mom in the world!"while they are cute and I can appreciate the sentiment behind them, they do not give a lot of useful information. Personal growthFilled the house with books and cultivated in me a love for reading, which I share with my mother. I was reading books in English, Hindi and Marathi as long as back as I can remember.Tried to give me access to stuff. I grew up very technology literateused computers since I was 7 (this was in the 90s mind you; now kids are anyway born into computers; I am waiting for the first foetal selfie), started learning programming at the age of 9, and in general, spent a lot of time tinkering with stuff.Since both my parents work, I\'ve spent large amounts of time alone at home. To a large extent, they didn\'t police me around excessively and put unnecessary restrictions. To give you a very 90s example, we almost always had Cable TV at home while many other kids had it only during vacations. To my credit, I was never much of a TV-watcher anyway.Financial MattersWe were comfortable but we were not filthy rich, so they shielded me from any day to day financial woes if any, but made sure I still had the \'global picture\'. I think that being subjected on a daily basis to the family\'s financial issues is pointlessly stressful for kids (who can\'t do anything to solve them anyway), while completely shielding them from these matters makes them extremely sheltered and they end up with no perspective of where the family stands.By example more than instruction, taught me responsible financial decision making. Before any big purchase, we always spent time researching our options and trying to ensure we were making a reasonable choice. The result is that I rarely make impulse purchasesthere\'s always a bit of \'due diligence\', so to speak.In the same vein, taught me financial triage by example. They didn\'t mind spending, but they tried to spend it on the right things. They spent on fairly expensive books (which, in today\'s money, might have costed, say, INR 3000-4000), but would have probably cringed at spending the same money on a single night, eating out.MiscellaneousMaintained a largely peaceful environment at home. I didn\'t grow up witnessing constant shouting matches. When I discuss this with people whose experience has been otherwise, they tell me that parental conflict was a big source of stress during their childhood. I particularly remember the most glowing example of this strategy. In the March-April period of my 12th grade, when all kids sit for various crucial and decisive competitive examinations, I remember that my mother had declared the house to be an absolutely zero-conflict zone, meaning that no one shouted, bickered or had unnecessary arguments in the house for those 4-5 weeks. Anticipated my growth needs and didn\'t hesitate in taking decisions towards it. My mom led the initiative to transfer me to a new school (further from home and more expensive) when she realized I wasn\'t getting enough exposure. My parents are very helpful and hospitable; it\'s a bit difficult to put into words but would be amply clear to someone who has been at the receiving end of their hospitality. I like to think that at least some of that has rubbed off into me too; I try my best to help people out.Many of the sentences here sound like lines out of a resume. If only the stuff you did as a parent could be written in resumes...P.S. I guess this is also a great time to wish my mom on Mother\'s Day and thank her for all of the above and for all the rest that I can\'t even begin to put into words.'

S" I hope that, by graduate studies, you mean something akin to an MS and not a PhD. You shouldn't join a PhD program abroad if it is not paying you any salary at all and requires you to take loans.While it's not possible to suggest what you should do without a more detailed understanding of your family's financial situation, as a general rule, I won't particularly recommend selling off family assets if you can avoid it.INR 30 Lakh is not an insanely large loan amount if you are going to enter an industry that is well-paying (which seems to be the case). For instance, if this were a CS degree, and you were going to get into Software Development jobs, you are all but assured an annual income of (at least) around USD 80 K.Job markets can be tough, though, and things can be trickier in Europe, so you should have a realistic assessment of all that. If your undergrad (and now grad) are from prestigious universities, that would certainly make things a bit easier.This also, of course, depends on where the asset is. If it is depreciating rapidly due to any reason, you might consider selling it. But most land assets in developing / upcoming cities in India usually appreciate more than your loan interest rate. Either way, this is something you should discuss with someone who has a better idea of the property market, and that is certainly not me.Finally, you should apply for scholarships in India that provide interest free loans. Some of them are: Narotam Sekhsaria Scholarship, K C Mahindra Fellowship, J N Tata Endowment Scholarship. Note that this year's cycle is largely over, so if you want one of those you might have to apply next year.(A2A)"

S' A lot of people love traveling on freeways since it helps reduce travel time, lets you drive faster than you can in cities, and doesn\'t have a red light every couple of hundred feet. But how many people care about the US freeway system enough to memorize which freeway passes through which city (even in parts of the country they have never visited or care about) or to study the intricacies of freeway intersection design despite no other specific interest in Civil Engineering?(Source: Wikipedia)The first category of people I have described have largely a functional interest in those respective topics, such as liking cars because they help you move. The second category\'s chief motivation for their interest from an inherent enthusiasm or devotion for that subject matter which goes far beyond what the functional requirements it can (or needs to) serve, such as identifying a car from the skid-pattern its tires make, a skill that is of little use outside of forensics. I should point out here that not all such people manage to invest all the time that\'s needed to pursue this interest, but a lot of them do want to.The general term for such people is geeks. Geek is not a universal label. It usually goes with specific subject-matter, such as car-geek, or train-geek, or astronomy-geek (though it is true that without the specific label, a geek is usually assumed to be a tech-geek, but that\'s besides the point).People like to put themselves into such labeled groups because it is a means of self-identification, and also simultaneously a means of signaling to and finding others with similar interests. It can be intensely frustrating to have a hobby that you do not share with anyone around you. Worse, it\'s absolutely soul-crushing to be surrounded by people who not only don\'t share your hobby, but can\'t associate with that sort of crazed up geeky obsession with anything.And so if you are like a friend of mine, you\'d join the Indian Railways Fan Club mailing list and would love to discuss this topic with others who can identify the make of a diesel engine by the sound of its horn.That brings us to food. Many people use the term foodies to refer to food geeks. I personally am not a fan of the word, largely because it sounds kinda childish, and, like most labels, it tends to be applied to anyone and everyone and sort of loses the point. But the ultimate arbiter of language is usage, so I am fine if someone wishes to describe themselves using it. Also, I am very skinny, and the first question people ask is "But if you love food how come you are so thin!?". Another is "But IITians to kuchh bhi khaa lete hain naa" [But IITians can anyway eat anything right]. That gets tiring fast.You might be a food geek, if, as some others have suggested, you care about more than just the functional use of food. You care about knowing more about how it\'s made, possibly making it yourselves, about what goes into it and how the various ingredients contribute to the final taste, about possessing interesting tools, devices, utensils etc to help you in your cooking, and about the kinds of skills people who cook food professionally exhibit (I have spent way too much time staring at cooks deftly throwing dough into the air to roll it for Pizza bases or Rumali Roti, and at people chopping onions at blazing speed):https://youtu.be/0tpvNUH3KDI?t=5sSo, yes, there is more to being a food-geek than just wanting to eat food. And people who share that extra enthusiasm for food like to identify themselves and possibly others.'

S" Consultancy firms usually like to see excellence in whatever you want to do (usually called spikes in the resume, and I will use that term here without loss of generality) and in my experience with the IIT process, usually aren't too picky about any one kind of excellence. The ideal profile of course has more than one spike, but I have seen loads of people getting shortlisted for interviews with excellence in just 1 domain (or a bunch of very closely related domains). Some of the 'standard' examples (but by no means exhaustive) of strong profiles in particular domains are:AcademicTop of the class with a very good CPI (say DR 5 or better, and 9+). Research experience, especially at reputed institutions. If papers / patents, then even better. Other awards or achievements surrounding academics.Cultural / SportsDomination or significantly wide-spread participation, victory and involvement in a culture genre / sport, including wins at various level such as intra- and inter-college levels. Any other formal acknowledgment if possible.OrganizationalStrong leadership roles at hostel or institute level or those involving large projects or dealing with a lot of people. and so on... In each of these, you'd notice that the usual expectation is that you do whatever you are doing really well. There do exist small differences in the preferences of the top 4-5 consulting firms. I have noticed, for example, that one of them has been focusing on very stereotypically academic profiles in the last 2-3 years, while another focuses rather strongly on people with organizational experience. A CPI of 8, however, while being good, probably isn't amazing enough to be a spike, but you should hope that your other academic achievements make up for it.From what you describe, I imagine that at least some consulting firms would find your profile interesting, though they might be a bit skeptical of whether you really want to be in consulting, given that your profile is particularly well suited for academia and research. This is something you have to first convince yourself of, and then the firms you apply to. Best of luck!"

S' One of the top answers on this page (by Robert Frost) suggests that "Be a man" means to evidence the aspirational characteristics of a grown man, such as strength, bravery and control.If words could mean whatever the heck we wanted them to while ignoring the ground reality of how they are used by society, then I could posit that calling a woman a \'bitch\' actually compliments her reproductive ability by assigning her the characteristics of a female dog in heat. After all, that is what the literal meaning seems to be, and there is nothing wrong in being called a female dog anyway, right?Unfortunately, the meanings and implications of words, which they absorb based on the way they are used, cannot just be wished away, and even if the speaker who uses them is clean of intent, they can still have ill-effects."Be a Man" is the kind of exhortation that is almost exclusively directed at boys and men, and is usually in response to displays of emotion or sentiment or \'weaknesses\' which are considered fine when done by women. Note that this is unfair to both men and women. I am sure corollaries of the same can be found in cultures around the world. Hindi popular culture has a line Mard ko dard nahin hotaa (A real man doesn\'t feel pain). This kind of messaging is fairly pervasive in society. For instance, guys who cry are usually asked not to cry like (little) girls. As a side note, I find the societal prejudice against crying rather laughable, since I find it to be of immense therapeutic value.Of course it is true that most people who ask others to \'man up\' or to \'be a man\' aren\'t necessarily misogynists themselves. But this name-calling achieves absolutely nothing anyway. You could pluck petals and count \'Misogynist! Not a misogynist!\', if you want, and we would get no further as a society unless we figure out exactly why such statements are problematic and correct the problem.As Gayle has suggested in her answer, whether we like it or not, misogynist or not, well-intentioned or not, this phrase (and specifically, its common usage):perpetuates a lot of (hetero-normative) gender stereotypestakes some supposed ideals (such as excessive stoicism) and sets them up as specifically associated with menassociates the negative quality of the lack of said dubious ideals with the female genderA certain amount of stoicism in the face of adverse circumstances is a positive quality, but encouraging (or rather peer-pressuring / bullying) people to bottle their emotions up forever because displaying them is unmanly is hardly the ideal we want to set up as a society anyway, as Eivind has pointed out in a long comment debate below one of the answers.Moreover, I find this phrase pretty indefensible even if we were to ignore the \'display of emotion\' aspect and focused entirely on stuff like bravery or altruism. As cliche as it sounds, kids should rather be getting the message that they ought to be brave because they are good human beings, and not just because they are boys / men who have to act as knights in shining armor for their fragile princesses.Back when I was in primary school, if any of the boys had very long hair, the biggest threat the teacher used to offer was that if the kid didn\'t get a haircut soon, they\'d put a clip / band on his head. These are kids in single-digit ages, and they are already learning that society considers it embarrassing for guys to be like girls.I could go on and on and cite examples, but I hope I have made my point. This kind of harmful messaging is all-pervasive, and phrases like "Be a man" are instances of the same, no matter what their original, optimistic intention be. I should point out here that "Be a lady" is almost equally regressive. A phrase sometimes found in Hindi stories is   (literally: diffidence / shyness fit for a lady). We no more want to teach girls they should always be diffident and shy than we want to teach boys that they should suck it up and not cry.When people talk about empowering women and removing gender divides, they focus largely on reducing rape and increasing employment for women. Most of us never realize the inimical effect of all these tiny but constant and ubiquitous signals that we as a society send to ourselves.I know all this seems like petty nitpicking, but I hope that we all agree that, as a society, we should be moving away from such normativity and especially from deriving modern-day ideals from the middle-ages.We cannot stem all of it, but the least we can do is to not actively condone it.'

S' Here are some things that usually never get told, and I figure they are worth giving a thought to. I\'ll talk about three things:Eschew Department StereotypesLook for full disclosureHave Fun with AcadsEschew Department StereotypesEver since the day you came to know about your branch allocation, you must have been inundated by pointless, irrelevant and often wrong feedback about your department. It will worsen now that you are in IIT, with every other person commenting on your branch selection and passing along traditional wisdom. If youve taken a low-ranking branch despite getting a high rank, youd be called stupid. If youve opted for Dual Degree when your rank allowed you to choose BTech, youd be called stupid. If you let it be known that you intend to do research in Meta, youd be called stupid. You will soon realize that, as a freshie, its very easy to be called stupid..Its also equally devoid of content. By giving in to department stereotypes, you not only straitjacket yourself, you fall prey to years of prejudice. Choosing Meta is not stupidbut whiling the first two semesters away because you were told Meta is a lukkha branch is. Obviously, branch does matter. All men may be created equal, but all branches certainly are not, which makes it all the more important that you have a realistic idea about your branch, instead of swallowing recycled stereotypical trash hook, line, and sinker.Department stereotypes are self-fulfilling propheciespeople tell you there are no future prospects in X branch, and you spend your IIT life resigned to this fatality, while wiser people go ahead, pursue those prospects, and get them.Eschew Department Stereotypes.Look for full disclosureAs freshies, you would find yourself at the receiving end of advice, suggestions, opinions, recommendations and what not from a wide variety of people (including, rather ironically, from me, through this post). Develop the judgment to figure out whose opinion to take on a particular matter. It is very rare that youd encounter a person who could give you valuable advice across a large and diverse array of fields. The guy who gives you excellent dating advice wont necessarily give you great foreign-internship fundae. And the friend who you trust your deepest secrets with might give you lousy advice about which elective to take.Also, look for full disclosure. Often, a lot of what people would tell you would be tainted with whats good for them instead of whats good for you. Did the hostel sports secy just tell you its not necessary to study for next days Maths Quiz because he wanted you to go cheer for the Hostel Water Polo team? Did a CG/Manager just tell you CPI doesn\'t matter? Did your neighborhood 10 pointer just tell you extra-currics are useless? No one really wishes you bad, but that doesn\'t mean you take in everything they say without scrutinizing it and looking for full disclosure.I find it funny when the only credential juniors offer about a piece of info/opinion is "Kisi senior ne bola hai" [Some senior told this to me]. Avoid having "One Stop Seniors". At IIT, you find yourself part of a diverse group of brilliant people. Everyones different, and unique. Theres a huge wealth of experience to tap into. Talk to everyone, but take a smart call about who you would trust best for what.Look for full disclosure.Have Fun with AcadsIIT(B) is not Three Idiots; it is not Rang De Basanti; it is not Main Hoon Na. In fact, it isn\'t anything like the stereotyped mush that Bollywood (and other mainstream media) feeds you under the all-inclusive heading college life.A common motif in most colleges, and IITB is no different, is a fashionably cavalier attitude towards academics. Its a screwed up system where not only is it OK to not study, its actually socially desirable. Instead of going into a hatred spiral where you teach yourself to not give a fuck about academics, try to look at courses and subjects as something potentially interesting. Obviously, neither all courses nor all professors will be fun, but youll be surprised at how much the quality of your experience would improve if you treat academics with slightly more openness.Ask questions. Interact. Maybe read up a bit. It wont need a change in your schedule. Just your attitude.Dont suck up to profs. But carry an ounce of empathy.Have Fun with Acads.This was originally written for my blog (To Freshies - Antariksh\'s Blog). Originally, this post was supposed to be a retrospective post about college. I took those elements and condensed them into a few things that Id want to say to the new batch at IIT. Theres nothing batch-specific about the post, though.'

S' I think it\'s great.And frankly, I don\'t quite get the negative hullabaloo around this at all. Most of the internet seems to have well-deserved appreciation for this move, but I\'ve also read some nasty comments too, which I hope are not representative of the majority.Since the benefits of such a move by FB are self-evident to quite a few people, I\'ll rather answer key points of criticism that I found on the internet."This is the height of political correctness!"This has really nothing to do with political correctness. The fact is that not all people comfortably identify with the binary buckets that we like to put ourselves in for ease of classification. And I imagine it would be greatly relieving for such people if they are given greater freedom to choose.Plus, it causes no difference whatsoever to the lives of most of us who are lucky enough to have identities that more or less align with social norms. And it makes a positive difference to the lives of the relatively few who to whom it does matter. A friend of mine, for instance, changed their pronoun setting on FB to they from the original he. Did it make any difference to my life? No. Did it make some positive difference to my friend\'s life? Apparently it did.What exactly are we afraid of? That kids would now be exposed to these fancy-schmancy terms that \'weird people\' use to describe each other? Well, perhaps this is an excellent time to have a discussion with kids about the fluidity of sex, sexuality, orientation, identity and about the difficulties involved in navigating a world that finds it too difficult to see any shades other than white and black. If it leads kids to have better understanding and sensitivity about any of these things, and it makes at least a few of them stop bullying that \'girly, sissy kid\' in school, we would all be better as a society."We should strive to discourage gender stereotyping completely instead of giving people 50 buckets to stereotype others into"But this isn\'t about stereotyping either. It is true that there is diversity of form and expression in this domain. It is also true that this should not be grounds for discrimination. The two are rather independent. The solution to the problem of stereotyping isn\'t to declare that we stop acknowledging variation or diversity. The path to greater acceptance does not include brushing stuff under the carpet."This is just a move by FB to make more targeted advertising possible!"Well, that\'s certainly plausible. Or even highly probable. But let\'s look at the horrifying implications of that claima company that makes a very large percentage of its 7 billion dollar revenue out of advertising added a feature that helped increase its advertising revenue.So, yes, even if FB did it primarily to increase their ad-revenues, it still remains a fact that it lets people express themselves more freely.

S' My roommates and I were discussing (in jest, in case that isn\'t clear) yesterday night that we should all root for Sundar Pichai for the MS CEO role, just so that we can maintain the IIT hegemony in the tech industry. Jokes apart, though, I think most people realize and acknowledge that hard work and stellar performance almost always trump academic pedigree. This is likely to be overwhelmingly true for the choice of a CEO, where you\'d rather judge a person on the acumen they have shown and the results they have delivered for their company across the years, rather that what school they graduated from 25 years ago. If it is true that Sundar Pichai was a strong contender for the post, I am rather confident that at no point of the selection process did anyone say "But this one is from IIT and that one is not!", except perhaps as a joke.Academic pedigree does often help you (or make it easier to) get into desirable jobs in the beginning of your professional career. It also usually increases your chance of being at the right place at the right time, and of grabbing a good opportunity. It also makes it more likely to be part of a great peer group, and these things come with other synergistic effects. It is also likely to lead to a more enriching undergraduate / graduate experience. But it is neither necessary nor sufficient for being \'successful\' in life, and this probably stands true for a widely diverse range of metrics of success.IITians would do well to realize (if there are those that already don\'t do so) that the IIT on their resume doesn\'t give them a trump card or an all-access pass, and those who could not get into IIT despite wanting to would be well-advised to not consider their academic background a major impediment.This is true for the IITs, just as it is true for top US schools, and I don\'t think Satya Nadella\'s appointment has changed that.[1] I am assuming here that many people consider an IIT degree to be academic pedigree.'

S" There are many ways in which running marathons seems to be well-placed as a fund-raising activity, and appeals to us more than many other fund-raising mechanisms.From the POV of the fund-raiserRunning is an activity that is accessible to almost all of us. Barring specific cases of handicap, everyone can run, no matter how old, young, thin, fat, tall, short, and no matter what their general athletic condition is. Everyone and their grandmother, almost quite literally, can run. There has also been research demonstrating that the human body is particularly well-suited for long distance running.In continuation of the above, running is largely money-agnostic. Casual runners do not need very specialized gear, and you don't need access to fancy courts or other infrastructure. Feel like running? You can start today. You are rich? Doesn't matter. You are still gonna have to run yourself. Can't delegate it. This is also a kind of fund-raising activity that is not dependent on entry into elite social circles. Unlike, say, high-profile charity events. [Edit: it is true, though, that some marathon events tend to be very elitist and expensive for runners]Running, and the lead up to it when people train for it, promotes a culture of physical fitness. It creates positive idols, so to speak, and is therefore well suited with the whole charity image. Unlike, say, just starvation.A marathon is short enough an event to impact public memory and to attract media attention. If you want to do a 10-day long drawn out thing for charity, people are likely to get bored.From the POV of the donorIt doesn't ask money for a product / service that can otherwise be obtained at a potentially lower price / better quality elsewhere, and thus doesn't give you the feeling of being forced to spend money on something you probably don't need or appreciate. Unlike, say, scout-cookies.Deep down, I imagine that most of us have (not sure whether innate or conditioned) appreciation for raw hard work. Often, hard work and perseverance are considered as the ultimate arbiters, and running is the kind of activity that demonstrates pure, raw, determination and hard-work, untampered by anything else that'd tilt the playing ground. Rather, in continuation of the previous point, it abstracts out any product / service and replaces it with just hard work and perseverance. I will end with a small quote from Three Men on a Bummel by Jerome K Jerome Folks with nothing else to do, nursemaids chiefly and errand boys,with now and then a perambulating costermonger added, would gatheron the common of a fine morning to watch them pass, and cheer themost deserving. It was not a showy spectacle. They did not runwell, they did not even run fast; but they were earnest, and theydid their best. The exhibition appealed less to one's sense of artthan to one's natural admiration for conscientious effort.I think it's this natural admiration for conscientious effort, unfettered by anything else, that appeals to us all the most about marathon events."

S' As a general rule, if you are in a foreign country, it is usually never a problem if you try to speak the local language [and appear to be making a genuine attempt rather than trying to mock them]. The response you get may vary slightly with where you try this, but it is in general positive. In countries where English is taught but not really spoken all that much, the service staff would mostly be more than glad to talk to you in t the local language, and even humor your potentially wrong attempts at it. Even in places like India, where most people in the service industry (such as in fast-food places and so on) speak in English, and where English is relatively more common in every day life, we love listening to foreigners speak Hindi (or whatever the relevant local language is), even if it is just a terribly mispronounced "NuhMUHsTay". In some cases, though, especially in countries whose local language is spoken no where else, and where English literacy levels are very high, people are sometimes reluctant to talk to outsiders in the local language. Whether this is out of courtesy for the listener or out of the annoyance of having to listen to your language being butchered by a non-native speaker, or a mix of both, I don\'t know. Personally, as a language learning enthusiast, I find it very very annoying if I make an attempt to speak in the local language and I get replied to in English, but I usually give people the benefit of doubt and assume that they either did it out of courtesy or just wanted to practise English.Finally, when you are in the queue at a fast-food place or even in a busy supermarket, people might just not have the time or patience to entertain your attempts at trying to communicate in the local language if you are not making a lot of sense. So it might be better, in such circumstances, to communicate efficiently in English, and delay language practice to a more suitable time.Most people appreciate it when someone tries to learn / speak their language, and tend to warm up considerably to foreigners who do so. Don\'t miss the chance!'

S" I dont think Mood Indigo or IIT Bombay are at fault just because Palash Sen said something during Mood Indigo. As a matter of fact, if anything should tarnish IIT Bombays reputation, it should be the fact that Palash Sen said nothing that is not already expressed overtly or covertly in the male-dominated culture of the institute [1]. The fact that most of the crowd cheered him instead of booing him is more telling. However, these are useful lessons for the future for everyone involved.Is Palash Sen sexist at heart? Does he lack respect for women? I don't know nor do I care. So, articles trying to prove that he is not sexist because he treats his coworkers well or because he wrote a song about mothers are not really relevant to the issue. The world probably won't become a better place even if we somehow proved so, because the issue isnt about who he is, but what he did.Specifically over-targeting Palash Sen, baying for his blood, calling for blanket bans on Euphoria, trying to somehow establish that he is sexist and an evil man, and other hyperbolic actions like these serve only to derail the actual issue that the Mood Indigo debacle has highlighted. And it's not often that such issues come into limelight. So lets use this opportunity to step back a bit and take stock of the situation instead of fulminating all over the internet.(In this answer, I will not use words that tend to bucket individual into 'opinion / action groups', such as feminists, misogynists, and the like. Let's attempt to see the whole issue without labels.)The first step is to understand why a certain faction of the society is displeased with what took place at the Euphoria concert at Mood Indigo. Mind you, what Palash Sen said is neither new in content nor category. As far as content goes, I am sure you've all heard stuff like this countless times. As for category, it was very representative of the kind of speech that peddles reductionary class-based stereotypes. There are reasons why such comments are frowned upon, and they have nothing to do with Palash Sen, Mood Indigo, or Euphoria. First, lets talk about stereotypes:Stereotyping by itself isn't always necessarily harmful. The key here is to understand what kind of environment a particular stereotype creates or perpetuates [2]. For instance, in India, you may stereotype Bengalis as fond of sweets, or Tamilians as fond of curd rice. In absence of any other relevant evidence, this is a fairly harmless stereotype. However, if Bengalis are being systematically and unfairly persecuted by other communities because of their fondness for sweets, or if someone who doesnt like curd rice is systematically denying Tamilians equal opportunities just because they are from the South, it is easy to see how invoking such stereotypes would be below the belt.The second thing of note is that merely the fact that a stereotype is statistically correct doesn't make it okay to peddle it. It doesn't take a genius to observe that there are fewer women than men in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, while the reverse may hold for, say, the liberal arts. However, using this as proof that 'men are for brains' while women are for beauty is not correct. Additionally, it is important to realize that a possible reason for not too many women being in STEM fields is the fact that their participation receives significantly more social resistance than that received by men (if any). They also receive a continuous stream of both subliminal and overt messaging that discourages them from pursuing these fields. And when some of them do get into institutes like the IITs, they enter a male dominated world where guys are taught that IITian girls are ugly and non-male and what not. As if that were not enough, entertainers come to their cultural festivals and peddle this very stereotype again. And again. And again. Do you see why this is a problem?Two negatives stereotypes don't cancel each other. Saying 'girls are for beauty' doesn't become alright just because you also say 'boys are for intelligence'. A couple of answers here seem to suggest that it's okay for someone to peddle patriarchal stereotypes if everyone is equally insulted. Sorry, but it doesn't work that way. Saying that boys shouldn't / can't cook is as bad as saying that girls shouldn't / can't, say, drive. Both perpetuate hetero-normative gender stereotypes. Palash Sen's comments feed into the very same patriarchal stereotypes, and are hence being considered to be in bad taste. Not only is mindless stereotyping therefore problematic in itself, but in a lot of cases, this affront comes from a privileged group that was often primarily responsible for causing the marginalization of the group that they are now mocking. Imagine being excessively bullied in school, being made to resent your existence, and then being laughed at by those very bullies for being in the wretched state you are in. Now imagine this happening day in and day out. Whether it be men mocking women, or whites mocking blacks, or the straight community mocking the LGBTQ community, such behavior is not too different from bullying.Whatever be the issue, such cavalier commentary is often so commonplace that most dont even realize that it is potentially harmful, and most dont realize that those who raise voices against it arent necessarily doing it for publicity.The second step is to realize that, as members of a class that has historically been privileged, it is not always easy for people to see or notice this disparity or discrimination. How many of you who are right-handed have noticed that the desks in many classrooms are much more difficult to use if you are left-handed? If you hadnt noticed this so far, that does NOT mean that you hate left-handed people. It doesnt mean that you dont want to help them. It just means that you have hitherto been completely unexposed to the problems of being left-handed because you have been lucky enough to have the world designed for the default setting that you belonged to. And that is perfectly fine. But when someone does point out why this is problematic, I think they deserve to be heard instead of being typecast as pseudo-whatever. IIT Bombay has now officially banned Euphoria. This is a bit like suspending a police officer for taking a 200-rupee bribe, or failing a student for cheating when everyone knows that most others cheated too. Its technically correct, but it doesnt necessarily improve anything in itself unless the system is cleansed too, because the police officer is mostly just a symptom of the bigger problem. [Later edit: I completely agree that celebrities (or anyone with a larger reach) should hold themselves to higher standards than others. But, these standards will come into place only when people realize and accept that there IS indeed a problem if you say in front of 10000 people that women are for beauty and men for intelligence. What annoys me isn't that Palash Sen said those things, but the fact that he so steadfastly refuses to acknowledge that they could indeed be problematic. It is clear that it's not a 'communication gap', since his clarifications are as incriminating as the initial claims. We all do slip up at times, but given time to look back at our actions, we should realize and own up if they were problematic. Palash Sen has refused to do that, and instead chose to bully those who raised their voice.So, not only did Palash Sen not show basic empathy, he: A) Trivialized the protest and mocked the protesters by making the facetious remark that they perhaps wanted to call him sexy/sexiest and not sexist. B) Refused to accept that what he said was problematic in any way. C) Tried to absolve himself of basic responsible behavior by implying that he didn't need to be mindful of what he said because he isn't a social activist.These are not signs of a man who hates women. But these certainly are signs of a man who, though he might respect women, is simply oblivious to the kinds of issues that plague our society. I expect better from our celebrities and role models.]And so, if our educational institutes really care, there is significantly more to be done by way of educating the thousands that pass through them, so that the next time someone says something like this at MI, we dont see statuses on FB suggesting that girls just cant take a joke.P.S. There are some additional issues here, which deserve some discussion, but this answer has already gotten too long, so I will probably write about them on my blog instead.[1] Let's get rid of the misogyny, shall we? - Antariksh's Blog [2] Gender Identity: What is wrong with sex-typing?"

S" Kinda sorta maybe yes, but like with everything, it's more complicated than that. Of course, it'd be nice if the English spelling system weren't so opaque. It would certainly help if more people could spell English words correctly more easily and learners (both native and non-native speakers) didn't have to waste a lot of time wrapping their head around the idiosyncracies of the English spelling system. After all, most other languages that use the Roman alphabet have a spelling system that's significantly more systematic than that followed by English. However, if your ideal is 'pure phonetic orthography', by which I take to mean that you're referring to a system that accurately and predictably represents in their spelling the exact pronunciation of English words, then you are in for a lot of trouble. First, which pronunciation? Even for languages that are spoken in a small area, you tend to get pronunciation variations across dialects, and across speakers. And that's for languages with a few hundred thousand speakers. Think about English, spoken by hundreds of millions all over the world. First language for some, second language for some others, and a third (or nth) language for the rest. Even within what you consider native speakers, you can expect to get a tremendous amount of variation, and it is tough to identify one canonical form.So, whose English would you spell phonetically? Would you spell pin and pen identically in Southern United States since the two words are homophones in their dialect? Or would caught and cot be spelled differently in Britain but identically in, say, Western United States? If everyone's gonna spell English their way (and they should be allowed to, if the whole point was to spell it purely phonetically), is this less chaotic, or more chaotic, than the status quo?Check out the variation in the caught-cot merger in North America (Source: Wikipedia). Mind you, this is just one particular variation. Furthermore, even if you did choose a dialect, what kind of speech should you accurately represent? A word spoken carefully as an individual utterance can sound very different from the same word spoken in a sentence, and even that can change based on stress and other factors. And finally, as a few others pointed out, it's sometimes worthwhile to maintain 'deep orthography'. Since the words writer and rider are homophones in many US dialects, would you necessarily gain more by expressing the action of writing as write but the person who performs the action as raiduhr (or whatever system is chosen)?These are only some of the issues. Like it or not, at some level, spelling representations serve as abstractions of the underlying phonetic forms. Moreover, they are usually not expected to convey information to a person not familiar with the language. Even in languages with fairly unambiguous spelling systems (Indian languages, I am looking at you), the written form is almost never 'purely phonetic'. The English spelling system should have been more regular. But purely phonetic? Not really."

S" One of the first things taught in an introductory linguistics course is that our knowledge of our native language is tacit knowledge. It is notoriously difficult to actually write down the patterns that you observe in a language. But ask any native speaker if a sentence is grammatical, and they would tell you their judgment instantly.When people formally study their native language, or see others studying it, they are often introduced to the correctness conditions [1] of their language, or to interesting phono-morpho-syntactic tid-bits. This can be very fascinating, and very revealing, since they had probably never looked at their native language in that light. For instance, Hindi speakers might tell you that the Hindi spelling system is very phonetic and exactly represents words as they are spoken, but probably never realized that they pronounce a word like  in     differently from that in     (the nasalization in the terminal vowel of the second word is irrelevant to the example).There's also another factor in play here. Some people might still associate 'complexity' with language superiority or with a language being more developed / advanced / evolved (or similar pseudo-scientific terminology) based on how complex it is. And so there is some pressure towards maintaining the status of your language by asserting that it's fairly complex. Note that this doesn't mean that languages absolutely don't differ in their degrees of learning difficulty. Different aspects of a language may be of varying levels of difficulty for a learner based on the languages they already speak. And it is possible that aspects of a language may take a child slightly longer to pick up. But, in general, it's not a good idea to trust uninformed native intuition about the difficult level of their language.[1] I deliberately refrain from calling them 'rules' since most people interpret that as a normative statement about language, which it isn't. The term correctness conditions has been taken from Ideology, Power, and Linguistic Theory by Prof G. K. Pullum."

S" This is not really a dilemma if you handle it well. You can definitely teach your kid English without having to choose between making her 'lose her roots' or 'grow up to ridicule'.For the first 7-8 years of my life, I was raised by my mother's parents. My grandfather knew English but no one else in the house did. Moreover, I grew up in Madhya Pradesh (a core Hindi state) in a Marathi household. My grandfather is a thoroughly self-made man, and can be counted on to understand the impact of tiny (dis)advantages early in life. Just like you, he recognized the importance of me learning English. Being the only English speaker in the house, he'd often talk to me in English, and encourage me to reply in English, helping me figure out the best way to frame reply. He was my go-to English resource. I also went to a school where the medium of instruction was English. However, that doesn't ensure anything in itself.Kids don't usually like to learn if they know they are being 'made' to learn stuff. He'd employ interesting techniques to ensure that I absorbed things without being consciously aware of them. When I was learning to walk, he'd make me count my footsteps in English as I climbed up the stairs. Mind you, all this happened when I was less than 6 years old, a period particularly facile for language acquisition. By the time I was 7, I could talk fairly comfortably in English for a non-native speaker, and since I grew up in a Hindi / Marathi household, I had native competence in the two languages.During all this, however, I was also reading Hindi (and occasionally Marathi) newspapers and books and comics and what not. When I grew slightly older and started staying with my parents, they subscribed to kid magazines (in India, they'd be stuff like Champak or Balhans) in both Hindi and English. By the time I was 8, I was reading Hindi translations of Mir publication books such as Fun with Maths and Physics. I grew up fluent in all three languages, and due to my exposure to books such as the one I just mentioned, I am luckily comfortable even with technical vocabulary in Hindi. So yes, it is completely possible to raise your kid in a way that she picks up English, but please don't let her grow up in a monolingual environment, thereby wasting the natural advantage that most people growing up in India get. Immerse her in English, Hindi, and other languages too if possible. She gets to learn them 'for free' and she will thank you later! :)My own personal plan is to have my kid grow up exposed to at least 4 languages."

As far as possible, we should try not to police people's liking / preferences.But when individual desires get fossilized and institutionalized, an innocuous preference turns into a much more malevolent societal prejudice.Take, for instance, the issue of sex selection in India. At an individual level, it's perfectly fine to want to have a boy and not a girl. A lot of countries allow couples to 'choose' the sex of their child and the sex ratio of these countries has remained healthy despite this freedom. One hopes that in a large sample of parents, there will be many who'd want to have a girl, and many who'd want to have a boy, and the numbers would even out. But in a country like India, the desire to have a male child has institutionalized itself to the extent that it is no longer possible to expect things to remain in a natural equilibrium. In a similar fashion, virginity has historically and traditionally been associated with arbitrary notions of purity. We know that women have been at the receiving end of long-term institutionalized prejudice, and glorification of virginity is just one face of this many-headed monster. Your ideal of pre-marital celibacy is likely a channelization of the same mindset.And so, coming back to your question. No, it's not really objectionable for you as an individual to want a virgin wife, but you should understand how your innocuous choice isn't necessarily innocuous in the larger scheme of things. And you should understand why most women would take offence at this 'requirement' of yours.[PS: Some commenters are accusing me of 'bashing' OP. I am struggling to find parts of the answer which do this. I think I tried to explain the reason OP's 'choice' may be considered objectionable by people. This is what OP asked in the first place. If he wanted people to agree with him no matter what, he should not have posted the question on a public forum.Furthermore, some commenters have accused me of giving a 'societal' perspective to an 'individual' question. Well, I wrote at the outset that, as an individual, OP has the right to choose what he wants, but that it is important for him to distinguish his choice from his entitlements and to also understand why others find his choice problematic.]"

He then said that he had told only a couple of friends so far and that I was probably the 4th or 5th person to know. Now, a bunch of people have come out to me prior to this, and it's not a big deal. But in this case, I was a bit surprised because I didn't know him. He is a junior from my university, but we have probably just met on a couple of occasions.I told him I was totally fine with it, and that he could trust me, but that I was curious why he had chosen to tell me despite not knowing me well. He replied that he had read my answers on Quora and the stuff that I write on my blogs and that I came off as a tolerant and rational person, and so he felt safe telling me what was probably the biggest secret of his life.Frankly speaking, this is one of the warmest compliments anyone can get.I wrote this in my answer to Interpersonal Interaction: How can I make myself more broad-minded?, and I'd reiterate it hereWe don't exist in a vacuum. We are a part of a complex society and our actions contribute to the overall health of the society. Everything we say and do, especially in public places and public forums, can have invisible but strong influences.If you are the sort of guy who makes homophobic remarks just to look cool, you are helping create an environment where gay folks feel scared and insecure. If you are someone who makes boorish remarks about women, it doesn't matter then that you think 'rapists should be hanged' or that you participated in candle-lights vigils after the Delhi gang rape. The truth is that you also ended up contributing to creating a negative environment for women. So don't be such a person. We don't need to put on a cape to help people. There are easier, more effective ways.[Thanks to Anasuya for 'editorial work']"

S' The idea of a new Star Trek television series excites me. Star Trek belongs on television not in the cinema.BUT... I am concerned that the series will be produced by Alex Kurtzman, one of the producers and writers of the Abrams Star Trek films. I did enjoy the first of those films, but the second one is beyond embarrassing. Star Trek Into Darkness is not the product of people that understand Star Trek. It is not the product of people that understand story-telling.Kurtzman\'s television productions are a mixed bag. On the bright side, he is one of the people that gave us Fringe. But, on the other side, he is one of the people that brought us Scorpion.As a writer, he has written terrible scripts for Transformers and Amazing Spider-Man 2. Hopefully he will stay out of the writer\'s room.This new Star Trek television series will be the flagship of CBS All Access, the digital streaming service of CBS. To watch the series, people will have to subscribe to that service for around $6 a month. That means it won\'t merely be a product that CBS hopes will bring them profits, it will be something that can greatly affect their larger corporate plans. That means they will probably feel compelled to be involved in the show in an editorial way. That didn\'t work out to well last time. I would much rather a company like Netflix was producing the series. Netflix appears to be much more comfortable allowing creative people to tell their stories the way they want to tell them.I\'m very curious to know what the concept will be. It won\'t be Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock. Will it be the Enterprise? Will it be a starship on a five year mission? Will it be set in interstellar space or will it be set on a planet or starbase?The series I would like to see would go back to Gene Roddenberry\'s initial inspiration. Gene Roddenberry saw Captain Kirk as a futuristic Horatio Hornblower. The Hornblower novels, by C.S. Forester, follow Horatio throughout his career - from midshipman to Admiral of the Fleet. I would like to see a series that followed a character throughout their Starfleet career, starting with their first assignment and leading to their first command. The perspective of the audience would change as that character climbed the ladder. We\'d see adventures from below decks during the first season, rarely seeing the bridge or the captain, similar to the excellent Star Next: The Next Generation season 7 episode "Lower Decks".What I most don\'t want to see is dark rooms. If you have the energy to power a warp drive and a transporter, you have energy to turn the damn lights on. I want a show that is bright figuratively and literally.Star Trek is incredibly important to me. It is a fictional world that I crave to visit. It has influenced every facet of my life. I so much want more of it, but I don\'t want it to be soiled.'

Voyager's mission was to visit each of those planets. In order to do so, it had to be be at the same location as each planet as Voyager moved outwards.

S' The story doesn\'t explicitly say. Dickens wrote the story in 1842-1843 and it was published for the 1843 Christmas season. The only mention of time in the story is when Scrooge asks the Ghost of Christmas Present "Have you had many brothers, Spirit? and the Ghost responds More than eighteen hundred." Since we know there is a new Ghost of Christmas Present each year, we know the story takes place more than 1800 years after the birth of Christ.The easiest assumption is to assume the story takes place on Christmas Eve 1843. But, the epilogue narration tells us:"Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world."That leaves us to either assume the omniscient narrator is referring to the future or the story takes place far enough in the past that Ebenezer could become a better man before the story was told.'

He has repeatedly said how grateful he is for the quality of the script in Casino Royale that allowed him to be Bond, rather than just impersonate past Bonds.Any negative remarks he has made have been about the exhausting process of making the films. They are massive films that put a lot of pressure on the star. They are physically demanding films that strain the body - work on Spectre had to cease for a few weeks while he had knee surgery after an on-set injury. They are films that require a lot of travel, keeping him away from his family. He\'s just exhausted and wants a break.There are two things that have to be understood to understand the context of his remarks:1) Craig is English. Sarcasm is as essential as breathing, for him. One has to understand sarcasm to understand his remarks.2) He doesn\'t enjoy spending hour after hour with stupid journalist after stupid journalist. These big movies require press events where the actors sit in a hotel suite while journalist after journalist is put in front of them and given a few minutes to ask the same idiotic questions the last forty stupid journalists asked. Going through an experience like that makes one lose track of how many different people are asking the questions. It starts to feel like the same person is asking the same question. Imagine that instead of talking about the current film, you were getting asked over and over if you want to make another one. Wouldn\'t you eventually try to make it stop by using hyperbole and saying something like "I\'d rather cut my wrists with this bottle!" I sure as hell would. Look at this clip. Wouldn\'t you want to throw this journalist through a window?https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sj...The same thing happens here on Quora - on a much smaller scale - We get asked the same questions over and over and over.

The problem during the last twenty minutes of the film is that the trajectory that returned the Hermes to Mars was not low or slow enough for the MAV to reach. The Hermes was not entering a parking orbit, it was doing a high speed loop around Mars and then back to Earth.Therefore, the objective on the ground was for Watney to reduce the mass of the MAV so that it could reach a greater altitude and higher speed.'

I assure you, it's kind of funny.Yesterday (yes, this happened yesterday) a couple of friends and I were invited to my other friend's house for a house party. We were there from eleven at night until seven in the morning. It was pretty fun, to be honest. We were all joking around and pulling each other's legs. We were smoking some hookahs and snacking on banana chips. Suddenly someone has the brilliant idea of getting some alcohol  which I was dreading. I've stopped drinking since August of this year and I knew I'd end up taking care of anyone that got too tipsy.Now, this party wasn't an ordinary party; most of the people there were on wheelchairs. There were only a couple of people there who could walk, (this bit of information is really important). It was about three in the morning and two of our friends went to get some alcohol. All the girls that were there are light weights  they almost never drink more than two glasses of red wine. Well, the boys came back with the alcohol. They bought two bottles of red wine and two large bottles of beer.Suddenly, one of my friends (Amy) launches herself at the wine and demands everyone to pour her some. My friend (Dex), who is a self-proclaimed bartender (even though he sucks) poured all the girls (except me and one other friend (Erica) ) somewhat equal amounts of wine. The boys divided the beers into glasses and everyone started drinking. Suddenly, Amy finishes her glass and asks for more; since she's a light weight, I told her to enjoy the wine with sips, and not to down it immediately, otherwise she'll definitely get drunk. Of course, she doesn't listen to me.Amy finishes her second glass and starts complaining that she isn't even feeling a bit warm or high. She starts blaming the guys that they got her grape juice instead of wine, which in retrospect, I wish it was true. Quite quickly, she finishes one whole bottle of red wine. Then, she starts hitting people, laughing, shouting, screaming, and then crying. It was quite heartbreaking to see her release all of her suppressed emotions and anger.After seeing this, we cleaned up the hookahs and put it away, we started sitting around her, trying to calm her down, trying to make her laugh. She was a wreck of emotions. Amy was sitting against the headboard of the bed, with her legs facing the door. I was sitting on the edge of the bed, with my legs hanging towards the floor. Suddenly, Amy tells me to come closer, because she wants a hug (she was too drunk to move). I shifted closer to her and gave her a hug, I told her everything would be alright.Amy pushed me and screams for a bucket because she was going to vomit. Well, me being the dumbass that I am, I didn't move becaus everyone was running around to get a bucket. As soon as one of her cousins brings a bucket in, she projectile vomited on me, luckily I turned my face away and leaned my body back, so she vomited on my stomach and legs  a little bit got on the side of my neck too. He finally gave her the bucket and she puked her insides out.If I had to insert a rubber duck at any moment, it would have to be this one. I'd insert a huge jumbo sized rubber duck, that was big enough to shield me from her projectile vomiting. I mean, it would look funny but it would also stop me from smelling like vomit."

If you don't know what happened to me, I suggest you read: Virali Modi's answer to What does it feel like to survive death?.In 2008, I weighed 75kgs, I was paralyzed from my chest down. I had some movement in my arms, but they weren't strong enough for me to be completely independent. My mom and I moved to India, leaving my father behind in America (so he could provide financial stability). It was incredibly difficult leaving behind the United States and of course my father. What made it even more difficult is the fact that I didn't know Hindi (a widely spoken language), I could only understand it. The only languages I knew were English and Gujarati (my mother tongue).On top of that, when we landed in Mumbai, the next day, we took a train to Delhi for an ayurvedic treatment. This treatment required my mom and I to stay there for a month (coincidentally, my birthday month). I was given digusting medicines to drink and pills to swallow, oil massages in which I couldn't shower for a couple of days, and head massages which left my hair oily and gross looking. I was also put on a strict diet which, in retrospect, wasn't really healthy. The people there knew no English, which made it hard for me to communicate with them, because I couldn't speak Hindi. The treatment didn't help me at all. It was a failure, I saw no improvements, even when I continued the medicines at home for over a year.During that year, I also underwent another treatment which was kind of the same, but the men that would massage my legs, would come home. The oil was a mixture of herbs, oils, and seeds  which smelt horrible. I was sexually assaulted by one of the men there, so we stopped the treatment, after doing it for over five months. This treatment didn't yeild any positive effects, either.For the next two years, I underwent so many different treatments; you name it, I've done it. I also went to several astrologers/fortune tellers, because back then everyone kept saying that someone's done black magic on me, which I never believed. We spent so much money behind these treatments, astrologers, and fortune tellers. As you can imagine, there were no improvements. I was the same as I was in 2008.In 2010, I came across a treatment known as Stem Cell Therapy in Mumbai. I went there, I met the doctor and the therapists, and got an evaluation done. They explained the treatment in such detail and showed me their results and research (I also did my own research), that I was content and ecstatic with it. I went ahead and booked my stay there for the stem cells. I've been going to Neurogen for approximately five years now, and I haven't looked back. I was 75kgs, short, stumpy, and paralyzed; Now I'm 52kgs, average height, healthy, and I'm able to feel contractions of my legs muscles. I'm getting better, and I haven't believed in any other treatment, more than I believe in this.I can definitely say that my treatments, the experiences I've had with other people, and the unfortunate events that I've been through has made my risk (moving to India) worthwhile. My health has greatly approved, I have over 43k followers on Quora, I'm gradually gaining fame, and one of my favorite directors (of Bollywood), Mr. Nagesh Kukunoor tweeted about one of my newest written article, which has made me ecstatic!"

S" Just this year when I went to Zimbabwe for my boyfriend's sister's wedding, I was shunned by all of the kids my age. Apparently some of the elders were talking trash about me to his parents. They were saying stuff about me being on a wheelchair, about me influencing Dhyaan (my boyfriend) to leave his parents, and other bad stuff which I don't want to share. Dhyaan's cousins started creating drama too. They'd leave me alone and go out for lunch, they'd play games and wouldn't include me  just really childish things. Dhyaan wouldn't be home most of the day because he was still working during the three weeks when I was there (they distanced the music night/engagement, mehendi night, wedding, and reception into three weeks, so the guests coming from out of the country could stay around and go sightseeing).When Dhyaan would come home, he'd see me sitting all alone on the sofa, playing with my phone. His parents were also influenced, unfortunately, and were acting as if they didn't care. Keep in mind, this was my first time meeting them, they shouldn't have secluded me, but I don't blame them (I'll explain more later). Dhyaan also heard about all the shunning and rumors, he took action on it, but silently.He would come sit next to me on the sofa, hold my hand, and he'd kiss my cheek, in front of his whole family. He'd talk to me about his day, and then we'd go outside for a walk, across the street and just sit on the benches and relax in the cold night air. Sometimes we'd go out to his backyard and we'd play with his dog, Milo. He made it known to his family that their words made no difference to him, he was proud to have me (and vice versa), and he loved me.Coming to his parents; the wedding was a very stressful time for them, there was a huge water and electricity problem, on top of that almost everyone got sick with a virus, which turned out to be Typhoid (but thankfully we all had our vaccinations for Typhoid, but still managed to get a cold and fever)  the bride was in bad shape, and as you can imagine, some members of the family were pinpointing his parents about me. His parents reacted like normal people, and I don't blame them. They apologized to me and my mom, and everything's perfect now. Most of you may not know this, but Dhyaan and I met online. Dhyaan's father chose me for him, and that's why Dhyaan and I are together. His parents and I get along well  better than before, and we speak whenever possible. Because of this incident, the relationship between us has become stronger.I was very reluctant to share this story, because it makes Dhyaan's parents look bad, but they really aren't. Anyone can become confused and can get quickly influenced when they're under stress. I request you to not say anything mean about his parents, because I care for them and they care for me. They aren't in the wrong."

S" Do you know what you should've done when she was giving you hints? I think you should've asked her if she liked you and was indicating a relationship, if she would've said yes, you could have told her exactly what you told us (that you had prior commitments). You could've asked her to wait, and none of this would've happened. Usually, the biggest mistakes we make are all communication related. I'm not trying to discourage you by saying this, but I want you to understand this for your future.Look, she's happy with her boyfriend and you're happy for her, even though you're miserable. If you keep letting her control your life, you will never move on. If she keeps staying in your heart, you won't have room for another person (that might be your true love). Three years is a long time, you need to move on. You need to go out there, live your life, hang out with your friends, and you need to be productive. She deserves to be happy, but so do you!Try meeting new people, try engaging in thought provoking conversations, try different cuisines, go traveling, basically just do something different and adventurous. Think of it this way; after getting in another relationship, you might not have the time or the resources to participate in different things because of a relationship. You have that time now! Go out there and do something different. These different experiences will help you grow and mature as a person.Look, if you don't want to do all that, then join a gym. Working out can do wonders for your emotional and pyshical health. A good physique can give you major confidence, and lifting heavy weights can be a good stress buster. An added bonus: A good physique will definitely help you in the ladies department. Joining the gym and working out may just help you make friends, and possibly help you find a companion.All of these things are destractions to help you forget about that girl. If you really want to forget her, implement some of the things I've said (and other people will say). Other than that, it's really upto you. If you really want to forget her, you need to work on it. Time will help heal wounds, but those urges to talk and wish for more, need to stop.Hopefully this helps. Good luck, OP."

S' A couple of weeks ago I had gone out partying for my birthday (it was an early celebration). Well, my friends and one of my cool uncles had come along (my mom didn\'t come). We went out to a lounge and he was forcing me to drink (because it was my birthday and according to him, I should be sloshed). I told him to call my mom to tell her that I\'ll be drinking (the place was loud and wasn\'t extremely accessible for me to leave to make the call). He told me not to worry because he\'d handle it. Guess what immature, stupid Virali did? I trusted him and I drank, a lot. I usually don\'t drink more than I can handle, but my uncle kept insisting, so I did.Well, I blacked out, the last thing I remember is that we were dancing, and then nothing. The next morning, I wake up and see my mom staring at me. She started yelling, saying how I was immature and irresponsible (which I agreed to). I told her the story and she called my uncle  he lied. He said that I was already drunk before I met him, which wasn\'t the case. As you can imagine, things got pretty heated at home. That\'s when my dad called.Dad - "Beta, what happened last night? How much did you drink?"Me - (I told him the whole story) "Dad, I\'m so sorry, I promise it won\'t happen again. Whatever he was saying was lies." (I kept going on and on)Dad - "It\'s okay, I believe you. Relax, it happens sometimes. You don\'t have to apologize as long as you\'ve realized your mistake. A word of advice, dear: Don\'t trust anyone, especially if you\'re drinking. People will take advantage of the situation and they will manipulate words in order to make you look bad. Just understand that."Me - "Okay dad, I\'ll make sure of that. Thanks, pops. I love you."Dad - "I love you too sweets. Here, let me talk to your mom, she must be fuming."I gave my mom the phone and he calmed her down and spoke to her. She suddenly relaxed and gave me the same advice my dad did. I don\'t blame my mom for her reaction, someone could\'ve taken a physical advantage of me in my passed out state. I realized where I was wrong and promised her and my father that I\'d never do it again.Since I was born, my father has always been a workaholic, I wasn\'t ever technically raised by him. Yes, he\'d always give me words of wisdom and would help me through issues, but my mom mostly raised me. My dad would always be the saviour whenever I was wrong. My mom has a bad temper, while my dad is really relaxed and cool headed.

It's the best way to reenergize yourself.Another thing that helps is to spend time with family. After getting home, I spend time with my parents and talk to my boyfriend; we're people who like to share  maybe even overshare parts of our day, and usually it turns into a laughing contest. Even if there isn't much to talk about, it's nice to have a cup of coffee/tea with each other.The best thing, in my opinion, is to have a home cooked meal.

S' Yesterday I was at the mall when I saw a Tarot Card booth that was owned by two ladies. Well, I sat down and she told me to pick five cards and to ask a question. I asked, "When will I start walking?" She told me that she won\'t be able to give me the exact time but she\'ll give me whatever message the cards show her. I picked out five cards and almost immediately she said, "You worry too much. You need to stop thinking and worrying about your future. Sometimes things are meant to happen more quickly, but by doubting yourself and thinking too many negative things  like asking yourself \'what if\' questions, you\'re promoting negative energy to enter your heart and mind, which causes the positivity to lessen and eventually, it disappears." Look, I don\'t believe in fortune telling, palmistry, astrology, and other forms of fortune reading. I believe in hard work that comes from deep within the heart. I\'ll tell you something though, her words hit me like stone. I felt that she was extremely right. I do think too much about my future, especially about my legs. You won\'t believe this, but I do ask myself, "What if I don\'t walk? What will I do? How will I survive?" Shocking, right?Guess what I did today? I went to therapy, and from this morning, I stopped thinking about my future and my legs. After therapy, I realized what kind of positive effect it had on me. I had improvements. My muscles and genuine movements had improved. I don\'t know if this is coincidence or if it\'s actually because I stopped thinking about myself and my legs.Why am I telling you this? Well, I think you should stop thinking about the future. Everyone has some mishaps in their life, whether it be because of education or because of money. You cannot keep thinking about that specific mishap and how it might affect your future; because it will affect your future, but for the better. Start thinking of other options for your career, you might not be destined to do what you initially planned on. You should always have a backup plan, even for your backup plan. I think that\'s incredibly important. You think you\'re not fit? Why don\'t you start going to the gym? The gym will help you vent your frustration and it\'ll help you get fit and you\'ll lose some weight. Along with that, start devoting your time to things that are important to you, hang out with your friends, and try looking at different options to help you with your future.In short: Stop worrying so much and try living your life without thinking too much about your future.'

They\'d help me through anything if I told them the whole truth.At a young age I did hide things from my parents, and I paid a price. People were spreading rumors about me that weren\'t true and I didn\'t know what to do. It was mainly because I went to a party and had a little too much to drink. I was only fourteen years old and I was rebellious. My mom constantly saw my long face everyday and would ask me why I was upset, but I couldn\'t tell her.When I finally did, she was upset with me. She shouted, because drinking at such a young age was really unheard of in my family. To be honest, it was stupid of me to do that. After all the waterworks were done, she gave me some advice and I implemented it. Guess what? The rumors died off.That\'s when she told me, "People in this world are just waiting for a reason to talk about you, put you down, and to hurt you. Not everyone is a well-wisher. You shouldn\'t trust people so easily. Be yourself and be wise. The only people that\'ll be there for you are your parents. Dad and I will always be there for you, no matter what. We\'ll help you through anything, as long as you tell us the truth."From that day on, I\'ve respected her wishes and quickly realized that she was extremely right. They\'ve helped me through so much and are so loving and supportive that I have no reason to hide anything from them.

Smiling is a small gesture that doesn\'t cost anything, is effortless, and is actually really good for you.Personally, when I have a bad day and I don\'t feel happy or good about myself, a smile from a stranger really helps me. It\'s like an indirect messaging saying, "Keep holding on and being strong, you\'re doing just fine. We all go through it, but keep being you and keep thinking positive thoughts." At least that\'s what a smile means to me.Another thing that I try to do everyday is to compliment at least one person. Look, people have bad days and they fight battles that are unknown to us. Sometimes a simple compliment can make someone feel that they\'re appreciated. It can make them feel good about themselves. Yes, it\'s happened to me. Often, I get complimented about my smile or my weight and it makes me feel so good about myself that I stop worrying. It brightens up my day.

S' Here\'s the thing: Indians have populated the majority of Quora, that\'s a known fact. There are a couple of things that irk me, which I\'d like to mention. There are users on here (not particularly Indian) that ask troll questions, simple questions that can be Googled, questions that are demaning and sexist (which are very, very hurtful and controversial), and ask questions before checking for similar questions. There are also those who write troll answers; the reason I say that the majority of such offences are Indians is because if you check the "collapsed answers", it\'s mostly filled with collapsed answers of Indians. This ticks me off. Please, read the rules, look at Deepak Mehta\'s description for an introduction to Quora, it\'ll really help. Their ignorance is making my feed a nightmare to look at. There are also people who are silent readers. They read, upvote, comment, edit answers and questions, and do the needful in terms of merging questions. I really appreciate you. There are also people who provide answers, most of them are helpful and I think more people should provide more inputs if they\'re comfortable.I think Indians on Quora is a great idea, we have a place to express ourselves without being judged (hopefully).

S' 1. When applying mascara to my bottom lashes, I make sure I use the mascara wand to "stamp" my lower lashline so it looks like I used some eyeliner. This trick helps me save time and it gives definition to my lower lashline without using another product.2. If I don\'t have the blush color I want, I use a lipstick of the same color and apply it to my cheeks like a cream blush. This gives me a luminous finish without having to use an illuminator on my cheeks, plus I can use drugstore lipsticks to achieve the perfect cheek color without spending an excessive amount of money.3. For a quick bun, I gather my hair into a ponytail in my hand, then I twist the hair and loop it around itself on my head and use a hair tie to fasten it. It literally takes one minute.4. For extremely soft feet and hands, I apply a heavy duty moisturizer for dry skin and enclose my feet in thick socks over night. The next morning, I\'m left with soft feet and hands. If you don\'t have a heavy duty moisturizer, vaseline works too.5. For an inexpensive makeup remover, I use baby oil to remove my eye makeup. It\'s soft on the skin, it breaks down eyeliner and mascara really easily, and it\'s cheap. You don\'t have to rub and tug your delicate eye area to get your makeup off.6. To make any lipstick matte, I take a two ply tissue paper, separate it and press on sheet onto my lips, taking a translucent powder, I dust it over the sheet and I get instant matte lips.7. If I don\'t have an eyeliner available and I wish to define my eyes, I use an angled eyeliner brush and a mascara to line my eyes. I coat the eyeliner brush with mascara and use it to line and define my top lash line. (Do not use this on your water line, it will burn and make your eyes water).'

I may not be able to give you an actual experience of how the country is and what it's like to live there, but from what I've noticed, during my month-long stay, I hope I'm able to paint a picture that's helpful.My boyfriend lives in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, I've noticed that they have to count each and every penny before spending. Dhyaan is a software engineer but works in a steel company as a seller and the head of IT. There is no scope for engineers in that city and he's getting paid much less than he really should. Their household consists of three earners, his mother, his sister, and him. His father wants to work, but because of his health problems, no one is willing to hire him, due to liability issues.Recently, there has been shortage of water, in the neighborhood he stays in. They barely get water for two to three hours per day, the same case for electricity. They have power only for two hours per day. Living in such a warm country, I experienced how difficult it was to function during that time. For internet, he has to buy minutes for 3G which gets used pretty quickly.I asked him what it felt like to live in Harare versus when he was here in Mumbai for a month. He said that he'd rather live and earn in Mumbai, even if he's earning in rupees, rather than live in Zimbabwe were he's earning in dollars. He said that it's terrible living there; they grow most of their own vegetables in fruits in the backyard, but dairy, meats, and grains are something that they have to buy and it becomes difficult when you have to feed a family of four.I know it's not much help, but I hope I was able to provide something worthwhile in this answer."

A couple of years later, I was approached by a teacher from Barbizon Modeling and Acting school, and they encouraged me to pursue modeling and acting because I had a unique face. I suppose it was just a marketing tactic, but I fell for it. I went ahead and paid the fees for the two month course and received lessons on how to apply makeup, style hair, how to behave, and how to pose in front of a camera.Due to the courses, the participants of the course had an opportunity to meet scouts; I met a scout and I got selected for a soda ad. I was given a date to sign the contract. As you can imagine, I was ecstatic. When the day came to sign the contract, I was in the hospital fighting for my life. I'm sure everyone knows what happened next. I became wheelchair bound and I was paralyzed from the neck down.At that moment, I lost all hope that I'd ever be famous. I didn't think I'd do anything worthwhile in my life. After a couple of years, I started working on my confidence. Gradually, I became so confident that I decided to try my luck in modeling and acting. I was shot down by many, many people, until I came across The Miss Wheelchair India beauty pageant.I participated and I won second place. From that day on, my life changed. People started recognizing me because of the pageant and my writing on Quora. I was interviewed for many newspapers(thanks to the PR department at my hospital), and I was even on the news. I've had so many articles published on various websites, mainly because of all the media coverage and because of my popularity on Quora.The biggest news yet: I was interviewed for a popular Hindi magazine that's widely circulated throughout America and India called Arogya Sanjeevani. I was expecting a column about my life and struggles, rather it turned into a three page spread in the magazine.I never expected to be so popular or 'famous', but it's worked out for me, despite my 'disability'. I now truly believe that there's so much more for me in the future, and nothing is holding me back.(Source: Arogya Sanjeevani)"

S" In my case, I was betrayed by both of my exes. It didn't take me a long time to get back into a relationship; rather it took me about three to four months.My first ex cheated on me, on my birthday with his friend whom he treated like a sister. My second ex betrayed me by using me for a green card (which he wasn't successful). I guess the betrayal from both of them was what made it easier. Yes, I was hurt and in denial, but I made myself strong. I decided that I deserved much, much better and moved on. I started focusing on myself more than anything. I did the things I loved and had a passion for. I also started making friends around my vicinity and ended up having a good time with them.Gradually, I became normal. I was the new and improved me.

S' When you become wheelchair bound, you learn to value each and every aspect of life. Initially, I couldn\'t breathe on my own. I had a tracheostomy done, which, in a nutshell, is when they pass a device through the vocal box to help someone breathe. I couldn\'t speak, they had to put a small "plug" on to the trache to help me talk, even then my voice was barely audible. You learn to appreciate oxygen. We really don\'t think about breathing, but when you have to have a machine to help you breathe, you realize how important it really is.I remember when I was in the ICU that they\'d put me on trials for breathing. I would pass in and out of consciousness because I felt that I couldn\'t get enough oxygen, when that really wasn\'t the case. The doctors and nurses, to whom I\'m really grateful for, would monitor my oxygen levels, to make sure I was getting enough oxygen. At that time, I remember I\'d try to call the doctors and nurses to put me back on the machine because it was incredibly strenuous to breathe. They couldn\'t hear me, because I was paralyzed from the neck down and my lungs were incredibly weak, my voice was not audible. Gradually, I learned how to breathe without a machine and they removed the trache after a month, which is really painful.Also, during the same time period, I realized I couldn\'t move my arms or legs. I was a vegetable. I would try to move my limbs, but I couldn\'t. I would put so much effort into my mobility that it emotionally and mentally drained me. Let me tell you something, we don\'t think about moving our muscles, they just work. When you\'re paralyzed, it\'s incredibly difficult. Try imaging this: You have sleep paralysis, and you\'re having a nightmare, but you can\'t move. The monster is going to eat you, but you\'re stuck, immobile. You do not realize how difficult it is. I don\'t think anyone can understand or realize that.After getting discharged from the hospital, I couldn\'t sit by myself without support. I couldn\'t feed myself, I couldn\'t even use the bathroom because my muscles weren\'t functioning. My mom and dad had to feed me. I didn\'t even have sensation in my stomach. I didn\'t know when I was hungry or when I was full. On several instances, I overate. I ate so much more than I regularly eat. Being a foodie, I can\'t understand how I didn\'t know when to eat and when not to eat. On one instance, I ate over thirteen roits (basically wheat tortillas). My mom kept making them and my dad kept feeding me until he realized that I don\'t normally eat that much. From that point on, my mom made a strict schedule for when I\'d eat and when I wouldn\'t. I was on portion control. I didn\'t know if I was starving or if I was full, like I mentioned before. I don\'t think anyone can realize how it feels to not know when you\'re hungry or when you\'re not. Gradually, I gained that sensation back and I have a normal diet now.Another thing that most people take for granted is the ability to use the restroom. I have a catheter, a tube that\'s inserted into my urethra which connects to my bladder. I have to change that tube every fifteen days because I could get a severe infection that could damage my kidneys. You do not understand how painful it is. Along with that, imagine how embarrassing it is. People, if you have a normal functioning bladder, please don\'t ever take that for granted.In conclusion, please do not take your body parts for granted whatsoever. If you\'re healthy, learn to take care of yourself. Go to the gym, work out, get stronger. Appreciate what you have and stop worrying about minuscule things. Be thankful for what you have and never let a day go without thanking your body for being healthy.'

This guy was from Africa, from somewhere that I knew so less of. On top of that, it was online. Dhyaan could've been anyone he wanted to be and things could've ended badly  very badly.Surprisingly, he and his family are the most supportive, encouraging, caring, passionate, and loving people I have ever known (other than my own). Dhyaan taught me about the African culture, things I never thought I'd get to learn and experience; but because of him, I did. I traveled to Zimbabwe in May (2015) too see him and crossed off another country on the map.Dhyaan especially has always been so supportive and loving. He's supported me in everything and anything that I've ever wanted to do. He's helped me with therapy and exercises, he got me motivated to start going to the gym, and he's actually gotten me to eat healthy food (which I'm not a fan of).All I can say is that, I took a big step especially after knowing how horribly my ex-fianc treated me. I met my ex online too, but our families knew each other, so it wasn't that weird; yet it all turned out so, so bad. Dhyaan and I had no common friends or family at the time, yet things have turned out to be so amazing. His family is my family and vice versa for him."

S' You\'re only twenty-three years old and you\'re ready to quit because you don\'t have friends, a girlfriend, and because you think your life is boring? What will you do when you\'re really faced with a dilemma? Will you think about giving up and quitting, or will you fight?Let me tell you something, you are alone in this world and that\'s extremely frightening, but it\'s the truth. You\'re born alone and you\'ll die alone. It\'s harsh, I know. You know what you should do during this time? You should focus on yourself. Focus on why you feel frustrated and depressed. Is it because you\'re feeling the lack of company or is it something else?There are so many ways to resolve your problems that you probably didn\'t think of. Do you think your life is boring? Well, go out and so something adventurous; go sky-diving, go scuba diving, go to an art museum and learn about famous and not so famous artists, focus on your development, go shopping for whatever it is you like, or find something to do that you\'re passionate about. Your 20\'s are really important, you have the time to learn about yourself, experiences different things, you can take adventures, and guess what  you don\'t need friends to do that.Having a girlfriend is great, but the chances of finding someone that doesn\'t understand you, doesn\'t care for your feelings, and can easily hurt you are high. I don\'t know if you\'ve been in a relationship before or not, but if you don\'t exactly know what you want from a relationship, things can get difficult and messy. You aren\'t mentally prepared to have someone in your life, according to me. Why do I say this? Because you haven\'t embraced yourself, you haven\'t embraced the time alone you have with yourself, and you don\'t seem to love yourself. How can you love someone else if you don\'t love who you are? I\'m sorry that was harsh, but for me, I need someone who is comfortable in their own skin, in any situation. I need someone who loves who they are. That\'s how I know they\'ll be able to love me.My mom always told me one thing, "The wrong friends can ruin you." Guess what? It\'s happened to me. My "friends" spread nonsensical rumors about me, which ultimately ruined my reputation. I don\'t wish to explain what happened, that\'s another answer in its own. What I\'m trying to say is that most people might not understand you. They might take you and your feelings for granted, it might cause you pain. Yes, I have friends. I hang out with people, but I keep to myself a lot. I don\'t share my feelings with other people, because I cannot expect anyone to understand. The only person I can expect something from is myself. If you feel alone and if you want someone to understand you, grab a book. There are so many books out there, you never know what hidden treasure you\'ll find in its pages. This has always helped me.I\'m really sorry if I was harsh, but the lessons I\'ve learned from the people I thought were my own, was a bitter experience. I don\'t think you should have to go through that. I genuinely think it\'s better to be alone than to be around people that don\'t care.Good luck, OP.'

S" I don't think there's an age limit to anything. According to me, you can be sixty years old and party like a college student; at the same time, you can be the same age and study as much as you want to achieve a degree. I think society puts the pressure on us to have our lives figured out by the age of thirty, but that's just not possible. At thirty, that's when our lives are truly starting. We're able to focus on our goals and aspirations, and we can make them reality. Life isn't about going to college, getting a degree, getting a job, and earning money. I think it's much more than that. I think life is about self-realization, understanding who you are and what you truly desire.You often hear about the person who quit their job to travel the world, that's commendable. Having that experience of other cultures can help you understand what you truly want and who you truly are. These experiences help us shape dreams, they help us understand how blessed we are, and help us understand how much we take for granted.Forgiving ourselves for not accomplishing what we dreamt of is a new concept for me. I feel that in life, we go through struggles and hardships to prepare us for what's to come. We always end up doing what we're meant to, and the experiences we've had on the way, shape us for what we're truly meant to be. Usually, it's always better than what we dreamt of.I'm not sure if I really answered the question, I feel I've ventured off topic here, but I hope I made sense."

S' You won\'t believe anything anyone says until you believe in yourself. I follow one rule in my life: If I can fix it, I don\'t have any reason to worry. If I can\'t fix it, why should I worry? Look, I don\'t know what your problems are, but you need to adapt this way of thinking. If you truly know that you can\'t fix whatever it is that you\'re getting paranoid over, then stop thinking about it. Every bad situation will always have a positive ending. Even if you don\'t believe in that, it\'s true. Whatever you\'re going through, will have a good outcome for you. You really should believe that.I\'ll give you my example: When I came out of my coma and I realized I was paralyzed from the neck down, I seriously lost all hope. I didn\'t think life could get worse. I mean, I didn\'t have an education, I was a living corpse, I didn\'t have friends, nor did my immediate family care. I kept worrying about my future too.Then my dad told me something, "If you keep worrying ahout something that hasn\'t happened, how can you focus on what\'s happening right now? Stop being scared and do what you have to do. Don\'t give a fuck about the future." (Those were his exact words).That\'s exactly what I did. Look where I am now, I\'m being featured in newspapers, I was in the news, I did an ad shoot earlier this year, a couple of photo shoots, I perfomed in front of Zayed Khan and Jackky Bhagnani on a wheelchair, I\'m Miss Wheelchair India runner up 2014, and I have almost 43k followers on Quora. I never expected this! I seriously never did! I always thought I\'d do nothing in my life until my dad spoke to me.Life has a way of fucking everything up, teaching you lessons during your struggle, and then making it even better than before. You need to forget about the future and live in the present. Try making your present better, with that, you\'ll get a better future.I truly believe that whatever we put out into the world, it comes back to us. Try thinking and saying good and positive things, see how this changes your life. It\'s helped me drastically, I\'m pretty sure it will help you too.Good luck, OP.'

S' There really isn\'t just one answer. The mixture of products and technique can help to achieve a brighter appearance. Products such as illuminators, highlighters, lighter concealers, and setting sprays can help. Techniques such as the highlight and strobing effect can also help.Combining the right products for your skin type with the right technique can make you look glowy, healthy, and bright. You can also look like a disco ball if you overuse products. In achieveing a brighter face, less is always more.Using an illuminating skin cream, under your foundation can make your skin "glow from within". Combining that with a light shade of concealer, usually two shades lighter than your foundation, and applying it under your eyes, the bridge of your nose, and your forehead can make you look bright. If you really want to enhance that glowy, bright look, you can add a highlighter on top of your cheekbones, your brow bone, your chin, your cupid\'s bow (the arch of your lip), and the bridge of your nose. Like I said earlier, using products in moderation is the key to look "natural". Yes, using that much makeup can make you look natural, if you know how to use the products, how they mix with your skin, the right technique for you, and the right appliances for you. Makeup is something that you have to play around with until you figure out what works for you.'

S' Given that many answers have focused on issues like inappropriate usage of the word "epidemic", effects of media-openness and our perceptions, I will try to answer what remains of the question: if the problem is so obvious, why isn\'t the solution out there? Initially a few socio-economic reasons on how it got there, and continues to stay so. Maslow\'s Hierarchy of Needs/ Priorities: Like it or not, the existing morality of a society depends on the surrounding prosperity and availability of basic needs. This doesn\'t imply societies with lesser would be more immoral, but simply they\'d less inclined to prioritize these issues over ensuring their next meal. Even though India is beginning to bloom, and having a robust economy in the past few years for the majority of post-independence existence, India has been dirt poor. It is still dirt poor in most parts of the country. What this means is successive governments have had a lower priority on providing self-actualization to groups, and more on ensuring better agricultural produce and lesser farmer suicides. At the individual level, society has focused on stable lifestyle choices than focusing on an individual\'s desires which has often (unfortunately) meant the suppression and even oppression of various classes, most notably women. Gender Segregation: People especially from Western societies find it difficult to comprehend how minimal interaction is between boys and girls with an active hormonal system. Schools mostly allocate different seats for boys and girls, parents ensure their best to crack down on children speaking to opposite gender and so on. As a result, the other gender remains kind of a mystery to many grown adults who have been having sexual desires at the same time. This leads to intense desperation among many grown male adults, who now see woman as a medium to fulfill his sexual desires. Meanwhile the woman rather than being allowed to enjoy her own libido cocoons into protectiveness as a result of teachings of evilness of promiscuity, as well as hyper-attention they receive from all the single men (a huge proportion of unmarried population). Religion: India is a deeply religious country, with Hinduism and Islam as the dominant religions. Poverty and religion is a toxic mixture, as now the conservative practices have the assent of God. Lots of these have led to continuing the traditional acts resisting change as immoral. It is almost as difficult to convince a woman her (or other\'s) daughter isn\'t immoral for drinking alcohol, as it is to explain to the chauvinist man who assumes the presence of a girl on the street as a signal of availability.These points cover the variations such as patriarchy, objectification, entitlement and lack of ability to not see women as others. So why don\'t things change? All the above problems are pretty entrenched and worse, correlated. India won\'t become less traditional all of a sudden while firm religious practices exist, and they won\'t cease to exist across generations while poverty remains so widespread.Finally, as we\'re progressing the explosion of social media has brought the ugly issue to the limelight. As a result, it\'s now the top priority for governments to combat, but this is just the beginning and we can\'t just wish such crimes away at our desired pace. India is a democracy. Good intent or even same intentions can lead to paralysis. India has got a majority government last year, but that party is a minority in the upper house till 2017, so pretty helpless in passing ordinances. Traditional roles for women historically means very few women in police force, and this is one of the main things required. Even though women have started to break traditional barriers, and are pursuing this path aggressively now it will take a lot to undo the rigid norms and have a sizeable police force comprised of women. Easily, years.Even though young, educated Indian male becomes conscious of the atrocities faced by women and our contribution to making women\'s lives difficult by acts like staring, whistling etc, a continuation of desperation doesn\'t exactly solve the sexual tension. The increased awareness of rapes and rise of feminist movement has generated a subtle anger among many women, further making life difficult for the young men who seeks intimacy as he often goes through suspicious lens thus reducing his chance. This doesn\'t mean more rapes, but a continuation of the status-quo where males and females are kind of alien species to each other. Population: 1.25 billion people. Let that sink in. More than 3 times the population of the next populous nation- USA. The larger the population the higher the inertia and lesser the effectiveness of rapid change.There is change, the process has begun, people are more aware of the issue, it is now a top government priority but the process will take time.'

S" I visited Stonehenge twice in a very short period of 15 days. The first time it was a touristy endeavor with 2 of my friends. The latter time it was a spontaneous decision to go there, as I found about Stonehenge summer solstice festival just a day before the event. So I will mention in brief on both- a usual visit, as well as the special occasion of Solstice, which is annual celebration in June around 20th-21st. Visiting as a touristAn important thing worth knowing is you can't touch the stones, or get super close. There are ropes put around it, and visitors are not supposed to cross it. Also you can see the Stonehenge from some distance, and entering beyond it you have to pay (I think it was  7). Given these two things, I felt there wasn't an extreme difference in the experience whether one pays to enter or not. The major difference is you can look at from a little closer, they provide an audio device on which you can listen to the history of the stones and of course you can get some pictures from close-up. What I mean is the Stonehenge in itself failed to overpower me and my friends as visitors, with it's sheer awesomeness. It was marvelous that I was seeing something so historic- stones which have been there for ages, whose origins are disputed- but if I hadn't known this- it could just have been some stones put in awesome formations. It looks exactly as it does in the pics, which is obvious but it lacks the grandeur beyond that. Although that might sound true of many other tourist attractions, it is not true for many as well. For me, Stonehenge belonged to the former category. Especially given there was a restriction on entering. The fact that we had come all the way, and it's history as a wallpaper in Windows machines essentially convinced us to pay the extra bucks to see what we could see from a distance. Summer SolsticeIf I hadn't been here, I'd have been most likely very pleased with my experience as a tourist. However going on the summer solstice is altogether a different marvel. On this day they remove all the ropes, so not just you can come close to the stones, but sit on it, dance on it. Drink sitting on it. Everything. What's more? It's literally a humongous hippy party. People from all over the country assemble there, about 30,000- 50,000 in the whole expanse of the grounds of the Stonehenge, and there is dance, music, booze and even pagan worship. This is a picture from an instance when a girl in the crowds started belly-dancing in the middle of the stones.As I said, it has some pagan roots and is essentially a religious cult. Everyone stays awake till the dawn, for the first signs of sun which is considered holy or something. As a result, you have lots of people dressed in crazy costumes attending the fest with lots of amazing practices.I know I make it sound like the hippy celebration aspect of it was the interesting part and I kind of killed the historic site in drunken boorishness, but really what made it special was a mixture of the ability to come close to the stones as well as the festive environment. The only downside was it rained excessively that night, and given that it's a vast open field there was no shelter and only choice was to get wet.How does it feel to touch the stones?Normal. Yeah, they don't feel like holy stones or something while touching it. They aren't of absurd temperatures as well, as I was suspecting. They feel just like other stones, but the fact that I was in the middle of the historic stones and touching them was great, much more than the feeling of seeing it from a bounded distance. I could even climb few of the stones, and it feels great to be on top of them (the shorter ones, the bigger ones are too tall to climb just like that). Access to StonehengeOne of the things worth knowing is public transportation is very poor near the area. It's a site in the middle of nowhere. When I went in the bus, I had to get down 30-40 minutes walking distance away from the site. (at Amesbury- on a X5 from Oxford) While returning, I took a train from Salisbury but it's like 10-20 minutes by taxi to Salisbury. The worse part is we'd to walk like 2-3 miles in excessive rain to find a taxi. So if you don't have a car (and in UK, that's not as big a surprise as not having one in US) it is going to be kind of hassle, especially in rains (which is almost every second day in UK). All in all, Stonehenge has an exciting history and for that the audio device is worth it (although you can most likely read everything online). Seeing the real stones, circling around it while listening to it's history is fantastic. But if you've very high expectations, there's a good chance you'll end up disappointed. Nevertheless the Summer Solstice festival is an experience of a lifetime and added valuable memories to my time in UK."

S' Nothing exists in a vacuum. In the aftermath of Attack on French Magazine Charlie Hebdo, I\'d take an occasion to explain rise and fall of Islam and relevance it holds in contemporary Islamic terrorism.TL; DR Islam is a civilization in decline, albeit a great one in the past, and its adherents have a tough identity crisis to deal with in the face its continuous decline. Not knowing where to look for a sense of identity and hope, they are often susceptible to fundamentalism and the belief that they can regain past glory.This question is asked by many people every day, and the answers on both sides are often either No true Scotsman saying "only some Muslims do it" while others point out "even if not all Muslims are terrorists, all terrorists seem to be Muslim". My aim here is to bridge understanding between the groups, do justice to the topic and analyze future possibilities. Historic ContextAfter its start in 632 AD, within the span of few centuries Islam had grown to engulf vast spans of area not just in the Middle East but even in Spain, Sicily and France. In few later centuries, this influence would extend to Indian subcontinent and even farther east to countries like Indonesia. They would also spread south to African countries like Algeria, Tunisia, Sudan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hor...) etc. In short, Islam at its peak was a huge empire. But contrary to the popular imagery of a sword-wielding religion, it wasn\'t just warfare Islam excelled in. During the Islamic Golden Age Baghdad (and Crdoba, Andalusia) literally became the center of scientific, cultural and economic flourishing. The ideas brought forth were revolutionary for their time. India and China led civilization till about 700 AD, European countries starting with Dutch, Italian from 1500\'s culminating with mighty British Empire in 1800\'s, and currently it\'s USA. But the long period in between 800 AD- 1400 AD Islamic civilization was at the heart of developments in all fields. Its decline began in the early 12th century with the Mongol invasions by Genghis Khan (he was a Tengrist not a Muslim). Christian Crusades "won back" Spain and Sicily causing a blow to the centers of learning. The process intensified with Ottoman Empire\'s invasion of most Arab states, but the Ottoman\'s acceptance of Islam just shifted the center of power to Constantinople. Meanwhile the Mughal Empire was mighty in India during 15th-17th century, thus keeping few powers afloat. All this undoubtedly created a strong sense of Islamic identity for the adherents, based on it\'s glory. But the decline continued with the growth of European powers, proselytizing by Christianity and colonization of vast areas of land erstwhile held under Islamic rule until the 17th century. What this meant was a strong opposition to accepting the ways of the conqueror and thus Islamic identity continued to develop as a negation of Western thoughts and ideas. And so at the beginning of 20th century, there were attempts at Pan-Islamism to unite Islam across the world under the Ottoman Caliphate (or Khalifa). Except that the Ottoman Empire got dragged into World War I allied with Germany and Austria, the Central Powers, and they lost. The saving grace was the formation of Turkey which they thought would be new seat of pan-Islamism (Khilafat Movement). Apart from that were left the less powerful Balkan and Middle Eastern states which were just created. Things took a U-turn when Mustafa Kemal Atatrk banned Islam, focused on secularism (Kemalism). And thus Islamic identity, which had grown as negation of Western powers was under serious threat in the newly disintegrated states with no real political power. The fragile new Islamic identity would trigger several movements such as Pakistan Movement, leading to Islamic states being formed around the world. And just when Islam was trying to reconstruct a new identity Cold War began when horse-trading was high, and both the USA and the USSR would basically align with anyone, depose anyone based on power-politics. The most notable events from this period regarding this were 1953 Iranian coup d\'tat, the subsequent Iranian Revolution (1979), IranIraq War: foreign involvement and incidents like shooting down of civilian airline Iran Air Flight 655 by US Navy missile cruiser and of course the mess that was Soviet invasion of Afghanistan leading to the creation of US-supported Mujahideen. This immediate involvement in wars and coups not only stopped enhancement of fragmented Muslim identity, but further strained it\'s perception of Christian and Western ideologies.Recent history and identity issuesSo why I am telling all this? Because when a high-performing adult plunges into darkness, the only hope it has is to look back at its glory days and try to recreate some of it. More so, they will look at their (perceived) nemesis with grudge and hatred, avoiding their path. This is the identity struggle the current Islamic world faces. A past glorious empire, directly in competition with Christian ages got continuously battered. Meanwhile it also got dragged into wars with lots of supplies of ammunition. What this inevitably meant was the creation of a class of people who would seek this identity through violent means, by vengeful acts against the West. And then September 11 attacks (9/11) happened and subsequently Guantanamo Bay detention camp, American invasion in Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq. This further marginalized the other Muslims, who were now seen with fear and as the other by their Western counterparts. Civilians were being killed by the Western armies thus increasing hatred and a stronger sense of identity as a result of the greater threat it faced. Meanwhile things kept getting muddled in violent cycles such as London bombings, 2004 Madrid train bombings, death threats to Kurt Wustergaard, 2008 Mumbai attacks and now Charlie Hebdo shooting. Given the decline and the constant search for identity, a large section of the Islamic society has found solace in their glorious history. This has led to further radicalization, rigid blasphemy laws and constant attempts to keep the religion afloat. The hatred and Islamophobia justify the necessity for them. The Islamic Revolution created a perfect atmosphere for political opportunism, thus allowing religious tyrants taking charge and creating further mass destruction. To complement this, there are Wahhabist movements under wealthy Saudis who want to promote this rigid version of Islamic identity (Sharia), and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) is basically another attempt, albeit a more violent one at creating the Pan-Islamic world. For the insane actors who have been thoroughly convinced of the "injustice of the West", "revenge" the act to jihad seems like a natural call. The Islamic world attempts to condemn them, but nevertheless are also hurt at the further loss of Muslim identity and marginalization thus cocooning into a protective state unaltered by progressive ideas from the rest and becoming radicalized further. What this means in modern times? Does it mean they\'re justified in killings? Of course not. Does it mean the "average Muslim" is supporting them or identifies with them? No. However what the average Muslim probably shares is disillusionment of the West as well as following rigid religious practices such as believing The Quran to be a holy book from Allah to be followed in word and spirit (pretty similar to Christianity and the Bible, except Christian countries right now dominate the world. Possibly in a few hundred years, Christianity will take Islam\'s violent place after being marginalized by atheism). The average Muslim also probably shares concern regarding the waning sense of Muslim identity. This inevitably leads to the continuation of cycle of terror and ghettoization. Muslims without education will become ever more gullible to the radical agendas. Another worry iseven though it sounds like an exaggeration Islam faces a real threat of a genocide at least in some part of the world (most likely not state-sponsored, but "state-tolerated". The former will create a huge backlash and unification of Muslims)Unfortunately I don\'t see much hope for normalization of relations, as given the vast oil reserves in the Middle East (and thus the out-sized political influence it has) and a great location for trade routes and pipelines, the region will remain a center of attention for all world powers, be it US or China. Also until the sensitive IsraeliPalestinian conflict is resolved, Israel\'s position as US\'s staunchest ally doesn\'t help Islamic cause. And given it\'s violent history with religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, right-wing parties in these countries are on the lookout for opportunities to malign Islam. So negative propaganda against Islam benefits everyone from nations wanting higher stake in oil pricing, energy markets and right-wingers of almost every religion. This is an analysis of the current state of Islamic fundamentalism from a historical context. Of course, this answer also has been trimmed leaving many important events especially in recent history which affected geopolitics of the region a lot. However I\'ve tried to focus on the notion of religion as an identity than just a set of beliefs, and how history plays a role. Anyways if there is a separate question somewhere on how we all commoners should deal with these issues, I will happy to address them within this historical context.'

S' I\'m very fond memories from the first time I met a Nobel Laureate. Not only did I get to see him, I got a long one-on-one conversation with the winner of Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001. It was November 2011. ContextProfessor Stiglitz was giving a talk at Indian Statistical Institute, Delhi on the market imperfections leading to financial crisis in 2008. Even though I didn\'t study there, I was invited because I sat through an entire "Introduction to Game Theory" course. The attendance was only 50-60 and it was a small classroom, so we could all easily see and hear him.The Lecture and ConversationGiven his left-leanings it naturally had elements of it. When he was done, I was lucky enough to be granted one of the three questions. I asked some lame stuff on Occupy Wall Street movement and given his past association with it, he praised it\'s goal. When all was done and room was evacuating, I realized this is my opportunity. I wasn\'t to let go so easily. So I started speaking to him. To sound wise-ass I\'d read on his theories on Information asymmetry, and gobbled everything I could on Keynesian economics from my multiple economics classes. However the questions I asked him were more or less what an annoying 21-year old asks on meeting a celebrity: "how I get there?" using economic and game-theoretic jargon to demonstrate my (genuine) interest in the field. The interesting thing is rather than ignoring my stupid questions, or rushing out he kept on answering my questions, engaging in further conversation on economics as well as path to delve into economic theory for about 30 minutes, till the peon would remind him of snacks and tea outside.Introducing to other economistsIn the lawns, he started conversing with another prominent economist: Jean Drze. What else: he even introduced me to him. And the dumb-head me didn\'t realize he is the collaborator of Amartya Sen (another great Nobel Laureate) on multiple works, as well as member of India\'s National Advisory Council. I was also introduced to Dr. Dreze\'s ex-PhD student and our Professor Reetika Khera, who had recently joined my college (IIT-Delhi). With a cup of tea, one samosa he sat on the stairs at the edge of the lawn (see pic). He said I could email any specific question at his email ID from his homepage. Dr. Dreze even gave me his Gmail ID (which I lost). Finally I realized I should let the stalwarts have their discussion while I should get back to munching free snacks. Pic: ISI Delhi lawns. The arrow is where he sat on the stairsConclusionProfessor Stiglitz flew to India, gave a lecture in a small college, answered questions, engaged in one-on-one conversation with an unknown boy for 30 minutes, introduced him to other leading economists and then sat on the floor. If the man has left-leaning, he is following everything he preaches about curbing inequality to a good extent. I\'m not sure how many other Nobel Laureates have such modesty. PS. I did write him an email to which I didn\'t get a reply. I read the email again today, and I\'d myself never reply to that kiddish (non-specific, generic) email. As I said, I lost Dr. Dreze\'s email ID soon, so rather than emailing him or catching up with Dr. Khera in my own college I updated on Facebook that I met a Nobel Laureate for the first time. Sigh, to be 21!'

S' I backpacked for a week in Thailand 2 months back, and though that hardly qualifies me I would still try. I visited Bangkok, Pattaya and Ko Pha Ngan. I found Thailand to be among the best countries I\'ve visited. Some surprising things from the nation, which I wasn\'t expecting:Good infrastructure: As a developing nation, I was expecting the infrastructure to resemble Indian cities. But Bangkok\'s infrastructure really feels closer to London or NYC\'s than Delhi\'s. Even though that maybe an exaggeration, the infrastructure doesn\'t make it obvious being in a third-world country. Even the under-developed island of Koh Phangan (from an infrastructure perspective) is not that bad. Prostitution is illegal, but...: I\'d read before on the legal status of prostitution in Thailand and it stuck me as odd, given the international reputation it has for this. So the question was- how is the law enforced? To my surprise, there is not the slightest trace of brothels so the law has controlled that part. I\'m comparing it to Amsterdam\'s Red Light Districts which is in the city center, every passerby can see it and access (if they wish). However that doesn\'t mean it\'s not happening big time- it\'s just not obvious. There are too many adult entertainment options in Bangkok, Pattaya at least-- namely Go go bar, Ping pong show, Cabaret in strip clubs and so on. And of course, the Thai massage shops. With girls (?) shouting "massage" to passer-bys. I\'m not sure how many of these operate as backdoor prostitution but the overall gist is- there is excessive adult entertainment without any legal brothels, although there are many girls standing alone by the beach who you can be sure are doing the same illegally. Pic: Clicked on Walking Street, PattayaLadyboys: Of course I knew about lady-boys, but the unbelievable thing was how many they are. I\'m sure they outnumbered the "real girls" in these entertainment districts. Some of them are obviously not female, while for many it\'s difficult to tell. And lots of them are very humorous. For example, when I said no to his/her offers for "massage" they show me directions to nearest gay bar.Poor English: This one really surprised me. Given how much of the economy is based off tourism, it\'s surprising so many of the natives can\'t speak English. What\'s more surprising- too many in the tourism industry can\'t speak English. This was one of the main reasons why I didn\'t interact much with the locals. Excellent public transport: The cities had one of the best public transport options I\'ve seen anywhere in the world. By public, I mean not private. In Bangkok, there is the amazing MRT, BTS and great rail infrastructure. And of course, lots of buses. Apart from that, there are the ubiquitous tuk-tuks (like auto rickshaws just way faster). In Pattaya, I rode shared wagons with fixed rates of 10 baht roaming across the streets day and night. Then there were the ferries for traveling within Bangkok. Inter-city transportation was also amazing. Frequent buses, cheap flights within nation operated by AirAsia, NukAir, Thai Airways. And I also took the over-night train to reach Surat Thani, from where I took a ferry/ship to Koh Phangan. The train was as marvelous as it can get in quality. Excellent partying scene, live music: Although I\'d heard lots about it, I was still surprised by the awesomeness of it. The street off Khaosan Road in Bangkok has amazing live music till 1 am on the streets. Same with Walking Street, Pattaya (although that\'s not it\'s claim to fame) There is lots of partying going on the streets late into the night. Granted most of it is by the Western tourists, but still the energy on the streets is very welcoming and cheers the moods up. These are of course apart from the different moon parties in Koh Phangan, most famously Full Moon Party. Overall for street partying, I can\'t imagine a better place than Thailand. Even NYC doesn\'t match up remotely closely, forget the rest of US (except 6th Street, Austin). Pic: Live music near Khao San Road, BangkokOverall sense of lawlessness: This didn\'t surprise me at all as I expected it but it was mild surprise after realizing the great infrastructure, public facilities. Some examples are vehicle-driving (though nowhere as crazy as India) was way wackier than West. In Koh Phangan, before handing me the motorkbike for rent I wasn\'t asked at all for driving license although the guy kept my passport. Even in Goa, they ask for licenses. Of course, this lawlessness is apart from the street hawkers, hookers and everything related to prostitution which goes on.7-Eleven\'s: There are so many of them in every nook and corner of the country (I went to) that when asked for directions, they serve as landmarks. "Take a left, you\'ll see a 7-Eleven. Keep walking straight, you will see another. Turn right from there". So on. Obsession with white: Before going to Thailand, I didn\'t know their skin-color has a tan. However there are TV\'s with intense melodrama being played a lot, and all the characters are extremely fair. One (Thai) girl I met lamented her darker skin, but was happy she was dating a white guy (British). So I learnt this trend isn\'t exclusive to India.Conservatism vs liberalism: I know this can be different amongst Thais vs what is allowed for foreigners, but the overall idea is Thais show perfect respect for whatever foreigners do amongst themselves even if it may not agree with their traditional values. I know this is how it\'s supposed to be, but even in Goa it\'s not so easy to find peace for traveling as a Western tourist (at the least expect photo-ops).Con artists: Tuk-tuk drivers were expert con-artists, with lots of experience with ripping off tourists. Worse, they seem to have a network with stores, hotels, tourist sites, prostitutes and everything possible so when they\'re giving you very cheap rates someone else in the network is ripping you off big-time. Coming from India, this shouldn\'t shock me except I did get duped by one guy who duped me into paying 1500 baht for some Buddhist temples, which were less than 200 baht. There is expertise in the con-artist market there.Backpacker heaven: I knew I\'d meet lots of backpackers, but the sheer volume of them was unexpected. I met so many from so many different countries, who have stayed there for years and love it so much at least for Western tourists Thailand seems pretty close to the backpacker\'s heaven on this earth. There is just so much to do-- including all kinds of adventure sports, beach activities, snorkelling, scuba-diving.Pic: Jet-ski with a British friend I met in PattayaExpensive: For a Westerner, it\'s definitely very cheap. 1 USD= 30 baht, so basically you get meals for $ 2-3 bahts easily. There are many hotels in Khao San Road around 300-400 baht range. So it adds to my point on backpacking heaven. However if I had to calculate my expenses as someone earning in INR, it could be bewildering for the prices are the same in baht as in rupees in India, except 1 baht = 2 INR.Cuisine: In US, Thai is my favorite cuisine. And yet, it was sort of difficult to find authentic Thai food in the cities except for Pad Thai. After searching hard for local markets, they indeed serve amazing delicacies with spicy sea-food. Amazing Red Curry, Tom Yum Sam, Massaman Curry, pork liver. Street food was amazing. Except...Bubble tea: It\'s my favorite drink, and going to SE Asia I was expecting lots of bubble tea places except I didn\'t find any (cc:Elynn Lee). This was one of the unexpected disappointments.Military intervention: With so many tourists all having a fun-time, one wouldn\'t expect a military role in government. But the military had got entire island of Koh Phangan shut down all it\'s moon parties, including Half Moon Party while I was there following murder of some British tourists. In general I figured military does have a lot of power.Beautiful Buddhist buildings: Ok, there is nothing surprising about it so that\'s why this is at the bottom as a compulsory addition. I expected amazing Buddhist architecture, found it. There are floating markets as well, with lots of temples on the sides. Overall it\'s beautiful. What did surprise me however was the numerous Hindu temples.Pic: Beautiful Buddhist buildings clicked from Wat Arun'

S' I currently work for Microsoft in Redmond. In the on-campus placements, I got placed at Epic Systems in Wisconsin (USA) and transitioned recently to MS. I have also interviewed onsite with Google, Facebook, Amazon and Yelp at their head-offices (and know many friends who work there). I can provide you an overview to the various questions you\'ve asked-- about the package itself, short-listing criterion, interview process, interview preparation and a little bit on non-CS related careers which are equally lucrative. I can\'t claim authority on the question of "non premier institutes" although I have provided some second-hand information. If you don\'t want to prepare for coding interviews, feel free to skip the section pertaining to it. The Package DisclaimerThe news articles represented much inflated figures, as they include one-time payments like joining bonus, relocation bonus as well as stock options with 4-5 year vesting cycle and pass it off as annual package. The base annual salary for new hires is mostly uniform across companies at about ~$100,000. Sometimes backdoor negotiations with multiple offers can increase it slightly. However the taxes are much higher than India. In states like California, there is a state tax of ~ 9.5% (thankfully it\'s 0% in Washington) bumping the taxes to > $30,000 annually. Also cost-of-living is way higher. The post-tax annual salary is around Rs. 35 lakh (if directly converted) which is much lesser than dream figure of Rs 1 crore +. I\'m not saying all this because I get lower (I don\'t) and therefore am trying to pull them down. I\'m just trying to let people know to base comparisons against more realistic figures, and know what you\'re signing for. There are certain finance companies in India that offer amounts like that (Goldman Sachs, WorldQuant, Tower Research Capital) which pay almost that much in India so if earning a lot and saving is primary interest I\'d recommend trying those options out. Read more on this here in this brilliant article by Antariksh Bothale.ShortlistingAnyways if you still want to know about these (high-tech) jobs irrespective of the disclaimer, read my answer to How do I get a H1B visa to immigrate from India to the Silicon Valley? It\'s a pretty enumerative list of how to get noticed by these big companies. For on-campus placements, the usual way of shortlisting is two-fold with filtering students based on GPA cutoff, and then conducting a coding exam. There are generally 2-3 coding questions requiring compilation, alongside few objective questions. Ones with best solutions (compiles quickly, no errors, few warnings, passes most test cases) make the interview. Outside of campus, as mentioned in other answer some ways to get noticed are HackerRank, Github contributions etc. The most common way is to get referred by a company insider (friend/ex-colleague). Have a good resume, with 1-2 internships at least, something noteworthy and there\'s a very good chance of hearing back from some member of their HR department. Frankly, I\'ve had almost zero luck in posting my resume on careers@x.com,so I would be fooling anyone by recommending that. It might work, but isn\'t great for beginner levels. However I\'ve to admit that I don\'t know more of the protocol from "non-premier institutes" although I\'ve lots of peers who are from them, mostly via Master\'s route. Also maintaining a LinkedIn profile is good for this purpose.InterviewsExcept for on-campus application, you\'ll be subjected to phone interviews. There will be more of these if you\'re in India than in US already. The questions (and format) will almost resemble the later interviews. After 2 or more rounds, if they find your knowledge of CS concepts to be good enough they\'ll fly you to their onsite (although I\'ve heard at times conducting interview in India offices). Here typically in a day there will be 4-5 interviews of 45 minutes each. With an initial introduction of some work you\'ve done- a project with some questions like "what would you have done differently", "challenges" and suchlike the interviewer proceeds to do a "technical question". This is typically a question based on data structures/ algorithms and you\'re required to write code on the white-board while explaining what you\'re writing. Code needn\'t be syntactically perfect, but it\'s good to be as close as possible. You can find most of these questions online, and with enough practice (1-2 months) new questions won\'t be too challenging as well. However interviewers ask follow-up questions altering constraints, asking scalable solutions etc. If you have memorized solutions to questions, this is a likely avenue for getting stuck as these questions tend to depend on the direction the conversation took. Interviews are wrapped with typically 5 minutes remaining for "do you have any questions from us?". It may feel repetitive as the candidate to ask similar questions, but still ask. This will demonstrate genuine curiosity in the company, work-culture. In short, this is the part where you demonstrate not being desperate and one where you\'re asking them to sell the company to you. A non-snarky and non-desperate attitude goes a long way. How to PrepareIf you haven\'t already, read a complete DS/algorithms book. I\'d read Data Structures and Algorithms in Java: Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia during my college placements. If you can (not required necessarily), do try Introduction to Algorithms. This creates a firm base for trying out questions. Practice some of the common algorithms by writing code for them. Have a package for each of the common data structures in your local machine in any language of your choice (preferable if it is C/ C++ / C# /Java/ Python). Write working code for standard algorithms for each of these- for example, for binary trees, write working methods for tree traversal algorithms, try various inputs and see it works as expected. For linked lists, write code to reverse it; for graphs, traversal such as BFS, DFS as well as Djikstra\'s. Meanwhile, you can pick up the book Cracking the Coding Interview to see how you can reason through questions, and when you get stuck how the author drives the thought process underlining assumptions and method. I\'d advice doing all 150 problems in the book multiple times, and by coding them rather than just thinking algorithm in head. In parallel, you can also start looking for other resources such as geeksforgeeks.com, Leetcode OJ. I didn\'t do much of the former, more of the latter as compiled code gives confidence. At this stage itself, you should be prepared. Apart from these, do read a little bit on threads/ processes/ networking/OS concepts. If you get a question on these, you can be frank and declare not knowing them in much detail. When you\'re confident of all this, do practice your resume. Although it\'s frowned upon to have a tailored answer to "tell me about yourself" it\'s better than not having practiced at all. Remember the question is a shorthand for "why should I hire you?". You shouldn\'t be telling the interviewer about your interests in football. Finally go through the answers from Gayle Laakmann McDowell on Quora.[1] She has multiple times laid emphasis on the perspective of the interviewer. Lots more answers here on the topic: What should I expect in a Software Engineer interview at Google and how should I prepare?Non-Coding CareersOne of my best friends worked in EXL as a Business Analyst. They moved him to NYC after 1.5 years. Then he switched jobs further (in banking), and makes similar sum of money as you posit. Many of the companies which come on-campus offer such opportunities, and give good compensation within India. However for Goldman Sachs, WorldQuant etc. I think it\'s very unlikely they consider candidates from non-premier institutes without high GPA and it helps to attempt MBA from IIMs if you don\'t meet the criterion. For consulting companies, the interview process is based a lot more on soft-skills. For analytics, it\'s based on puzzles (Tech Interview). Since I don\'t work for these, I\'d advice seeking advice from someone else in these lines. But the bottomline is over a period of few years, these fields offer very lucrative careers. Especially within India, some of them are more lucrative compensation-wise than Google, Microsoft offers. Personal caseAs I can see people asking me anyhow on my specific case, I didn\'t have a major in CS, but Mathematics & Computing from IIT-Delhi. I didn\'t have a particularly high GPA (~ 7.5/10). During on-campus placements, I\'d not read from so many sources. I just did well enough to get through Epic\'s coding exam and interview. When I began reapplying within US, I got interviews in Google, FB, Microsoft, Amazon via referrals from friends/ batchmates. I guess the best thing on my resume was an IEEE publication. I made it to onsite of all these companies + 3 more. Got offered a software developer position for MS Excel. Accepted it. Anyhow, the point is I am by no means coding in my sleep, nor have attempted any competitive programming ever. I\'m as average as programmer can get. However I was pretty good on the mathematics side of things. Basically: if you can develop thinking process to reasonable level + learn how to code, it\'s manageable to get hired for these packages. Without an elite college, GitHub and Stack Overflow participation helps.[1] http://www.quora.com/Gayle-Laakmann-McDowell/answers/Career-Advice'

S' Mac might be great for someone who\'s never used a computer- for dummies. Getting all that fancy stuff, sexy interface, intuitive UI etc. Mac might also be excellent for high-end users who use their PCs/laptops for lots of fancy stuff. What you\'ve remaining is the large middle-area of the bell-curve: people like me who are neither dummies, nor use it to perform high computational tasks and most importantly have grown up on Windows. Most people who can afford a Mac today (the question\'s target audience) couldn\'t at some point in their life, when they were using Windows. Today I can afford Mac, iPhone etc but a year back in college I wouldn\'t have been able (except by incurring huge debt which I wasn\'t willing to) which means most of my life I\'ve used primarily Windows. So now that we\'ve established a large section of "people who can afford Macs" grew up on Windows due to cost/ whatever reasons, let\'s see why we don\'t migrate to Mac on getting money. The few times I\'d to use a Mac I discovered there was a non-trivial learning curve. So essentially in order to start using Macs, I\'d have to invest time, energy and (significantly more) money. The incremental benefit I get out of making this switch is not worth it in my opinion. I get a cooler interface, sexier way to navigate, sleek body and possibly an entry into the "Apple users" club. I don\'t need any of it badly, thanks a lot or there are ways to get it with lesser investment. An important thing to remember is the use cases. As a low-end (or not high-end user), the typical tasks I\'d use my machine is for-- browsing the internet, listening to music, occasionally playing games/watching movies. Turns out if I need to do anything apart from this, MS Office mostly has the answer (because I don\'t do any fancy stuff*). I don\'t play with RAM/disks, nor understand the specs and very high performance doesn\'t make a big difference to me for the tasks I do. They run fine enough to get things done. I suspect this is somewhat representative of the typical user from middle of the bell-curve. The only instance personally where I was convinced Windows wasn\'t fit for the task was when I started using my machine for programming. Did I spend $ 1000 for a Mac? No, I downloaded Linux for free, got a dual OS partition in my cheap Dell and guess what- I get the real Unix, no viruses and I am richer by not spending. There was a learning curve for sure, but the lack of additional money justified the effort combined with the fact it was no more difficult than programming itself. When I needed to play games/ use Office suites (LibreOffice was a pain) I used Windows, else Linux (mainly to stay virus-safe). Eventually I switched back to Windows full-time. So to summarize- I\'ve no pressing need to migrate from my current platforms and when I will, I\'ll look for the cheapest alternative to get the task done. Just because I earn enough to afford stuff doesn\'t mean I have to spend it on stuff I don\'t need.Also a final point worth adding. The feeling of pity Apple users have for others with the question "why would anyone not buy Mac" gives non-Apple users enough reasons to not associate with the brand.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------* MS Office can do lots of fancy stuff, I don\'t use it for that though'

S' Some things to know before discussing methods. First of all, H1B is a non-immigrant visa meaning one\'s status on the visa is "legal non-resident alien". Another thing is H1B\'s are really tight these days. There\'s been various proposals to increase the cap, but neither party has it as a priority item on agenda so even after getting a H1B sponsor, there are chances of rejection by visa lottery system which happens in April. Having said that, these are some of the common methods to immigrate from India to SV:If you\'re a college student currently, majoring in CS (or math) from one of the premier institutions (IITs, BITS, IIIT) some of the best companies will come to your campus placements. If you\'re really good, they will hire you to their US offices. Study a lot of CS concepts: DS, algos, interview questions and excel the interviews. If you aren\'t from a premier institution but still majoring in CS (or related), get on to one of the websites like topcoder, HackerRank. Then start coding. This will require months to years of hard-work. When your score reaches high levels, you catch attention of potential employers who might give interview offers. Get selected through process. Get into India offices of one of the good tech companies. It\'s by no means trivial, but lack of visa requirements will tilt things more in your favor given experience with good projects. If you perform really well, they can send you to offices in US. After working for > 1 year, you can even go on L-1, which doesn\'t require lotteries.One of the most widely followed route- get admitted into Master\'s degree in US. Preferably CS/math/electrical since you asked Silicon Valley. Most people don\'t get scholarships or make to MIT/Princeton. Don\'t worry, go for it. F-1 visa provides flexible options to work as a RA in the university, and lots of people earn just enough to live efficiently. It\'s much easier to get placed to Valley with a US degree, a part of which is flexibility given by OPT period (which Obama is supposedly increasing), evading rigid cap of H1B lotteries and physical proximity over India for handling logistics. Lastly, a very common route. Take job in one of the IT consulting firms, or do any development work at your day-job in India for a few years. Companies like Infosys, TCS, Wipro send few of their employees every year at their US/UK offices to fill in roles. Alternately after few years of experience (3-5) post your resume on Dice.com. Lots of body shops hang around on that website, and offer "contract positions". Their target market is OPT-candidates as well as Indian employees with few years IT experience on some platforms who are desperate to come to US. Most of them won\'t be in Valley. However once you\'ve entered US on a H1B, it\'s much easier to get a H1B transfer than going through lottery from India. These are the most commonly used methods for getting a H1B. I definitely am not a fan of the last one, as it\'s one of the reasons visa reforms in big tech are stalled, plus they consume 80% of the visa applications every year leading to lots of rejections for others, but I am just providing the methods to immigrate- I\'ll leave the judgement to the reader.'

S' I\'d tweak the question a bit without destroying the sense. While growing up & in college, I\'d always been intrigued by the thought of being able to work for Google/ Microsoft (I changed FB to MS-- Google,FB,MS, Amazon anyways comprise the "top 4" for software devs from top colleges). The reasons I give might differ from an American perspective, since I don\'t have experience of growing up in US. Also I\'d provide with reasons why people are obsessed about working for these companies than actually the reasons people choose to work for them. Mostly the super-amazing developers who have multitude of options move-on pretty quickly from dying to work at Google/FB/MS and look towards startups for great learning capability, amazing peers. So I\'ll focus on other mere mortals like me and David Frye who are amused by the idea of working there from long before. Of course it goes without saying the great advertised perks, the consistent ability to make lists of "best places to work for" [1] lists and great compensation are reasons. Add to it, these companies are known for treating their tech employees with great respect--keeping them away from interference with MBAs, lesser non-sensical rules (dress code, timing rules) and it adds up to the aura. There, I said it- the reason which makes people go gaga over working for them. The aura. But of course, why Google and MS have this aura? For me, the answer is because I have grown up with Google and Microsoft.  While growing up, I remember Microsoft brought me exposure to computers and tons of software (Office, Media Player, Encarta, IE etc) while Google made me comfortable wading through the internet. And it didn\'t end there- these companies kept going crazy competing and making more awesome stuff, with better browsers, chat/ messengers, email, maps, blogger. Even my first bits of "programming" was fiddling with MS-DOS and (MS) VB6. Even though there were many instances of Blue Screen of Death, hard-disk crashes; overall impact Windows had on my life was way more, as well as my inclination to experiment with tools like PPT creating animations with sports, cartoons. Irrespective of whether the companies continued to innovate after that, at about age 17/18 the charm with them was deeply sealed along with the fascination "what would be it like to work for these amazing guys?" at a time when I could thankfully make the choice of choosing math + CS major. Google\'s amazing acquisitions including YouTube, Android as well as amazing products [2] including Nexus, Google Earth, driverless cars kept my fascination while MS (though slowing down and losing "coolness" to Apple) continued to make Xbox, Bing as well as great enterprise stuff such as SQL Server/Azure [3] along with acquisitions like Skype and Nokia (the other company which caught my fascination in those years, but they\'re hardware--which was too difficult for my small brain).So these things when combined did add up to validation as David says, but the desire to work for them largely follows an association with them. While other companies have to hard-sell to me what innovations they\'re making, Google/MS needed no introduction. I knew they\'re making impact (being a witness to their impact myself), and needed no stats to verify this. And as I said, being founded by hardcore tech guys rather than "sales/design guys wanting a tech co-founder", they enjoy a positive reputation among tech-geeks, who dislike management interference. For American kids, I guess Microsoft was old-school by early 2000\'s itself and they\'ve grown with Facebook dominating their social lives. (I know many Indian friends working at FB, but few have been obsessed about it from long back) I guess many people in the next 5-10 years will be indeed obsessed with working for FB as well as Apple for the same reasons I mentioned, of associating with the companies. So all in all, along with the obvious reasons of money, security, perks, brand name on resume, career growth it also includes associating with them and wanting to give back to the companies which helped change our lives for the positive. Of course as I said, this doesn\'t mean they are indeed the best companies to work for in terms of satisfaction, career growth, individual impact, bureaucracy, perks etc (although even in worst case, they\'re pretty good in all the metrics). Those things vary for every individual, and can be rationalized. But the obsession as asked in the question isn\'t a very rational feeling and that\'s why most people would jump at a job-offer from these companies (as a developer at least) irrespective of whether it will be the "best work" in terms of learning or even long-term monetary maximization.Ending on a positive note, I finally have been able to fulfill my obsession. I started as a software developer for Microsoft (at HQ) two weeks ago for Excel team - one of it\'s finest products in my opinion. And of course, the code has enough legacy, there is process overhead as you\'d expect in a giant organization but a part of me has been fulfilled by just being able to be a part of the history of organization which shaped my childhood.

S' Treat it as an entertainment movie where \'Murica saves the world yet again and you\'ll find it an entertaining watch. Like A Day After Tomorrow, Godzilla etc. One where scientists (and ex-pilots) "save humanity from destruction" (get used to this phrase, they\'ll use it so often it might make your head swirl). Of course destruction of humanity refers to some random American \'burb facing some climatic problems. Don\'t focus too much on the science part of it: either accuracy or even understanding whatever they\'re saying. The movie is spilled with intense scientific jargon. If you aren\'t a scientist, you\'ll be splitting hairs anyways making sense. If you are a stalwart: you\'re probably feel like this (Jay Wacker) or this (Robert Frost) or this hilarious review by Dan or Sandy citing observations with scientific inaccuracies baffled at the nonsense. Either way, you\'d be splitting hairs at the science, so my advice is to ignore the details and just trust the actors in whatever scientific they say.Also remember beforehand the movie is 3 hours long. It requires endurance for a mediocre movie. The maximum science you need to know is (in Joshua Engel\'s words from his great review) "some college-dorm-level pseudo-philosophy about how love transcends space and time" said by Anne Hathaway. Which reminds me: if you\'re one of those who like enduring shit movies due to the beautiful actresses (I\'ve done that before), Anne got a boy-cut so she doesn\'t look the same as her prior movies. You might still like her, but there are odds you won\'t (pic pasted so you know beforehand). However, keeping with her role and Jessica Chastain\'s the movie does pass the Bechdel test comfortably, so you can go to feel empowered (although if that was my aim, I\'d prefer watching Frozen).Matthew McConnaughley is an impressive actor, and he performs as nicely as script allows him to. So his acting shouldn\'t be the biggest of your worries. Also be prepared for some insignificant cameos from some forgotten actors (in Robert Frost\'s words: "weird American Beauty kid") and some famous stars with planets named after them. Don\'t try to classify it some genre. It\'s fine as a drama with all the family emotions. It\'s a good sci-fi until it all stops making sense. I\'d personally classify it as fantasy. The movie is similar to Harry Potter with central ideas like "love beats all", "saving humanity for greater good", some time-turner nonsense cloaked with some scientific sugar-coating of higher dimensions. Enjoy it just like you enjoyed Harry Potter.And most importantly, try forgetting Christopher Nolan has anything to do with the movie. That is gonna affect your perception based on your biases about him, your expectations from him which is most likely the reason for intense polarization. Treat it as another entertainment movie. Don\'t fool yourself by the reviews which tell you it\'s got some deep philosophy and forces you to think. Then you\'re setting yourself up for disappointment. The most philosophy you need is how love is great. Also don\'t try going too deep into what might seem Nolan\'s political advocacy-- there is enough self-contradictory stuff throughout the movie. If someone can use the movie as evidence that we need to increase funding for NASA, take action against climate change there\'s also enough scenes to give evidence that scientists are petty scheming creatures (wrestling on other planets) and don\'t deserve anything more. So if you\'ve decided to watch Interstellar (I strongly recommend to form independent opinions + fwiw, it brings science into public consciousness), prepare yourself for some great visual effects and seeing American flag on more planets for the next 3 hours of your life. This maybe a treat or a mindfuck depending on your attitude towards it. And yes, please don\'t rate the movie so highly on IMDB. It\'s not the 11th best movie of all time. There are even 11 Bollywood movies better than it.'

S' My memory is recent, so I\'ll give this one a go. I saw Roger Federer play Sam Groth in 2nd round at US Open 2014 in Arthur Ashe Stadium (Queens, NYC) on 27th August. He\'s been not just my favorite tennis player, but favorite sportstar for quite a long time and needless to say seeing him live from the stands is an extremely fulfilling experience. Moreover I didn\'t know I\'m seeing him till an hour before the match as I\'d booked tickets previous day in extreme hurry [1], so the added shock & excitement made my experience even better. Any live experience is composed of two parts: the performance and being a part of the audience (the crowds). I will detail them each in brief. Pic: Roger Federer (left), Sam Groth (right)The game and RF himselfHis shots in reality have the same trace of beauty as on TV. He came to the net a lot, apart from hitting beautiful cross-courts, backhands to clinch winners. The thing which I didn\'t expect was his serve and shots are really really fast. From seeing his matches on TV, I\'ve always thought of Roger as a man of elegance and not power. But when I saw his match in reality, even though his shots have the same elegance they also are extremely powerful in a way I hadn\'t imagined. (for a relative speed reference, I\'m comparing to the next match: Sharapova vs Liscki [2]). So there were many blinding aces. However due to hard-hitting shots, many points were won in net/out, but not by unforced errors. Pic: His great serveHe matched Groth in speed, outdid him in every other department. Needless to say, he won in straight sets. After the match, Federer spoke in fluent English to the media person, thanked all the audience and hit tennis balls-- one on every stand. The guy two seats ahead of me caught one ball, and I missed it by a whisker. Sigh!Pic: RF hitting balls to each stand, after winningAudienceEven though seeing the great is in itself a reward, an integral part of live experience is being part of a much larger crowd. So I\'ll relive part of the experience. The match was supposed to start 7 PM EST, but due to previous ongoing match between Berdych and someone, it kept on delaying. It was clear no one cared, but once they showed Fed the first time on big screen outside, everyone started cheering Berdych to finish quickly. And from here, it was cheers for Federer all the way. Even as everyone settled in their seats, snippets of RF would invite wild cheers. But it became extremely cathartic, when he finally set foot and the whole crowd stood in unison for a standing ovation. An excellent thing about the crowd was even though they supported and hooted for Federer with "Roger", "Federer" chants whenever he won points/games, whenever Groth pulled off a splendid point the audience was quick to show him appreciation despite affiliations. And there was no negative chanting for either, so it remained a great experience. Another thing worth mentioning is the Mexican wave (which was interestingly started by just one person in my next lot rousing the whole crowds). When I\'d seen football & volleyball live, the broadcasters encouraged us to keep going. Here as match isn\'t supposed to go on with noise, the chair umpire let few rounds of wave proceed and causing it to slowly fizzle by stern command like "thanks audience, time or match to resume". Overall the shared adulation for the great man made being a part of the audience a great experience. His victory was an icing on the cake.Pic: Me (I know I should\'ve got a haircut) with RF in the background[1] I was for an interview in NYC, and figured last moment I\'d get another day in NYC so booked resale tickets for next day without realizing I would be able to see Federer & Sharapova. Luck! [2] If you find a similar question on Sharapova feel free to send the question my way. Being a part of her audience has it\'s own quirks.'

S" This is indeed a very good question, which I've discussed with some of my Chinese programmer friends on multiple occasions. The question isn't really why there are no Chinese tech executives, but rather why there aren't Chinese tech executives in America. After all, Jack Ma (Alibaba) and the founders of Baidu, QQ, Weibo etc. are all powerful Chinese tech executives in China. So even though Jerry Yang (founder, Yahoo!) is a notable exception, it's true Indians have way more top-level prominent executives in US (Vic Gundotra, Vinod Khosla, Padmasree Warrior, Shantanu Narayen, Indra Nooyi, Vikram Pandit, Nikesh Arora) despite similar representation among programmer population.English: Whether you like the fact or not, when one is running boardroom meetings everyday, speaking to tons of customers etc language proficiency becomes very important. It's no secret that China has been reluctant and slow with picking up English, while India hasalmost embraced English as the lingua franca of the nation. This vastly affects promotions of Chinese developers in upper-management positions or as face of a company. Returning to China: Too many Chinese developers return to China to create value back home. The reasons although partly cultural and patriotic also make sense from an economic standpoint - due to the protectionist policies (banning Google, FB for long) it's easier to be bring local alternatives into the market without competition from giants. The same isn't true for India. If one wants to create a local alternative there, one will face immense competition from the giants (eg. Flipkart vs Amazon). Moreover, funding is much easier to raise in Silicon Valley than in Bangalore for completely innovative ideas. Essentially, the best tech-jobs in India are working for Indian offices of Google, MS. So Indians prefer to stick around in US, rise through the ranks thus having a prominent presence in upper management.No role models and fewer MBAs: Even though Nadella and Pichai maybe technically competent, it's unlikely they would have been where they are without their MBA degrees at Booth and Wharton respectively. Chinese people on the other hand don't go for MBA programs in US often, partly because there are fewer role models at upper-management and partly due to English (you need exceptional communication skills in English to be admitted into one of these schools). As a result, this becomes a further motivator to return to China (see 2).However it's noteworthy that Chinese immigrants from second (or later) generations are at much more ease with English, don't want to go back to China necessarily so they're doing a good job at upper-management (Yishan Wong, CEO Reddit) and even academia (Terrence Tao, Andrew Ng etc). The above reasons are also why there are significantly more Americans in upper-management in America than Indians/Chinese despite almost equal (or more) developers from latter countries."

S' This Indian is very, very glad about the award for the following reasons: 1) A fellow Indian wins a Nobel prize. Yay!2) India as land of peace: India has been marketing itself as peaceful nation, largely due to Gandhi\'s peaceful movement. However Gandhi didn\'t win the prize. No prize was awarded in 1948 citing "there was no suitable living candidate" and the committee said this officially:The greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question- Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee (2006)India: land of peaceful activismEven though Dalai Lama\'s prize was a partial compensation [1], Kailash\'s prize feels like a closure and an icing on the cake. It\'s good to see India consolidating itself as a land of peaceful social, political activism.3) Born, raised and citizen of India: Most Indian-born Nobel laureates have done much of their work abroad (except CV Raman/ Tagore), while the ones who did their work in India (D Lama, M Teresa) weren\'t Indian-born. Kailash on the other hand is born, raised in a small Indian village in MP. His entire work in based in India. An international recognition of this level buries the conviction that Indians can\'t do anything worthwhile by staying in India.4) Non-controversial/ apolitical: Although some have expressed regret for Satyarthi never being acknowledged by Indian media, on the plus side it means he\'s completely non-controversial with no detractors, letting us all savor the prize. Other influential Indian activists like Medha Patkar (Narmada Bachao fame) have found lots of support, but also immense criticism from various sections. The choice of someone who has an untarnished reputation (at least for sometime) serves as a good inspiration for others to follow.5) Role Model: This is an extension of the previous points, but seeing a homegrown Indian win international acclaim of the highest order will inspire many others to take up righteous causes. In particular, NGOs in India face shortage of funds, respect, recognition. With Kailash\'s success, we can expect others to take up the mantle with more confidence. 6) Child abuse as an evil: Fighting for children\'s rights is very important, and it\'s essential this evil be exposed to highlight international attention as well as local attention with the governing class, so that Modi can probably tag in children\'s empowerment alongside programs like Swacch Bharat campaign. After all, his government\'s entire emphasis is on having a skilled task-force which child labour completely impedes.7) India-Pakistan symbolism: Both countries have had their share of cross border firings and lots of people lose lives on both sides. Some nice symbolisms and gestures like this can drive sanity for sometime.8) A non-controversial Nobel Peace Prize finally: Due to having a political nature, the prize has been a hotbed of controversies with recent controversial picks like Barack Obama, EU and past like Yaseer Arafat, Henry Kissinger. Even though Malala is controversial in the same vein as Liu Xiabao, Kailash\'s apolitical/ non controversial nature is a much needed respite to the degradation and controversies faced by the prize.My only qualmKailash Satyarthi doesn\'t seem to have done his graduation from IITs, and thus questions like these still have no counter-examples: Why isn\'t there a single Nobel laureate on IIT\'s mantlepiece? or Why IITians are not getting any Nobel prizes? Sigh![1] The Nobel Peace Prize 1989'

S' Celebrated where? That\'s the important question. Others have suggested examples like George Washington being a slave-owner, Gandhi being sexist/ racist doesn\'t modify their overall accomplishments (democratic, peaceful world respectively). While true, these leaders genuinely contributed a lot and are perceived positively widely across the globe. However there are leaders with much less flattering records, much lesser positive contributions to humanity and way more harm who either enjoy a positive image in their territory or have policies against badmouthing them.Image: Warmongers with great PRs with sketchy human right recordEven Truman, Nixon, Reagan amongst themselves have led to loss of civilian lives in Japan, Korea,Vietnam, Grenada, Libya etc. Every country champions it\'s leaders who helps improve their lives, often neglecting hardships or crimes inflicted on who we deem others. Especially winning wars does wonders to PR of leaders. Even mediocre ones. Compared to some of the above guys, Churchill has a decent CV. Defeated Nazi warlords in gruesome WW2, saved Jews & Poles indirectly, was the last PM to oversee the nostalgic British empire. For all his negatives in colonial empires, he didn\'t create them but was continuing a racist tradition created by his forefathers justifying "white man\'s burden". Yes, he did have awful policies largely as a result of his racist views contributing to plight of many Indians especially in Bengal, during 1943 famine but then it wasn\'t Britishers who were affected, right? Churchill\'s task was to bring the best deal to Britain, and he did it pretty well. What\'s there not to be celebrated about it in Britain?You might ask, what about Hitler/ Stalin? They helped Germany / USSR as well. Of course they did. Except they treated many of their own people like shit, thus creating a faction within their own country who had great incentives to malign these erstwhile leaders. Also Germany lost the war, so German leaders literally had the best deal by seeking progress in partnering with the winners and forgetting the leaders who brought shame of defeat. In Stalin\'s case, power struggles made Khrushchev denounce Stalin to reduce his personality cult [1]. I\'ll quote a modification of the oft-quoted "history is written by the victors". Every country writes it\'s own history, propagates it and shouts from the roof. The winners can afford to be the loudest. The losers often have power struggles in aftermath leading to either desecrating the legacy of their predecessors, or join hands with the winners in return of economic favors (and winners want positive attitudes towards themselves as a pre-condition for help, which can be achieved only by destroying cult around losing leader than by glorifying them as a martyr). In Churchill\'s case, no British leader ever had the extreme need to reduce his legacy by quoting his wrongdoings in the colonies. Indeed it would cost them lots of political points, as none of his major atrocities affected British populace who\'d otherwise be thankful to him for winning the war. So his giant legacy (and will) remains.So why is Churchill celebrated? He is only celebrated by people of countries who benefited from his actions, is treated indifferently by many people around the globe who haven\'t heard his name and widely hated by people from countries who bore the brunt of his hostilities. Just like every other public figure (with few exceptions). So why do we hear the celebration of Churchill more? Stop consuming UK/ US media, start consuming other ones and you\'ll realize a different worldview.[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_...'

S' One major impediment to expansionism for Indian tourism industry is lack of women\'s safety. And I\'m not speaking of "few female tourists raped by some bad/uneducated apples". Other factors affecting tourism are poor sanitation conditions, as well as simply how overwhelming India is. I\'ll elaborate from my personal experiences of traveling with Canadian/French/American/German friends of both genders across India, as well as knowing lots of friends in US who have visited India and heard their experiences.Women\'s safety: Although faced by all races, specifically for white women the harassment faced can be extreme. In my personal travel experience, it spanned from photo requests every minute, clicking photos without permission, passing derogatory comments, following on the streets, being surrounded by disproportionately high males in private spaces, constant attempts to touch, actually groping, being harassed by police suspecting the girl to be a prostitute. The list goes on and on. And this is mainly metropolitan cities like Delhi. The notion of Westerners being promiscuous, open about sex combined with judgment call of it being slutty for women reflects itself constantly for a female traveler in India. As a result, walking on the streets even in broad daylight can be pretty distressing. When they go back, you know- they discuss experiences adding caution. Even I\'ve warned few white female friends to not visit India while young. The media gave this international attention after Delhi Gang Rape Case, but the condition was like this from much before. Sexual harassment in India: \'The story you never wanted to hear\'One of those girls who opened up with her horror stories publicly. Overwhelming: Now, this is for everyone- men, women, white, black especially from first world. India is a country where for a person used to peaceful environments their peace of mind is completely disrupted- all the five senses become hyper-alert. Visually, it\'s overwhelming as in all directions there are people, shops, colors, food stalls on the streets, extreme traffic. Audibly all of these are making noise (we are pretty noisy in public), vehicles honkering, the pestering boy on the street selling goods shouting and as explained before, the sense of touch becomes alert because there is so much pushing, and lots of people are trying to touch you (with good/bad intentions). Lots of this may not be bad in itself (colorful shops, for example)-- but the combination of all these put together for someone from peaceful environments increases stress levels. This backfires especially for tourists inspired by Indian spirituality coming to find peace here. Despite this, I\'ve recommended many non-Indian male friends to visit India as this is part of the excitement (and if it gets too stressful, there\'s always Dharmashala). A crowded Indian marketHygiene problems: Even though most of the friends I traveled with were eventually getting reckless with experimenting Indian street food because it\'s delicious, one particular French friend of mine was cautious and eating only from restaurants, drinking bottled water. However this did not save her from getting terribly upset stomach and having to go to hospital. Delhi Belly is for real. Streets in India are extremely dirty, and same with the water we drink and food we eat. It maybe way more tastier, but foreigners have a hard time adjusting to the quality of sanitation in India. However there\'s significant hope for tourism to be revived due to the following reasons: Soft power: India has immense soft power from Russia, China to US. Yoga is extremely cool in the West, same with our delicious food as well as the melodramatic Bollywood industry which for some reason excites people across the globe. We\'re popular as the nation of "peaceful Gandhi". Sanskrit/Hindi words find usage a lot in English. Despite it\'s negative reputation with filth and women rights India enjoys a great soft power infiltration making it more significant in people\'s mind.Hippy love: In the coop I lived in, out of my 25 housemates 4 had lived in India for more than 3 months, 3 others were taking lessons in Sanskrit/Hindi and were good enough at speaking it (all Americans). India finds a love affair with many Western hippy-esque people as the land of mysticism, history, culture and spirituality. Indian classical music delights them and the stink of toilets is not enough of a deterrent for these folks to bagpack around India. Beatles\' sojourn in India created a new generation of India-loving hippiesCheap: India is too cheap and foreigners just love it. Even though they\'re charged differentially for entry into tourist sites, it is really an insignificant amount in dollars (although for non Western Europeans/Americans it can be a pain). The availability of hotel rooms for Rs 500 ($ 8) even in touristy cities like Goa, Jaisalmer makes it a really attractive way to spend for someone who\'s saved up and doesn\'t want to be out of cash in a week or two. Even though a hotel revolution providing them with better amenities might attract certain tourists, for thrifty tourists India can be paradise.Therefore Indian tourism faces some major hurdles, some of which can be resolved by the government, but the rest will take efforts by the society at large. But rest assured, India has a potential as a huge tourist destination given it\'s soft-cultural penetration. As Jairam Ramesh initially quoted and NaMo reiterated we need "toilets first, temples later". The temples can get lots of tourists, but the lack of toilets can turn away more tourists than that for sure.'

S" It was 24th November, 2002.I was 12 years old and Triya was 10. Our parents had gone shopping/ buying groceries a few miles away while we'd refused to come along since we were watching Harry Potter. So while Harry and Voldemort battled it out, I realized smoke filling the bathroom in front of us. Initially it didn't seem very important as we reasoned it to be hot water fumes from the geyser. However when few moments later fumes kept increasing I decided to go and check the bedroom on the other side of the bathroom. Wow, and that was a scary sight. This other bedroom had a small adjoining area (like a closet but much bigger), where we used to store a lot of stuff. Books, clothes, shelf in addition to walking space. Guess what? Fire had engulfed this entire area. And it was flaming strong. What do you expect a 12-year old to do at this stage? Panic, of course. I started shouting to call Triya (as if it mattered). She came and we panicked together. Without much ideas, I started pouring water on the fire. In various installations-- size of small mugs (because we were too small to carry buckets). One of us called our parents quickly, and they stopped whatever they're doing and rushed home. It must have been a crazy drive for Dad knowing the house is on fire. Anyways it took them some time. Meanwhile I rushed to our landlords- who stayed on the ground floor (we lived on the first floor). Thankfully the father in the house ran to us, while the son went to other neighbors to gather a crowd to help while calling the fire brigade. They instructed us to stop pouring water as a short-circuit would backfire and make things worse. We all saw the fire consuming the stuff slowly, as others tried their innovative tactics to quell the fire- sand, cloth. What did it feel like? Panic, fear, dread. A fear which transformed from seeing things you value being burnt down to realizing you may not be alive anymore. A feeling of helplessness with the realization we could do nothing alone to stop the fire from engulfing us. Continuous prayers to God (no theism debates, please). In the end after half an hour to an hour of fighting fire, the situation was brought under control with the help of our parents, neighbors and fire brigade. We were all alive although lots of our stuff was burnt down. I am not entirely sure of what followed as I wasn't old enough to handle the finances, but I guess there were insurance claims filed. Minor blame games continued for days between landlord, tenants and insurance folks on the cause of fire, and to this day the cause hasn't been established with certainty. There was a constant sense of fear amongst us after that. Looking back I think of what could have been: what if we'd also went along for shopping, what if we'd responded later, what if fire was stronger, what if pouring water had backfired-- there are so-many what ifs which could have changed our lives for much worse. But in the end, those what-ifs didn't happen. I am alive, so is Triya. And I'm thankful to everyone who saved our lives for that. We could've cursed our fate for the fire in the first place, but rather thankfully we focused on the positive side. As the Hindi saying goes: jaan bachi to laakho paaye (lives saved are worth more than millions)."

S' Natural inequality: By natural, I mean an inequality which will exist in any economic system. The root cause for such economic inequality is definitely market dynamics, leading to more rewards for those who possess the precise skills required to manufacture and sell goods which add value to the lives of consumers. Note the usage of the term value to consumers, rather than value to society which are different things and the latter due to being highly subjective doesn\'t result in a consensus of what it is. So even if we might think a football game adds less social value than growing rice, if a consumer is willing to pay more for the former, the market declares it more valuable. Whichever individual possesses the necessary skills to design, manufacture and market these tools will reap more monetary rewards. Another important factor is the exclusivity of the skill. So let\'s say we all agree it\'s important to have dirt cleaned off our streets. Does this mean the janitor will be paid more? Mostly no, because cleaning streets doesn\'t require expertise in a field and years worth of training. There are many people possessing the necessary skills to complete the task, and thus the price for the skill lowers. This difference in skills becomes the root cause of economic inequality. An effect of this is market agents have no/lesser incentive to design goods for the lower end of economic spectrum, as it won\'t lead to profitable outcomes thus leading to what we call "rich becoming richer" phenomenon- increasing economic inequality. However this model of course assumes everyone has an equal opportunity.Artificial inequality: Unfortunately it\'s also possible to create economic inequality. Let\'s say a robber steals all the goods of a person. We\'ve created economic equality without any market forces. Of course we\'ve government organizations to redress grievances in such cases. However such created economic inequality becomes a major problem when it\'s institutionalized through a mixture of legal, social and other discrimination. Consider for example, a certain race/ gender/ religion/ caste is discriminated against and it\'s people considered dumb/ untouchable/ violent etc which leads them to be seen unfavorably. This leads to an irrational behavior where employers would tend to sidestep good employees with skillsets based on these prejudices. Sometimes it\'s part of a legal framework, other times it\'s not. Nevertheless the result is created inequality which isn\'t a direct result of market forces. As another example on a macro-scale, consider one country bombarding/ colonizing another country. The resultant lack of resources among the affected populace creates income inequality within that country, and an inequality between countries. Unfortunately legal redressals of such cases which have systematic discrimination/ plunder are more difficult than for individuals, especially when done across generations. Are the descendants legally accountable for crimes of their ancestors? The discussion inevitably leads to the discussion- do we need to fix income inequality- till what extent and how? In the latter kind of income inequality (created) there\'s more agreement that it needs to be fixed. Ending discrimination and righting past wrongs requires government intervention mostly, and the subject enters murky terrains of affirmative action. However the issue of whether any intervention if at all is required for the former kind- natural- is more contentious as it\'s seen as a by-product of a knowledge economy. The advocates of intervention mention the "false" assumption of level-playing field, equal opportunity and rising inequality meaning it being more difficult for relative poor to afford basic services like healthcare and education, which despite requiring expertise on the part of provider are seen as basic human needs. Both sides in such discussions have merits, and the question of where to draw the line in intervention is a challenge for the policy-makers.'

S' Meet this man: Morarji Desai, the 4th Prime Minister of India- the first of a non-Congress government as the leader of Janata Party. The only ideology uniting the members of the ruling party was an anti-Indira sentiment. Frustrated by the Emergency, having protested against it and probably incarcerated these revolutionaries meant a new progressive phase in Indian democracy, with no Congress, no corruption. Except he was deposed from within- by a member of his own party Charan Singh who replaced him to be the next Prime Minister. The ruling party had weakened enough that despite the ruthless Emergency his tenure lasted only 6 months, to be replaced by Indira again. There are striking similarities between Janata Party and Arvind Kejriwal\'s Aam Aadmi Party (and not just in it\'s name). AAP has invited some prominent personalities from different walks of life united by a common thread: their disgruntlement with the corrupt system, with the ruling Congress party; indeed all the political parties, police- a disillusionment. These people believe together they can change the system, end corruption, bring justice. All is well, except if we bring them into power so early without having established themselves as a homogenous party rather than heterogenous individual units, it will eventually collapse from within or be destabilized easily by opponents. In it\'s brief cameo in Delhi, the party felt the pressure as Vinod Kumar Binny resigned, alongside the independent MLA. In a platform as large as the centre where there is too much power at offer, the dissent from within can easily multiply. And at the end of the day, we\'ll be left with a weak government, crippled by Congress again. But all this was considering they came to power. In all likelihood, they won\'t be the ruling party. So the above analysis becomes moot. Then why wouldn\'t I vote for AAP? I\'d if Congress was the only alternative, but it\'s not. Neither is BJP the only other party. In all this wrangling, we seem to forget the underdogs- "the others". SP, BSP, TDP, Left etc. Parties which I consider much worse than either BJP or Congress. And if opinion polls are to be believed BJP-led NDA would topple UPA easily with over 200 seats, but won\'t have as many seats as these "others". So what we\'re looking at for LS\'14 isn\'t necessarily Congress vs BJP, but a possible BJP vs the others. Including AAP. Thus according to me, it is essential that every anti-Congress vote be polled towards BJP (unless one is both anti-Congress, anti-BJP where one can choose the alternatives including AAP) to consolidate their position rather than split BJP vote-bank from within and put them in the basket of third-front with or without Congress. Some of the possible scenarios as of now are: A government consisting of some of these other parties, with outside support from Congress. The mix may even include AAP. This seems very unlikely given current news, but a third front without Congress and BJP. May or may not include AAP. BJP-led coalition. However with Modi as it\'s face, BJP would find tough to find allies thus probably choosing another guy for the top role. Can be Rajnath Singh himself probably. NDA, with outside support from some regional partiesSo essentially in the coalition formation, even though AAP won\'t do much with the few seats it wins, it will be in a position to decide which of the above scenarios occur. Personally I dislike both 1 and 2 a lot, and why I wouldn\'t like a non-Modi led BJP-led coalition is because- 1) this coalition will face policy paralysis like UPA-II as well; 2) Modi has a good development track record, other leaders don\'t; 3) some of these other leaders are closer to RSS. Unless one is strictly anti-BJP and considers them worse than Congress as well as third-front, the best polling strategy is to vote for BJP. By 2019 however my opinion on voting for AAP may change given their track record in states, how much they can work as a team. Believe it or not. One of the main strengths of the Congress and why it gets re-elected is due to minimal infighting as a result of the dynastical structure where top posts are chosen by them. Stability is attractive for the central government. If you\'re getting this in your feed, but think you shouldn\'t try following the advice given here: Muting topics on Indian politic(ian)s'

S' Traveling alone in a foreign country is like being in a love-affair relationship. It oscillates between extreme highs and extreme lows, with long-stable periods of in-between often including boredom. Except the relationship is with yourself. Traveling alone is an excellent way to get to know yourself.Before delving into explaining, I\'d state my personal experience. I\'ve traveled alone in Netherlands, Belgium, Thailand and UK for about 5 months combined- all of it wasn\'t travel- and once in Bhutan. The exciting and the scary thing about traveling alone in a foreign country is it\'s foreignness. This matters much more if you\'re traveling across cultures. While every detail would catch your attention much more, the lack of company can be easily unnerving. However an important thing worth being stated is much of the excitement of traveling alone in a foreign country comes due to the people there, not just the landscapes, the buildings or the tourist attractions. Indeed if you want to see these things you\'re much better off with a group. What traveling alone does is it makes us desperate for companions. Which sounds scary, but as a result it offers us the opportunity to interact with people we may never had due to being busy with our own peers. And with meeting new people comes the excitement of getting to know the local culture, traditions and make new friends. Part of the excitement of making new friends is knowing you won\'t see them again most likely. As a result, you can be as silly and honest as you want without thinking a lot on judgment. Go grab a drink, a meal with a stranger, walk around the city with them with the added bonus of not having to be self-conscious and without peer pressure. The politeness of some strangers while traveling who\'ve often gone out of their way to help has impressed me, and knowing locals is a good way to challenge one\'s preconceived notions about the world. Pros: As I said, there would be no friends to "distract". All your attention would be on outside things. You\'d in a real sense exploring the place. Easy to follow your heart. Let\'s say you hear some interesting sounds. You keep following the source. There isn\'t anyone in your group contesting the decision. There will be lots of moments like these. When you\'re alone, you\'re on the lookout. All your senses are hyper-alert, because you need to combat your loneliness. Thus you\'ll discover lots of new things about the place and culture if you\'re alone than you\'re with others. Also many times it\'s a huge relief not having to argue on why the place you choose is better than what someone else in the group has to say.Picture: Random noises like these and following them can really lift one\'s mood. This picture is from Inverness, Scotland.As I said before, meeting new people. An easy way is staying in youth hostels, and interacting with fellow travelers. Other times it becomes possible while clicking pictures for others for instance.Getting lost. As others would have said already, this ends up being amazing. It kills off the predictability. It\'s like unlearning whatever you know and learning it again your own way. You will discover cheap ways of traveling, even probably hitchhike and end up in lots of adventurous things you wouldn\'t have thought otherwise. The point is- these will be facilitated by you being alone. For example, hitchhiking- neither will your group think of it as a credible alternative most times nor will riders be willing to give ride to a larger group due to space constraints or otherwise.Picture: Got to play beach volleyball with \'players\' in Covent Garden, London (UK) while traveling alone.ConsEconomically it can be a drain lots of times. For instance, if you need to take a cab for some reason. Splitting costs always helps. Similar for paying for hotels and likewise if there\'s no hostels available.You don\'t need to click photos everywhere you go, but it doesn\'t hurt to have one good picture at a place. Seeing these later will bring back refreshing memories. Without a group, it becomes difficult. Lots of places you\'ll be doing the selfie, before giving up for all the bad pics or if you find fellow travelers, ask them for help. Who knows it may help you bond with them.Image: Poor me attempting a selfie in Thimpu, BhutanThe biggest con is obviously though it is depressing. A lot at times. You see all those couples walking affectionately, groups of friends having fun and your own life seems hopeless. You appreciate architecture, but for how long? The lake is pleasant, the mountains are beautiful but alone it loses it\'s charm in sometime. This does happen. And is countered only by finding other people. Or groups of people where you can just mix in.I wouldn\'t advise everyone to go for it. In all fairness, not everyone likes an adventure with lots of depressing moments for learning something in life. To me, traveling alone is a high-risk, high-reward gamble. But if you do want to challenge yourself, and can go outside your comfort zone then especially in another country traveling alone can work wonders. In ways, you would never have anticipated. So if you can\'t convince friends, go for it alone.You might also like some things about Thailand that foreigners do not believe until they arrive?Bonus: some funny/interesting things that have happened to me while traveling'

S' Consider his resignation as a hedging strategy for his vote bank. Last few months have been very volatile for the party in terms of it\'s perception amongst voters, and he needed a strategy to contain any further losses. Arvind Kejriwal\'s resignation is a political statement signifying on one side the party\'s assertiveness to contest the Lok Sabha elections; on the other side, it\'s a statement to his voters of his frustration with the current corrupt system which didn\'t let him work. Resignation- when passed off as bullying into submission by big-wigs- creates sympathy amongst people. I\'ve been restraining few days to answer the question so as to follow-up on his actions. His interview (People have emotional tie with us but there may be intellectual disconnect: Arvind Kejriwal) is worth a read whichever side one is on.This does not mean that people have left us. People have an emotional tie with us even though there might be an intellectual disconnect. However, they are clear that if someone can provide honest politics in the country, it is AAP. The man understands politics. He knows elections aren\'t won by ideas but emotions. Especially in months prior to action. That\'s why he channels people\'s anger against corruption as support for himself. With his branding as "the honest party", he has made it their USP. The party holds such a huge competitive edge in this single agenda that even while in power, they stuck to it despite alienating voters who found it "cheap gimmickry". Nevertheless there\'s a limit to how much noise it could create about other political parties being corrupt while in power, for everything it does would be under scrutiny itself. To gain more voters for LS, the strategy was a choice between letting its governance speak or playing the anti-incumbency card. However remembering that the party\'s USP is anti-corruption and not it\'s governance model, it was a matter of time before he called it a day to go back to anti-incumbency. In the brief cameo he gave, his policies tried to secure a vote base among the benefited classes. Governing longer and giving alternate agendas would be suicidal as it would mean division within it\'s vote-bank. The Delhi scenarioHis support among fellow MLA\'s had reduced- as the independent and Binny Kumar had gone rogue. In the face of dwindling support which could have been very shameful for the party, he resigned himself which ensured sympathy as well as managed to turn the tables on other political parties deeming them corrupt for not passing the bill. The sympathy along with possible Delhi re-election at the same time as LS would ensure a pretty high vote count for them again, possibly even a majority. Resigning was thus a low loss strategy.If you think you shouldn\'t have been seeing this on your feed, try the advice here: Muting topics on Indian politic(ian)s '

S' The word which is the source of controversy here is "intelligent men". The question justifies the word with: "intelligent men hold more credentials, so their view matters". However if the question were "do many men think men are biologically superior to women in terms of rationality" the answer can be probably a yes. But here\'s the problem- the ones dismissing the lack of intellect and rationality in women can themselves be lacking in the same qualities so much. Indeed rationality is a rare trait in humans of both genders. And it\'s easy to see other\'s irrationality while failing to recognize one\'s own. Why lots of men see women as irrational creatures is because of seeing them as "the other". I have came across too many of my male friends making statements like "you can\'t reason with a girl. They\'re emotional creatures." If I try to argue with them on social conditioning and gender roles, they\'ll start laughing at me. Are these intelligent men? I am not sure if they are unwilling to have rational arguments on their generalizations, they\'re very rational or intelligent. However they exist in big numbers making themselves heard, but they may or may not be intelligent. Coming to the question of what intelligent men think? I have dealt with many intelligent people of both genders and been amazed by the analysis girls can put through on topics. Most intelligent people- of both genders- agree there are differences in how men and women behave, but it\'s not an inherent condition but rather there goes centuries of societal conditioning. It has lesser to do with brain differences and more with what their parents and other members of society told them to do while growing up. This includes reasons why females are more emotional, cry more and men are more aggressive, violent. However if you want to hear views of highly qualified men, I will provide you with both sides. Here is what V. S. Naipaul, a Nobel laureate in literature says"women writers were "quite different"..."I read a piece of writing and within a paragraph or two I know whether it is by a woman or not. I think [it is] unequal to me." "It is because of women\'s sentimentality, the narrow view of the world". "And inevitably for a woman, she is not a complete master of a house, so that comes over in her writing too" .... "My publisher, who was so good as a taster and editor, when she became a writer, lo and behold, it was all this feminine tosh. I don\'t mean this in any unkind way."Here is what Mahatma Gandhi has to say on the topic: [2]To call woman the weaker sex is a libel; it is mans injustice to woman. If by strength is meant brute strength, then, indeed, is woman less brute than man. If by strength is meant moral power, then woman is immeasurably mans superior. Has she not greater intuition, is she not more self-sacrificing, has she not greater courage? Without her man could not be. If non-violence is the law of our being, the future is with womanThese are the words of Barack Obama: The best judge of whether or not a country is going to develop is how it treats its women. If it\'s educating its girls, if women have equal rights, that country is going to move forward. But if women are oppressed and abused and illiterate, then they\'re going to fall behind.So it\'s neither unheard of for successful men to be condescending of girl\'s rationality nor unheard of successful and intelligent men upholding their cause. I work in a company founded and run by a woman (Judy Faulkner) and I can\'t help but notice her rational approach when she speaks. I chose a female professor as supervisor for my Math thesis for she was one of the better faculty members in our department. One of my favorite professors Angelie Multani is a female. I\'ve encountered many rational females to believe in equal capability although if someone argues society has conditioned them to adopt more emotionally-sensitive roles, I wouldn\'t disagree. However rationality is a rare trait in humans. [2] Gandhi\'s quotes on women- it\'s interesting at the least.'

S' Free software ensures people have freedom in using, studying, sharing and modifying the software. The term "free" is used in the sense of "free speech," not of "free beer."- Richard Stallman, The Free Software DefinitionFree access to healthcare is a fundamental human right. Access to free healthcare is not. What that means is no one should be denied access to healthcare services based on gender/race as long as they pay for the services. However as a morally responsible society, we decide to provide a basic minimum services to everyone who needs them, so that they don\'t struggle to merely survive. The primary examples are food, shelter, clothing. However at the same time, to provide services to these citizens someone has to produce these services. So to provide food to the people, someone has to cultivate grains; to provide housing, someone has to build the houses. Thus we\'ve another concept at loggerheads: cost of producing these services. As a society, the aim should be to ensure everyone has a basic minimum of services while compensating everyone for the services they provide accordingly. The following two diagrams reflect the two opposite ends of the concept- the first (Hierarchy of Needs) depicts the needs of a consumer, while the latter (Industrial Sectors) depicts the skills required to provide services for the producer. Ensuring safety needs of citizens is a primary concern of many states, so as to ensure they\'re able to produce efficiently without having to worry about these. As we see, health is one of those primary needs. Now look at the other diagram- while food production (agriculture) belongs to primary sector and clothing (garment) and shelter (construction) belong to secondary sector, healthcare along with education belongs to the tertiary sector. In essence, the cost of providing healthcare services is higher due to sophistication required. We need doctors to provide healthcare services who need to go through rigorous training for years to achieve skills to perform surgeries and examine patients, thus making them in higher demand in competitive marketplace increasing their costs. So while as a moral society we need to ensure no one is denied the basic needs due to lack of money including healthcare, we also need to ensure no one is forced to provide services (by law) for a lesser amount than their skills would allow according to the competitive free-market. Can healthcare be universal with fairness to providers?It\'s a tricky economic question, but the best way to do it is not by meddling with providers of services but rather reducing the layers of middlemen involved who increase the cost of service. Industries whose services provided are based around monetary risks such as insurance in healthcare or finance in education. By which I don\'t mean to monitor the profits of these middlemen sectors, but rather have alternate state-sponsored institutions where there aren\'t any middlemen between the consumer and the producer. Compensating providers is just a part of the net price, there are many other administrative costs as well. However the caveat should be the word basic necessities and defining what classifies as basic healthcare. Just like subsidized food wouldn\'t entitle receiver to world-class biryani and caviar, subsidized healthcare wouldn\'t mean world-class healthcare and free cure of cancer. The higher the specialty, the higher the cost of hiring the doctor which is from taxpayer\'s pocket. To summarize my viewpoint, even though free healthcare is not a fundamental right, as a morally responsible society we must take minimal responsibility to provide basic healthcare facilities to ensure no one has to face ordeal due to uncomplicated illnesses (which can be treated by a general physician) at subsidized/ free costs, while ensuring no provider is forced to deliver services at lesser than their skills mandate.'

S' Rose: How cold?Jack: Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over. You ever, uh, you ever been to Wisconsin?Rose: What?Jack: Well, they have some of the coldest winters around. I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.....Anyway, I, uh, I fell through some thin ice; and I\'m telling you, water that cold, like right down there...... it hits you like a thousand knives stabbing you all over your body. You can\'t breathe. You can\'t think. At least, not about anything but the pain. Which is why I\'m not looking forward to jumping in there after you. - The scene from Titanic when Rose (Kate Winslet (actor)) is about to commit suicide.As Jack wouldn\'t like jumping into the water due to his Wisconsin chill memories, moving from elsewhere to Wisconsin is like jumping into the icy-river. The cold stabs. Every inch of your face. And when you do have to walk in the open, it does feel like you can\'t breathe and your existence is centered on thinking about the pain, and how to get out of it.Living in Madison during winters can be extremely depressing. Each decision, every single day regarding social life during winters faces the mental barrier "but it\'s so cold outside". I should rather just stay inside.The image is not from the internet, but a photo I clicked in front of my apartment. Needless to say, I didn\'t stay outside more than 10 minutes even while photographing. The temperatures are way below freezing- I don\'t even see them with windchills because it depresses me more- but during the days it was declared "Polar Vertex" it went down to -30 degrees Celsius (-22 F). And it\'s very, very windy. Seeing a car skid on the snow while patrol cars helping them isn\'t an unusual sight. Relying on buses is worse as they get delayed due to the consistent snowfall. However there\'s no lack of sunshine. But it doesn\'t matter because the wind is strong enough to counter the pleasant effects of sunshine. It\'s only a view to be enjoyed from inside. And it starts mid-October to November and goes through March to April.Activities and social life in Madison wintersIn Madison, there are plenty of restaurants of all kinds- Asian, Mexican, Indian, American. The city is not a multicultural hub but 20% of the population are students at UW Madison, which makes it a very tolerant city with lots of international folks. When comparing to San Diego, definitely options will take a hit but in downtown Madison there do exist places for live music, bars, clubs while restaurants are nicely spread all over the city. As for living in the \'burbs- there are Middleton, Verona where rents are way cheaper but the more scenic part is near downtown Madison, due to the presence of Lake Mendota and Lake Monona. However in winter, even the lakes freeze completely making them good for sports but it\'s again a matter on being able to endure the cold for so long out in the open. Outdoor activities definitely get stagnated in winters, and beauty of snow also loses it\'s charm in few days when everywhere you see, it\'s snow.So to summarize life in Madison (or nearby Wisconsin cities) is really tough in the winters especially for someone not used to the terrible chilly winds and winters are a real hindrance to lots of activities you could have done otherwise although at least Madison has opportunities for social activities.'

S' Having featured in an interview with NDTV last year where I\'m sure I looked like a fool, speaking things out of context and was clearly agitated later for the miscommunication and distorted agenda on the part of the news channel, (State of affairs of Indian media (my NDTV interview) I\'d like to begin with giving the man a benefit of doubt. Were questions available to him? Most probably not. In my case I remember being misled to believe it was on another topic. So I speculate Frankly Speaking informed him the interview would be on the lines of "Role of Rahul Gandhi in transforming Indian politics" since that\'s what he was reiterating. There\'s a chance. However despite giving him the benefit of doubt, it\'s obvious he\'s not even close to answering most of the questions to the specific levels Arnab requests despite getting his agreement on the same. For instance, when after lots of circumlocution he speaks on the topic of 1984 anti-Sikh riots and 2002 Godhra riots- he tells there was a difference, but dodges Arnab\'s follow-up questions on Modi being given a clean chit, Congress ministers being convicted. He kept reiterating his words on "due process". Arnab gave him ample opportunity to answer, and didn\'t behave the way he does. Nevertheless he was quick to pick logical fallacies and inconsistencies. Rahul denies answering so many questions including why corrupt ministers haven\'t been tried deeming such questions \'superficial\'. I won\'t deny Rahul Gandhi\'s performance was -for lack of a better word- disappointing. Here are few possibilities explaining the interview:He isn\'t a good politician. Period. He involves himself with long-term goals, revolutionary ideas such as reforming the party, youth involvement but doesn\'t concern himself with short-term political strategies. Cool, he maybe doing revolutionary work behind the scenes but the electorate needs instant gratification and symbolisms and he doesn\'t concern himself with them. Nevertheless he would possibly be a good candidate in judiciary rather than legislature- given his respect for democracy, alongside willingness to implement fresh ideas. The ideas he suggested aren\'t very different from Arvind Kejriwal\'s (empowering common man, increasing their stake, RTI), yet he finds no supporters on social media while there would be AAP apologists posting "other side of the story" had AK been the one saying. Because no one cares- the youth has taken it\'s verdict on the man.Media anchors have their way of twisting the show so as to have the last laugh. Given Arnab Goswami (Journalist)\'s demeanor, it was clear he wouldn\'t let him walk away pleasantly. So a damage-control tactic can possibly be to divulge as less as possible. Every word a prominent politician says is a door to a new controversy. In the current scenario what we have is jokes and memes on his intellect, but possibly if he had spoken more, Arnab could have twisted it putting questions on his credibility. For instance, had he apologized for 1984 riots or accepted Congress role in abetting it, it could have given his political opponents points to use for the remaining campaign. So he chose silence and let his detractors poke fun for his foolishness than something sordid. After all, being stupid is better than being evil in politics. Anyways if you\'re wondering which side I\'m on. When I was in college, I read Vir Sanghvi\'s articles which spoke convincingly in support of Rahul. So I do believe RG does lots of empowerment behind the scenes, and has transformational ideas for his own party and if it was someone else doing the same, it could have won applause. Nevertheless seeing UPA\'s consistent failures convinced me they aren\'t worthy of the vote. Here is my answer to What did the United Progressive Alliance do wrong in its 2 terms? I am inclined towards BJP.Recommended: Dwarkanath\'s perspective on the interviewIf you are getting this in your feed despite not wanting to, follow the steps mentioned here: Muting topics on Indian politic(ian)s'

S' Yes and no. It\'s a wordplay, and depending on how you phrase it, it can give an idea of the intent. To begin with, I\'d like to point out statements like this aren\'t spoken in absolute isolationism, but rather with a relative reference. So when someone says Asians are good at math, they probably mean:Given a sample of scores in all math exams, the highest scoring ones consisted of many Asians OR given a sample of students in a higher-education math program, we\'re very likely to come across many Asians. Asians perform better at Math than others. Asians are inherently better at Math.The first one is a statistical statement subject to verification of it\'s statistical accuracy. If true, it provides an interesting case-study into reasons for the phenomenon. Often, the reasons tend to be cultural- related to upbringing, resource- availability. If the issue is important enough, once we\'ve identified the problem we can explore solutions. In the given example, we can explore reasons to why students from other cultures aren\'t performing as nicely in math exams. We can analyze elements of certain cultures which infuse mathematical spirit and try to design incentives to allure others as well. Interestingly, the existence of a culture which performs nicely can be used to provide the directions. So statistics like these can indeed be beneficial if applied correctly. The second statement is simply a logical fallacy- the very common converse fallacy. However it\'s the one used most often. Some other related examples- "in a sample space of criminals, a large proportion were black" is interpreted as "blacks are more criminal". Of the many acts of terrorism committed, many were done by Muslims is followed with the conclusion "Muslims are terrorists". These fallacious statements are spoken with the pretext of being statistical, passed off as logical arguments thus paving the way to the arguments of the third kind which are indeed racist and very harmful. Often it\'s difficult to note the difference between the first two. What we did here in essence was from noticing for a given trait, members of one community are likelier to belong to it (due to cultural reasons probably) we distorted it into classifying all the other individuals of the class to possess that trait. By doing so, we\'re ignoring the individuals\' ability to choose certain components of their culture selectively. So even if Asian culture encourages focus on Maths than Arts, an Asian child can choose to disregard it and focus on arts due to individual preferences. Here is an illustration:And the third statement would definitely be a "racist statement". There are neither statistics, nor fallacies. When something is natural/ inherent, there\'s not much an individual can do about it. For example, if I\'m naturally short there\'s not much I can do about it. Statements like these deny the possibility of an individual even being capable of working upon their traits when they\'re classified as being natural traits. Moreover it also imposes the characterization on the entire group, thus disregarding differences between different individuals in the community as well as denying individuals in each community the possibility of breaking free from the characterization. So if Asians are said to be naturally better at Math, irrespective of how much effort individual an Asian puts into his/her mathematical skills, (s)he will be classified as being good at math because (s)he is an Asian as well as being better than another non-Asian who might have polished their skills in math much better. How is it relevant in our world? Statements of the latter kinds become self-fulfilling prophecies into justifying oppression on certain communities based on logical fallacies. In a world where whites are seen as the progressive race and Asians as the model-minority, such stereotypes hamper other minority communities. Within the Asians, it creates higher expectations as well possibly. Since they\'re perceived to be good at math if they\'re as good as the next white person but not as good as the stereotype wants them to be, bad luck for them. At some level, it can also hamper white people if they\'re seen to be not into math as much as Asians inherently. The important thing is acknowledging any such aberration (if statistically true) based on race/caste/gender etc is a result of social conditioning rather than an inherent state. Not recognizing this leads to prejudices and unequal opportunities based on extraneous characteristics. On the other hand, dismissing a statistically correct statement as racist closes the door for discussion and improvement. Thus the standalone statement "Asians are good at math" may not be necessarily racist but jumping to any conclusions and calling it an inherent state will be racist.'

S' History serves to teach lessons, and in order to attain its purpose history needs symbols. Throughout human history atrocities and wars have occurred, but some stories have been more widely documented because telling them serves as a lesson to the future generations to not repeat similar mistakes. Hitler serves as one such universal symbol of "bad"- becoming an important symbol. How does Hitler serve as a symbol?A maniac whose hatred knew no bounds and who was willing to kill millions for his ideologies? Indeed, but he represents much more. Hitler & Nazis were merely a culmination of many things wrong, which needed fixing in our society. Anti-semitism: Hitler didn\'t start it. Indeed it dates back centuries, much before Shakespeare created Shylock in Merchant of Venice. Hitler merely became the face of the movement when he decided they were an inferior race and needed to be exterminated.Layman involvement: A disturbing thing about the whole episode is that Hitler didn\'t become Chancellor via a coup. (He was imprisoned for trying the same in Beer Hall Putsch.) He climbed the democratic leader, got public votes becoming Chancellor in 1933. Although the leadership of SS, Gestapo were comprised of people like Himmler, Goebbels who hated Jews passionately, the bulk of these organizations comprised of everyday folks. People doing their work to earn their living. These citizens of an industrialized, cultured and educated nation - perfectly capable of making sound decisions for themselves - were complicit to mass murder. Mechanical nature of the killings and scale: The killers were neither barbarians on the street, nor was it only the national military. Extermination of Jews was part of government policy. Sophisticated machinery - including gas chambers - was especially developed for the purpose. The process involved the government and citizens of the nation alike. Moreover it was conducted in an extremely mechanical way - unlike soldiers charged to kill their opponents. It wasn\'t a battle to be won, it was just work to be done. 6 million Jews were killed as a result, but what\'s baffling is not just the scale of the dead, but also the scale of the killers.Image: SS GuardsSo how didn\'t the citizens feel a revulsion in carrying executions? What made them justify killings to themselves? What were the benefits they as individuals or Germany as a nation was getting out of eradicating its own peaceful Jewish population? Nazism is a symbol of the power of hatred, propaganda and desperation which can push educated, civilized citizens into not just assenting to, but also participating in exterminating an entire race believing it to be the final solution to their problems. The reasons leading up to Hitler\'s rise make up for an interesting case study - loss in WW1, Treaty of Versailles, hyperinflation, Great Depression - on reasons which led citizens to justify killings, but in the end they were just immediate causes and none of it would\'ve been possible for the Nazis without the prevalent antisemitism and rampant use of nationalist imagery. All these tragedies in human history are a reflection of dark recesses in ourselves. When do we let our morality submit to fear, hatred and other primal instincts? Holocaust exposed lots of it, making us a self-aware race of what not to repeat. Is it the worst tragedy in human history?In terms of number of people killed, most probably not. Humans have been killing each other for ages, when entire kingdoms used to wipe out each other in quest for land. However what separates Holocaust from other battles is intent. There was no purpose to the killings, no tangible benefits being reaped. The killings were simply a result of hatred & discrimination. Yet the scale was huge. Millions of defenceless people across genders, ages were killed by another thousands. The "race war" unlike other wars wasn\'t a means to an end, it was an end itself. The fact that ordinary citizens were willing to do it for no obvious benefits reveals us a very scary side of ourselves. How does it compare to Armenian (and other) Genocide(s)?Probably similar. In the particular case of the Armenian genocide, it\'s indeed the second most studied genocide behind Holocaust. However if history needed one symbol to reemphasize the lessons, there are some good reasons why Germany should be the one: The fact that they were an industrialized developed nation, with high education, artistic influences in a modernist world is important. In times of current turmoil between developed and developing world, the choice of a white/Christian country rather than a (past) Muslim country is much more helpful so as to serve a constant reminder that the Western civilization has had its flaws and wreaked enough havoc once upon a time.Lastly, the way Germany bounced back from the loss is a symbol in itself. Many countries have done bad to others, but Germany has shown character by admitting to its flaws and making intense efforts to purge itself. Denazification, teaching future generations on the country\'s dark past and yet bouncing back as one of the largest economies. The character shown by Germany is an excellent symbol in history of learning from mistakes.Godwin\'s Law of Nazi AnalogiesGodwin\'s law is often neglected, often overstated. Not every comparison to Hitler is valid, not every comparison is invalid. The temptation to compare random \'villians\' to Hitler is too much. Feminazi, grammar-nazi? The phrase "Oh he had lots of followers, so what? Even Hitler had them". The acceptance of Hitler as a moral objective "bad" makes it tempting for people arguing to draw equivalences between their opponent (or their viewpoint) to Nazis thus proving it\'s wrong. Why is that bad? It kills the symbol. If anything and everything can be compared to Hitler (Nazis) it\'s not such a bad act after all. Hitler becomes our video game villian, the one we want to throw tomatoes at to vent out. And that\'s the symbolism getting lost - history functions to preserve the lesson learnt through Hitler rather than making him a pedestrian bad guy to vent our frustrations on. On the other hand, quoting Godwin\'s Law to trivialize acts which actually rival in seriousness (like Armenian Genocide) is a disservice to the people who were victims of those genocides as well as reduces the credibility of Godwin\'s Law. So the thing to remember is - each of these historic atrocities has a lesson to teach on what not to repeat. We can take them all seperately without comparing intensities. As for why Hitler is chosen as the absolute symbol of bad, it was because the entire story makes for an excellent (revolting) historical symbol.'

S' Good question, as lots of such trends are a mere result of Bandwagon effect. I will therefore try to provide my own reasons for preferring one type of music (rock) over the other (pop). My expertise on Bieber is low: haven\'t listened to many of his songs. However when I heard \'Baby\' the first time I mistook it for a female\'s voice before a friend corrected me. That in itself isn\'t a good enough reason to denounce him, but the music was awful as well and it was unsettling knowing this was a mega-hit. Nevertheless that\'s it about Bieber: I can speak of similar pop music (Pitbull etc). Composition: Artists like Bieber are primarily vocalists. Someone else writes the song, composes music, plays it- the artist just sings. On the contrary, the Beatles did everything on their own from composing, writing the lyrics to playing instruments. Well, Bieber is alone while they were 4, right? Eric Clapton did it all alone. Music: Most of the pop songs have indistinguishable music- precise same beats. You take out the voice, all are almost the same. No instrumental additions to the flavor of the music. My favorite among the rock/folk genre is Simon & Garfunkel. Paul Simon wrote the songs, played the guitars while Art Garfunkel added his melodious voice resulting in a soothing end-product. The song varies in pitch: the music with intelligent variation on instruments as well as singing without resorting to shrills and shrieks (which many pop singers do). El Condor Pasa by Simon & Garfunkel is a good example of musical variations along with soothing tone:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...The Beatles were amazing when it came to variety of musical instruments. They experimented with the violin, sitar and a lot more than guitars. They reinvented the way music was seen, and the stories associated with the songs make them more relatable. The music in itself is great, but lyrics contain great meanings. For an example of Beatles\' usage of guitar riffs, try out the song:I Want You (She\'s so Heavy) -- Beatles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Timelessness: Pop music is a depreciating commodity while rock music is an appreciating commodity. Sometimes I do like some of the pop music initially, but repeated exposure (unfortunately it\'s played a lot publicly) creates repulsion to the point I don\'t want to hear it at all. In other words, these songs don\'t stand the test of time. Rock songs, on the other hand, have various layers to "be appreciated". Every time I listen to them, I discover another nuance. For example, psychedelic experience by songs of Beatles and Pink Floyd. Try them with eyes closed, it\'s different. Try them with alcohol, it\'s different- effect multiplies. Many songs provide transcendental experience which means they allow me to get completely immersed in the music. In other words, they keep entertaining and mesmerizing even more with time. Universality: A part of it is very exclusive to me. When I\'m exposed to pop music for few minutes, my head aches. Not figuratively, literally. I\'ve to block the music from entering my ears to be able to do anything else. Such music for me isn\'t tolerable while sitting in a room, studying, eating, traveling or most day-to-day activities. The only place where I decide to tolerate them is nightclubs where the purpose is primarily to dance. The non-universality of this genre of music is a huge turnoff for me. On the other hand, I can just listen to music by Beatles, Floyd, S & G almost anywhere and it provides a soothing effect. These songs are not just for the entertainment, there\'s something to be appreciated. The universal nature of the songs makes me love them more. [Image: where pop music works best]'

S' Besides the theory of puppet head and conspiracy theories from blogs & FB (Anon\'s answer), it would help to investigate another reason why Manmohan Singh was the choice for the top-post after the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty and still remains today despite completing almost 2 terms and being 80+. TL; DR The same silence which draws him criticism is a very powerful weapon. Silence is a strong weapon. By voicing a strong opinion, although one may gain many supporters one also runs into the risk of making enemies. Most leaders at the top have high ambitions which results in differences amongst themselves. Ones projected as candidates for the top-post must have these important characteristics: Capability to win elections Influence with the top members Least enemies within party circles Now how this applies in the context of Congress: Projecting members from Nehru-Gandhi family as PM candidates has been demonstrated as an effective method for winning elections, due to the positive associations in most of India with both Nehru\'s & Gandhi\'s names. If someone from the family doesn\'t go out of their way to make enemies (Indira), they remain default choice for the helm. This leaves determining the next most powerful position. There is no "official" second-most powerful position, but when PM\'s position was vacated by the family (Sonia stepped down as she didn\'t enjoy the same support as the family brand due to Italy connection) it suddenly mattered. The decision had the potential of opening the Pandora\'s Box as entire top-brass would\'ve battled for the helm. To prevent this, the party-structure for Congress is designed such that the family nominates a person themselves. And that\'s where Manmohan Singh becomes the ideal candidate- has risen among the ranks especially with his success as Finance Minister, but more importantly would\'ve least opposition from other potential candidates. With his golden silence, he hasn\'t won enemies. (Image: Manmohan understands the above mantra very well. A quest to gain stronger party support by speaking may mean alienating few others.)Although BJP doesn\'t support dynastical politics, it suffers in leadership issue:Lots of leaders-most notably Modi- have risen among the party ranks with their hardwork. Some- again notably Modi- have demonstrated capability to win elections. However not everyone\'s persona- again notably Modi- fits with other top-leaders. As a result we have squabbles with Advani, Jaitley, Modi and others battling for the top spot creating friction within the party. Conclusion: Manmohan was chosen rather than others as his name creates least opposition among party circles apart from his good performance, which is an essential component for functioning of a political party in a democracy.'

S" This is a very good question. Discussing the issue requires understanding two important things: Education as a right & RoI: Subsiding higher education is not restricted to India. Lots of European countries have free higher education. These become good case-studies for need for public institutions or government interference in education even where students are financially well-off.Where the subsidies actually go?: Understanding the current subsidy structure in India.Addressing the former first. Education is considered high returns on investment for society. Not just in the form of visible returns like productive labor, but also invisibly as a moral, responsible member of the society. Due to the perceived essential nature of the commodity, governments around the world have debated whether privatizing it is a good method or rather engaging taxpayer's money. A major problem with privatizing education (irrespective of student's background) is with inflated costs (without subsidies) a larger percentage of population would opt to invest resources in lower-skill tasks- fields which landing a job quickly. This leads to an excessive supply of labour, leading to underpaid labour or high-unemployment. (unemployment is among worst maladies for government, as a productive but frustrated youth can easily be inclined to anti-social activities). (I don't necessarily advocate what the placard says)Higher costs of tertiary education- even amongst relatively well off- makes children dependent on their parents for the fees. In the West, it's considered good practice to forsake dependence at about 18 and higher costs of education definitely won't help there. In the Indian context (where it's highly acceptable for parents to be paying children's fees till end of college) the increased pressure on the family to compensate for the child may mean contrarily child having to compromise on the quality of education. Moreover with societal pressures & prejudices in India, many parents won't rather spend towards their children's higher education. Therefore governments tend to have a strong subsidy net towards higher education so as to churn more productive individuals irrespective of cost constraints subject to merit (that's why entrance exams). Where does subsidy go? It's also worth noting where these subsidies are invested. A major bulk of the subsidies are invested in fields such as engineering, sciences (considered high-skill labour). However within these institutions only a small fraction of the investment is towards subsidizing student's fees. A better picture would be obtained if one considers these educational institutions (examples- IITs) as merely research labs, where the scientists also dedicate a part of their time teaching students, who in turn pay for this imparted education. Scientific research with it's equipment & stuff needs huge investments and that's an area where private players don't specifically show interest until direct benefits are reaped. As a result governments become major investors towards funding research. This is payed using taxpayer's subsidy money. Along with equipment, of course there's the task of paying the researchers. A small portion of this net amount goes towards subsidizing student's education fees. ConclusionGovernments invest considerable sums of taxpayers' money towards higher education institutes- irrespective of student's (parent's) financial status. A majority of this is spent in just it would be in any research lab. The other small fraction is in ensuring cost doesn't become a deciding factor in a potentially productive individual's life while choosing their career path."

S' In just the words of the curious student who confronts the professor, "God" (rather than "evil") is like "cold" and "darkness". God is a concept humans have invented when there have been insufficient answers or convincing evidence regarding phenomenon we see daily around ourselves. Science by it\'s nature can never completely answer all phenomena because finding one explanation opens up other questions. We fill the void in our knowledge with the concept of "God". So in the words of the young man (with slight modifications): "In fact sir, God does not exist. According to the laws of arguments/theology/science(?), what we consider God is in reality the absence of scientific evidence (or sometimes lack of a very layman explanation to be able to convince priests). God does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no explanation of why things are the way they are."'

S' I find many answers till now- most taking a dig at the questioner by either sarcasm or rant. However I believe it\'s a valid question, and issues of nationalistic pride need not be needlessly dragged while reflecting on the concern.The problemWhen any community in an internet forum outnumbers other communities, it becomes a valid cause of concern. On generic questions, we may receive answers with which only the members of that community can empathize while others may feel left out. This community can be scientists, actors, entrepreneurs, Americans, (a)theists. One such community with the largest Quora population is- Indians. Let me give some reasons why this can a very valid concern: Questions such as "Which is the best X?" receive many answers which Indians can mainly relate to. Examples- related to Rahul Gandhi, NaMo, Bollywood movies and suchlike. Not all the answers come with excellent explanations of describing the choice to an outsider. As a net result, for a foreigner the whole experience can be baffling. (Picture: memes on them can be very confusing for outsiders)The demographics of Indian Quora is largely comprised of college students or young people in their early 20s. At our age, we hear a lot of opinions and are very vociferous about our own. Not all these opinions are well-researched and most times a reflection of what the media publishes.(very biased)Answers praising India in non-India related topics can turn on the upvoting instincts of our patriotic side and due to the huge numbers, distribute it to the feeds of users from other corners of the world.Some of us "kids" post a lot of memes, add irrelevant topics to questions, write funny 1-liners in serious questions and so on. It\'s not due to being Indian, but our age-group & high numbers play an important role. Most of the writers here are from engineering or running start-ups. We still have no military person, chef, prisoner, policeman, zookeeper- all of which can be found in writers from other countries- despite our high population. This makes the opinions lacking first-hand experience. Possible SolutionsOverall Indianizing may not be the best thing happening to Quora- however much the fact raises our heads- both for the purpose of attracting new users as well as for it\'s own commercial purposes. What can be done regarding it? Limit distribution: When Quora was released, only invited people could join- which is a prime reason why discussions on this website are so awesome. It can be done again. If Quora decides it needs to pander to it\'s Indian audience, it can send some invites to Indians from varied fields. Alternately stop new members until Quora gets diverse enough from all over the world. Spread to Europe: This is very important. Europe has an amazing history, an awesome blend of cultures, has been the home of most famous wars, has best competitive football and (well,before US)-the hub of popular culture. Currently it\'s the home of financial crises. It would be so much better to hear the experiences of Europeans on all these issues than having others write on these topics from our few travel experiences there/ reading. An exclusive focus on expanding in Europe would make Quora much more awesome. Since the population of Europe is anyways much lesser, it would be better to restrict new users from other spheres to give their voice a bigger say. When it has been done, Quora can have it\'s next public release.(Picture: Europe- lots of dormant awesomeness yet to be captured)My answer to Quora: What do you suggest to be Quora\'s main goal for 2013?Monetizing strategies in US, then India: This huge user-base in India maybe a waste for Quora if it can\'t get it\'s monetization act together. So once they have sorted monetization problem in their own backyard, they can test whether the same can be applied here. Being flooded by any single community can be overwhelming for a community which intends to be welcoming for everyone. In this case it\'s been the Indians- there\'s nothing racist if this becomes a cause of concern. These are just some ways I can think of which can solve any problems the current influx has caused.'

S' Anton Ego from Ratatouille In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau\'s famous motto, "Anyone can cook." But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau\'s, who is, in this critic\'s opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau\'s soon, hungry for more.I am not a fan of animated movies, but this one and Wall-E really captured my imagination.EDIT: As pointed out by Jared Gores, it\'s not the last line of the movie. I have nevertheless knowingly included it considering it\'s the last sequence.'

S" Filtering the good from the bad and the ugly in the long term. This applies to criticism for all art forms- music, arts, movies, literature and anything similar. Different types of works serve different purposes. Some serve to entertain, some speak on social issues, some are vociferous with opinions. Each of them is crucial in their own way. Living in a society where speech isn't restricted, each of these forms would be released in the markets leaving the readers with enormous choice. Though choice can be an excellent thing, as described by Barry Schwartz in The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less it makes decision-making much more complex. Bombarded by choices, often readers can't engage in deep analysis of every text they tackle. As a result, lots of texts with a deeper meaning -and often powerful commentary on society- get discarded over other texts which are more appealing on the surface. To avoid loss of certain powerful texts into oblivion, critics dedicate their careers into analyzing hidden-layers of meaning behind the obvious. When texts have passed this test of criticism, they're rated by the critics for their quality. Those which perform fairly well in these ratings become recognized and critically acclaimed. This labeling often indicates to the reader whether it is worth buying. Some of these works are commercial successes, some are not. By introducing continuous process of constructive criticism for art-forms, we as a society ensure over a long period of time the best in terms of social value persevere irrespective of commercial success. In the absence of literary criticism, based on parameters like commercial success texts of relatively low value can shadow better ones. Some examples- 50 shades of Grey has been commercial successes while commercial failures like Moby Dick found recognition only after the author's death. In movies it is notable to see Citizen Kane- currently topping various critic's lists- was a huge commercial failure while Men in Black has been a huge success. (remembering the great film-critic Roger Ebert) Why do we need to preserve such texts? As said these texts are rich in social value. Art-forms have always been a powerful form of expressing opinions, dissent and social commentary. By discussing them continually the society has progressed into it's current form- by questioning itself, exploring the answers through debating. These art-forms determine the thought-process for the generation on a whole and it's by analyzing them time & again, society can determine it's direction for change."

S" Sorry. In my process of answering, I'll be intentionally violating one of Quora's unsaid norms- 'not mentioning the same name as another answerer'. The purpose of me adding the same answer is not being satisfied with the explanation provided of why one would recommend it so I'd add the same name though elaborate differently than existing answer. My choice is Death Note.So what's so splendid about it and why would I recommend only this? At superficial level, Death Note is a mad-rush between two extremely intelligent lads L & Yagami Light outclassing each other by wits. We can call it a detective sci-fi. But if one wants to go deep, there's endless at offer. That too in only 37 episodes of about 20 minutes. The character of Yagami Light offers varied perspectives on wide-range of ethical conflicts: an intelligent, hard-working student dreaming of changing the world and weeding out evil if given the opportunity actually finds one. The series is a glimpse of the wide array of possibilities of how a well-meaning individual can detract from good causes with the availability of power. The series also has subtle commentary on mob behavior. As the series progresses, Light's character gets darker but even at the peak of this transition, the mob is equally divided into the ethical implications of his actions. It's tempting to brand Light as good/bad, but the realization that he embodies various shades of grey makes the anime a must watch.Review on my blog: Death NoteNote: To clarify my intentions again, there are questions in Best of X with one-line answers, to which the studious Aman Anand frames questions in the What Is So Great About X? topic for explanations. I thought we could do both in the same place, and provide explanations to our choice than just naming it."

S" Do ask yourself one question before starting journey of a quizzer: Why do you want to start competitive quizzing? Life at college (especially IITs) is hectic. There is lots to do: courses, assignments, projects. Why would you to make it worse by pursuing something demanding extensive reading, surfing and all that? Unlike projects, quizzing even gives no marks. Neither is there much money to be made and fame- forget it! If you're still listening despite this, you must be a curious soul. Quizzing needs curious souls and if you have it: then, becoming a good quizzer is trivial. You need to do nothing. Confused? Ok, if you want I will write an algorithm: Stay curious Attend quizzes (both competitive/ non-competitive) Don't give up <repeat> That's it! Curious to know why it works? Here is the 'proof of correctness': Becoming a good quizmaster is at least as difficult as becoming a good quizzer. Quizzers are a very critical group & leave no stone unturned in ridiculing a bad question. Now- what's a bad question? Generally one requiring memorization.A good question is considered one whose final answer is something even non-quizzers would've heard of- say Gandhi or Obama. Arriving at the correct solution requires intelligent guessing: eliminate alternatives or connect the dots. So the task of quizmaster is to make questions which facilitate the same for good quizzers. Good quizmasters would ensure you become a better quizzer. The caveat: questions often seem long, dry, unworkable. It often gives you 'I-don't-know-anything' moment. That's where the algorithm comes in. Don't give up: on curiosity as well as attendance. Like reading comics? Continue. Like watching movies? Watch more. Like sports? See more. Don't like politics? No need to explore it. Let it remain a fun activity rather than making it resemble coursework. Personal story: In my college (IIT-Delhi) there is a strong MELA (music-entertainment- literature- arts) culture in quizzes with the inherent assumption everyone likes watching movies/ listening to rock music etc. However I rarely see movies/series. As a result I suffered badly unable to clear prelims for a long time. It demotivated me and I quit quizzing for a long time. Nevertheless I kept reading news on my forte- sports. Explored more on it: on whatever interested me. I also used to read novels. Passive references to history, events compelled to explore some more. Indian literature motivated me to read more on India. So when I came back a year later into quizzing arena, I could at least clear prelims- it was all about curiosity. When I couldn't excel in my college- I searched other avenues. Tried inter-college events: won various accolades. By the end- though I am nowhere near the best in my college- I've won accolades representing my college, within my college, as well as featured 2-3 times on TV. And I still suck at ME(L)A.How to increase curiosity? I repeat- don't for the sake of quizzing. However if you are already curious and want to increase it, whenever you read 'something somewhere' or see some reference say in popular culture, do make a point to find out about it. Example: Homer Simpson mentioned Tianmen Sqaure. Don't know what it is? Keep it cached in your brain on things-to-google-next-time-I-use-internet. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sample question: School quizzing- Which is the 8th largest country in the world? Working it out: So you know India is the 7th largest country. Which is the 8th? You don't know? There's not much you can do about it apart from remembering some large countries in the map and picking some random one. Answer: ArgentinaCollege quizzing- In 1757 after the Battle of Plassey when Robert Clive defeated Siraj ud-Daula he needed to pray to thank the Lord. But since the Nawab had destroyed the only church in the city he couldn't. Seeing the opportunity, a group of businessmen/merchants organized a ceremony for him so that he could still thank God. Widely praised, it went on to be an annual ceremony and continues till date in India. What are we talking about? Working it out: Where is Plassey? Where was Siraj-ud-Daula the Nawab of? If you know, great- we're one step closer. If you don't, it's still not over. What ceremony could the businessmen have thought? The idea was to pray to God. Some religious ceremony? Continues till date & widely praised: seems grandiose. Which religion? From the scale, can be Hinduism. If you don't know the state, guess some annual Hindu religious ceremony like Ganesh Chaturthi. If you do know the state is Bengal, the answer is of course- Durga Puja. Answer: We had no clue, but we just worked-it-out. Yipee!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Remember: don't do anything out of your way for the sake of becoming a good quizzer. Read/ see stuff which interests you, go into it's depths, attend quizzes with an open brain and the results will follow after some time."

S' On the face of it, Holden Caufield embodies the struggles of the youth in coping up with the society, with the norms it puts up and striving for acceptance. He questions everyday norms, ridicules people blindly subscribing to these norms and sets himself apart from them. However what makes Holden Caufield a compelling character is one needs to go deeper to analyze him as a symbol. Holden Caufield is not just a rebel- he is a failed & confused rebel. Holden realizes what he doesn\'t want to be, but is clueless on what he wants to be. Holden is a negation of the existing societal phenomenon. He represents what\'s wrong with the society. But as an alternative, he is hollow. He is full of contradictions. He leaves his home, but doesn\'t know for what. He praises his Professor endlessly, goes to his home and flees away. He can see negative shades in every character apart from his younger sister \'old Phoebe\'. Holden\'s protest against the status quo seems more just for the sake of it than leading anywhere. Holden symbolizes confused youth- rebels without a cause. He is an embodiment of the existential crisis, teens and adolescents go through. Through one character Sallinger is able to represent two very powerful and opposite things- what the \'mature adults\' in the society do wrong and how young rebels who consider themselves unfit are unable to make any significant dents or offer any significant alternatives. Holden Caufield is an embodiment of the quote: "Every generation considers itself more intelligent than the previous one and wiser than the one about to come".This makes Holden such a compelling character.

S' I have been there, done that. I have been on all sides of the fence: respect, disrespect, hatred to reverence and have discussed the topic with many.TL;DR Gandhi seems boring. An old man walking across the nation with a stick and preaching love, non-violence is not cool to a hot-blooded youth. A huge portion of our school literature, history is dedicated to Gandhi. His autobiography, chapters in literature on his Champaran protests to lessons in history about Swaraj, Quit India, Satyagraha. The way the teaching is imparted is not as what Gandhi was- a clever politician who made idealism pragmatic but as a saint who stood by his principles of love and peace. To add to it, teaching methods were dry emphasizing on cramming to maximize marks. What it means is we were exposed to loads about Gandhi but never understood about the practical motives behind his act. We see him on our currency everyday. We read his quotes. But there is confusion on his worthiness for deserving all the attention. This is the phase when youngsters switch from respect to disrespect. If one doesn\'t read more, it stays here. Neither reverence, nor hatred. Some choose to respect, others disrespect.However if one chooses to read more on the Indian independence movement from works of non-fiction Gandhi\'s pragmatism shows and the excellence behind it. If one can see through the layers of the man\'s activities, the respect magnifies a lot. However if one doesn\'t choose to read, they are exposed to more stuff: Movies on Bhagat Singh: He features in a cameo signing documents sending Bhagat to gallows. No context is shown- Gandhi Irwin Pact, Non-cooperation movement leading to it. Viewers infer Gandhi being responsible for the death of Bhagat Singh. Nathuram Godse\'s emotional speech: Although it appeals to Hindu sentiments, it finds many takers. Safety Valve Theory: A conspiracy theory alleging him to be a British agent. Subhas Chandra Bose: His failed relationship with the revolutionary who was also instrumental in India\'s freedom struggle- SC Bose. Also unremitting support for JL Nehru are a reason of criticism. Gandhi\'s sexual experiments: Ideally it shouldn\'t affect anyone what he did in his bedroom, but his saintliness falls apart in context of these allegations.The problem is the methods by which the information gets circulated lacks credibility & it\'s half-baked. For the current generation the medium is online social media like blogs, Twitter of Facebook shares. Based on the amount of efforts an individual is willing to invest to verify their authenticity, the readers accept them at face-value or investigate & see if they can still respect Gandhi. Most aren\'t diligent enough to take the trouble of investigating credibility.As a net result, the youth which has been exposed to Gandhi-worshipping their entire adolescence discover his "new dimension" and switch to passionately hating him. To worsen things, Congress party- run by Nehru\'s progeny, having adopted Gandhi\'s surname- have worsened the connotations associated with the name as it has come to signify dynasty politics. To sum it up, youth has idols easier to associate with in 23-year old martyr Bhagat Singh or Azad Hind leader Subhas Chandra Bose asking for blood in return of freedom, and lots of online publicity of these great leaders has been done as the negation of Gandhi.Also read my answer to Why is Gandhi great?'

S' I am an atheist. I get irritated everytime a religious argument is used for constraining me from doing something I like of the form "You can\'t do it because God won\'t approve of it" or "religious scriptures say so". Nevertheless unlike other answers here, I will say the need for religion still exists. While rejecting religion absolutely, we forget the current state of morality we take for granted- which humans should understand themselves even without the concept of God- a possibility that without religion such morality may never have existed. Religion feeds on the primal instinct of fear within humans to restrain them from committing heinous acts which they would have otherwise justified as "necessary" citing circumstances. The fear of a divine creature who can punish these individuals is a wonderful concept to create restraint. Coming to the present times when after the evolution, morality has indeed seeped through within us. Do we still need religion? This is a scene of a slum in my country- India. The scene is not as beautiful as America. There\'s poverty everywhere. These people face misery everyday in their lives. What still keeps them going? Where do they get the hope from? What prevents them from robbing banks, stealing other\'s share of the pie because after all they are compelled to do so? It\'s this God. There\'s indeed magic in this concept. To wretched lives, words of hope sound like empty vessels. There\'s all the temptation to leave the moral, ethical path of working harder and get involved in illegal businesses- smuggling, theft. But they know- if they do God will punish them. And if they don\'t- God will help them by bringing hope into their lives, sufficient enough to live another day. So powerful is the concept of a God. Of course fear and punishment can be achieved through legislation rather than through God. But when governments take the power assigned to God into their own hands, we get authoritarian regimes like Soviet with bad records of human rights. Therefore having religion is a safer bet than granting more regulatory power to authorities for punishments. Religion/God are self-regulating punishments. However what definitely is not needed is mixing of politics with religion- laws based on these religious texts. Or taking legislative actions against perceived offense of any religious community. Else as long as poverty and miseries affect certain parts of the world, despite it\'s limitations religion is a safe-bet.'

S' According to me, the beauty of the book lies not in the character of only Vito Corleone but the presence of the marginal character called Kay Adams- Michael\'s wife. She\'s not a prominent character, thus not making it a full-blown ethical debate. This image will help in the analysis of Vito\'s goodness: On one side we have the towering character of Vito Corleone who speaks of capitalism, hard-work, how all is he doing is out of necessity due to the government being crooks themselves. Using \'survival\' argument of \'filling one\'s stomach\'. He also makes some marvelous offers difficult to refuse. The reader is enamored by his charm. Gambling is after all not such a huge moral issue. And then slowly Puzo unveils what these offers were- involving bloodshed, killing- deciding who was worth living (Fannucci). Nevertheless Vito\'s survival arguments makes us willing to accept this new dimension of him. He represents what we want to be- powerful person, who in his deathbed could say "Life is Beautiful". And that\'s where Kay comes in-- she is a manifestation of our conscience. A small voice within us nagging "But really, is Vito right? Do I want to become like him". And these small voices within us in the end decide for us how we perceive Vito- a good person or a bad person. Vito has numerous good qualities- helping needy, ones he loves- like his godson- Jonny, he loves his sons (other than Fredo), Tom who he has adopted. So dismissing Vito as an outright bad person would be inappropriate. He is not a bad person, but he has a compelling aura which makes the reader want to emulate him. He maybe good person- but what he did was not, and Kay\'s sound constantly reminds us he\'s not that good either. In summary, Vito like every human being has shades of grey- he is neither good nor bad absolutely and what makes the novel beautiful is manifestation of his both sides.'

S" Rapes/sexual assaults are not necessarily increasing in India.When I came across the question, I saw answers blaming patriarchy, misogyny, objectification, wretched state of women in India as reasons. But these are causes of rape, not why they are increasing. Unless the society is following a trajectory as shown below (or another increasing function) these answers are wrong. However what maybe the truth is we are seeing cases of rapes more often in the news. I will therefore offer a perspective explaining this: Reporting rates have probably increased Media has finally decided to highlight issues such as rapes as headlines Society is shifting towards acknowledging rape as a pressing issue. Now that we've agreed, our eyes go towards such news more often. Despite the dismal environment, it may represent a minor ray of hope. Finally women can come out of their suppressed closets and report cases of harassment. Moreover the media has been able to stimulate the consciousness of society for once towards a real pressing issue. So the bottomline is - rapes always occured in huge numbers, it's one of the most pressing issues of our times, the fact that we're seeing them reported more often is probably a sign of hope as media is finally reporting it- successfully catching the attention of our eyeballs. PS. I don't believe blaming western media for increased objectification/ misogyny serves any real purpose. Even without them, these existed very much."

S' No one in the world knows the true meaning of our national anthem. The only person who did know (Rabindranath Tagore) died 72 years ago.[EDIT: The original question was \'How many Indians know the true meaning of our national anthem? followed by the same description as now]Having said that I knew the meaning you put up in the description from a long time. But remember at the end of the day this is just a theory. There exist various interpretations of our anthem- this is just one of them. What\'s true is it was sung when King George V and the queen visited India in 1911. What\'s debatable is whether it was written for them. All these conspiracy theories sound much more pleasing when we hear because it\'s different to what we have grown hearing. But that doesn\'t mean necessarily it\'s correct.What does "Bharat Bhagya Vidhata" signify? Without going through thousand possible interpretations of this sentence, I\'d go with the most obvious one- "victory is in India\'s fortune". Every line we sing has a meaning which has a possible connotation in praise of "our motherland". It is left to every individual the connotation they choose while singing it. National anthem is nothing but a symbol. "The truth" associated with the symbol doesn\'t matter- partly because it can never be known. These symbols serve purposes. National anthem serves the purpose of instilling pride in citizens while singing it- which Jana Gana Mana does pretty well. It depends on the singer which connotation they want to choose. About the alternatives "Vande Matram" was proposed as the National anthem- but certain religious groups had issues with it citing idol worship(Maa Durga) connotations."Saare Jahan Se Accha" was written by Muhammad Iqbal. He was a great poet, was knighted just like Tagore but didn\'t die without his share of controversies. He was among the founding fathers of Pakistan movement- the call for separate nation. Every possible alternative has notorious connotations if we want to find one. Jana Gana Mana was the least controversial one at the time and chosen to immortalize our first nobel laureate Rabindranath, who in his patriotism turned down his knighthood. Any widely recognized symbol is bound to be marred by controversies.Conclusion about Jan Gan Man: There\'s no need to change it. Apart from the patriotism it evokes, the song has a wonderful tune. You can resent it by considering it a deference to British or listen with this video & feel the goosebumps. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Relevant Reading: What were some reasons why \'Sarey jahan sey accha\' wasn\'t chosen as the Indian National Anthem?Should India change its national anthem?

S' Family pressures In many parts of India, family still continues to be the decisive authority in issues relating to marriage. Moreover previous generations are bound to the traditional values of intra-religion, intra-caste marriage. If children began dating amongst themselves amounting to love marriages, the odds that these caste/religion constraints would be satisfied is low. Therefore families ask their children "to focus on their study/work" and not "loaf around with opposite gender" ensuring arrange marriages eventually. A noteworthy thing is boys are advised against dating as much as girls are against it by their parents. Most boys save the girl\'s contact numbers in their phones under some pseudonyms so that their "family doesn\'t suspect". If asked by parents, children have to constantly apply rhetoric of "just friends". In essence if a relationship is to be pursued before marriage, in most cases it\'s shrouded in secrecy from the elder generation until it reaches the blossoming stages of marriage. It doesn\'t end at family. Our neighbours are pretty loud-mouthed as well. So on being seen by an acquaintance along with a girl, news will definitely reach the family in subtler forms indicating "child is slipping out of control".When through "such sources" news reaches family ears, they realize they must rush & start finding brides/grooms for their child. Unable to fight with their parents, the children have to break-up with their partners thus disappointing the relationship & get married elsewhere. Since relationships before marriage is a new concept India is grappling with, relationships necessarily mean marriage for even the children. If it doesn\'t amount to the same, the party who got "dumped" feels cheated. Therefore they move into a relationship only when they\'re assured it will end in marriage. Dating without being in relationship is even more incomprehensible here. So they date when they know it\'s a relationship (eventually meaning marriage)Social factors These affect the girls more. Suppose a gossip-inclined person reveals a relationship started in secrecy, the girl is likelier to called a slut and shamed. Somehow family reputation gets muddled in all these things and the fact that their daughter was "going out" will leave the family "with no face to show". In case a thriving relationship involving sex breaks eventually before marriage. Both parties would have lost their virginity but it would become a bigger issue for girl as she is less likelier to find a suitor who is above immaterial stuff like virginity. (India: Do you expect your wife to be a virgin? Read wonderful answers & comments to get a balanced picture of societal mentality) If the relationship is made public, society (family, those uncle/aunts) start expecting marriage. If that doesn\'t happen, lots of slandering follows speaking of the "bad character" of their children- more so for girls. Due to all these factors, children have to be exceedingly cautious while dating for adhering to the family\'s expectations while avoiding sending \'wrong signals\' to the society damaging their family\'s reputation from nowhere.'

S" The explanations of Messianic prophecies would be no different from explaining whatever goes on in Harry Potter books.(Disclaimer: I'm sorry if I offend anyone's Christian sentiments, but an explanation is hardly possible without it.)*Spoiler Alert for Harry Potter* There's a 10-year old boy who can run through platforms at Kings Cross while no one nearby can. He can also speak to snakes. He can fly on brooms. What's more- he can wave a stick in his hand, speak few words and lots of incomprehensible things happen- feathers fly (wingardium leviosa), lights illuminate (lumos), people are frozen (stupefy), some ghostly creatures run away (expecto patronum) & even people die (avada kedavra). Just like Bible- here also we have Sybille Trellawney prophesizing the birth of 'Chosen One' who predicts he will the cause of the fall of the 'Dark Lord' Voldemort. Also she predicts the rise of Peter Pettigrew correcttly. It almost sounds silly a 17-year old boy killing the Dark Lord who great fighters couldn't ever. Thus the odds of fulfilling the prophecies is very low- nevertheless it happens. This boy also dies for few troubling moments, just to get up: a resurrection.Now if someone asks for an explanation of how all these otherwise incomprehensible phenomenon can be explained and how these predictions were right- the answer is pretty simple. Harry Potter is a creation of JK Rowling- her world of fantasies where all this stuff is possible. It needs no explanation because it's not true in the real-world. Coming to the accurate prophecies apart from the magic, there's also the element of Self-fulfilling prophecy there. If Voldemort never heard of the prophecy, he wouldn't have gone after the Potters- which wouldn't have led to Lily Potter's protective shield and so on. Coming to the Messianic prophecies. Jesus does unbelievable stuff while others can't- he heals people, becomes the redeemer. There's a dark lord as well- Satan. Genesis 3:15.....He will bruise Satan's head.....Hebrews 2:14, 1 \t\t\tJohn 3:8So similar to Trelawney's prediction. What's more? It's fulfilled. Just like Harry Potter all these predictions can be treated by atheists as a work of fantasy. There's no reason to believe in the existence of either Jesus or Satan. All these sound like someone's fanciful imagination. And just like I said for Harry Potter- these prophecies & strange phenomenon need no explanation because we don't believe it's true. Just like Rowling's writing Harry Potter doesn't make it true, writing Bible (by an anonymous author) doesn't make it true. Nevertheless there are some excellent moral insights in Harry Potter which don't need the advent of a God. Bible can be treated the same way- take away the morals, chuck the junk."

S' I beg you. Please upvote this answer, all my past answer & future answers. Do I ask for upvotes explicitly? Does it end there? Let\'s magnify into some of those links: Magnifying into the link which has been talked about in the question: Finally magnifying into the link I love upvotes:"But admittedly I\'m a narcissist- I love being read & appreciated. I\'m not content to be a submicroscopic speck in the vast functioning of the world & I want to know I made a difference while I leave. Upvotes does the trick."Have I explicitly asked for it in answers? Yes, in this answer:So you have got one part right: I do frequently "ask for upvotes". Do I always ask for upvotes? This is my last answer (before this) and here I haven\'t asked. Therefore we have a counter-example and hence the claim is falsified. Do I beg for upvotes? Notice the use of conditionals like "if" in my requests: "If you feel like exploring my further answers" "Want to extend your courtesy further?""Please extend your courtesy and upvote if you like" This seems like a humble form of begging. Begging differs in two forms: This conditional is missing. It\'s not like "if you like it, do upvote" but rather "please upvote". Irrespective of the person\'s liking. Beggars ask for favor out of compassion, not by delivering a service Considering Quora is heavily dependent on answers & my efforts are adding to Quora\'s repository of answers I consider it providing a form of service. I have indeed few examples of similar requests from the internet: From a website called LemonVibe stating: if you like what we have here, please like us on Facebook & follow on TwitterFrom our own Quora stating in one form: if you like what you see, please sign up to see furtherThese are in general called "marketing strategies". The service provider looks for "return on investments" (RoI). So my appeals for upvotes are closer to marketing than begging. If Quora is begging, I am fine with begging myself. So let\'s modify the question to "Why does Siddharth often ask for upvotes?" There are mainly two type of people: People who do what they like irrespective of returns- intellectuals. People who expect returns out of what they do- mere mortals. I clearly belong to the second category. "Are you feigning intellect?"No. I admit to being a lesser mortal- not an intellectual. Nothing worth feigning.Resonating words by Adam D\'Angelo regarding sign-up requirement: "We require that people join because many who join like the service & end up contributing back to Quora, making it better for everyone. People spend a ton of time making Quora great by sharing their knowledge here, so we think it is reasonable to ask that others who want to get all the free knowledge here take the first very small step toward contributing back which is creating an account."I consider it reasonable to ask those who read my answers and like them to take the first very small step toward contributing back which is an upvote. It keeps writers like me motivated to continue writing and costs nothing to the user. Why I value upvotes so much? As said- I am admittedly a narcissist (I believe many are, but don\'t admit) who writes not just for the satisfaction of it but for the accompanying rewards as well. I\'ve shifted from blogs to Quora for the readers. I\'m not content writing without being read. I\'m content only by knowing my answers have been read & appreciated. Upvotes is a signal of the appreciation. Moreover an upvote represents the standing of the answer on the question-page. And finally maybe some day these answers yield tangible benefits- upvotes increase my visibility to a larger audience. Why do I ask for upvotes explicitly? Many new users aren\'t acquainted with upvoting mechanisms. Reiterating requests for upvotes can often get them to upvote just like multiple mentions by companies advertising their product does cause buying. Conclusion: I\'m a mere mortal who loves appreciation. If you like my answers, I\'d again request you to upvote them. If not, no need to follow me. If they are still appearing in your feed, feel free to block me. But do respect my desire to work for incentives as I respect your right to ask this question which may have been considered "inflammatory". Also despite knowing you\'re one of those lingering in my hostel few rooms away from me (trolling), I respect your anonymity.'

S' Logic in itself isn\'t dangerous. It\'s only dangerous when contaminated with fallacies and passed off as logical argument. Logic is respected because of it\'s objective nature- irrefutable, backed by evidence. However the domains in which people (including me) claim using logical thought are inherently subjective- few things are fact (logically true) but everything else is debatable even though opinions may tilt towards one side. In other words, fuzzy logic (probabilistic in nature) is asserted as crisp logic (deterministic) thus retaining pretext of "using logic". It works mainly when audience doesn\'t have a thorough understanding of logical principles. Such people are afraid to disbelieve arguments using "logically it follows" repeatedly out of the fear of being deemed illogical.Some examples of such statements are ones using the word "necessary", "obviously", "of course" without evidence: "We have no option left and it\'s necessary we go to war." [1]"Obviously God doesn\'t exist, else we would have seen him till now".[2]"Of course God wanted humans to be heterosexuals". [3]None of these examples are logically consistent but each is used frequently citing usage of "logical argument". Establishing "necessary"/"obvious" requires that all other alternatives have absolute zero probability (not low, absolute zero). By deeming some action considered "dangerous" as necessary, we unfortunately do away with the guilt which comes with the knowledge of exercising a choice. Similarly we\'ve numerous instances of arguments using converse, causal fallacy, argument from ignorance for dogmatic purposes but quoted as logical: "Giving freedom to community X logically means taking it away from Y" [4]"All Y are terrorists because a Y was responsible" (Hasty generalization)"He argues X are smart. He\'s calling the people of Y inferior" (converse)"Our country has been losing out on resources. Their country has been gaining. So logically they have been stealing our resources" (causal) When can these arguments be dangerous? That depends on the definition of dangerous (subjective by nature). For me, it\'s when fallacious arguments promote violence, discrimination, hatred between people using the pretext of irrefutable logic and worse translate to action usually with the recourse of law. It\'s dangerous when arguments inconsistent with principles of logic are passed off as logical arguments becoming manipulative & divisive tools. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] Going to war is one option. Not going is another- which can be further classified as doing nothing, diplomatic negotiations, international assistance etc. The argument can be logically valid only if all the latter options are void. (absolute zero probability). Due to the subjective nature of the domain (politics) establishing these probabilities concretely is impossible. However the same fuzziness ensures these alternatives have a positive (non-zero) probability. [2] It\'s insufficient evidence to claim God doesn\'t exist because we haven\'t seen him.Alternatives like God\'s unwillingness to show itself, our inability to see him etc. have positive probability & hence the "obviousness" of the claim is nullified. [3] Even if God existed & indeed disliked homosexuals, it does not imply liking heterosexuals. (False dichotomy) Much less "of course" want that.[4] Despite it\'s compelling nature, to be logically consistent it must establish that freedom between communities is a zero-sum game. Not assert, but prove. The beauty of logic is accepting only proven statements. Until proven, statements remain hypotheses. This is an example of argument from ignorance.'

S' We would see the relevance of patriotism, but you would have to help me by assuming yourself to be the head of society- a noble person valuing economic progress and development as chief aims. Slowly you\'d agree to dispose of religion, caste but not patriotism. Let\'s see why.You\'ve the responsibility of taking the society ahead. What you don\'t want at any cost is anarchy. A society will slid into anarchy if either of these two don\'t hold: Lack of moral codes (political anarchy)Lack of an aligned direction towards development (economic anarchy)While the former is clear, the latter needs explanation. We\'ll come to it.In order to avoid the former- you preach some morals, create some taboos ensuring rather than loafing around & stealing other\'s share of the pie, people actually get to work. Meanwhile you want to maximize output from the people\'s efforts. So you apply some elementary concepts from physics (yes, it\'s not useless after all). Seeing these efforts as waves, you\'re appalled at the results: If they\'re not aligned, all their efforts can nullify each other and you\'ve economic anarchy. However you\'ve some hope on studying the results of perfect alignment. So your aim is to align these individual efforts. For that, you must establish trust amongst them. The first step would be moral codes:"Don\'t steal from thou neighbor". Nevertheless some don\'t take this to heart committing acts detrimental to establishing this trust. So what would you do when moral preaching fails? You make these codes stronger by incorporating punishments. To facilitate this you exploit the mysteries of the universe, attribute them to an omnipotent character and call it \'God\'. Now this God with all it\'s power can punish. With the newly introduced fear of going to \'hell\' more people start following these moral codes. However few skeptics won\'t find this God compelling enough to act in the \'desired\' manner. So now- you\'ve been tested to the extremes. Apart from trust within themselves, their trust in you is also essential. Therefore you intentionally kept away from exercising power. But with no choice left, you create tangible punishments for not following God\'s orders. Now everyone takes you seriously & gets to work. So you managed the regulations part. Unfortunately it doesn\'t end here. You got everybody to work- but still you\'ve to provide the direction. This is where you need to bring in incentives. Alas! For the primitive human mind fear works better than desire for lollipops. In other words, the regulations part is much easier than incentives. So what do you do now? Hold your breath friends, for here we introduce our masterstroke: You invent something called a \'nation\'. Tell them they all belong to the same nation- talk of brotherhood. Unite them by a common identity. Lo behold! People got emotional & started working in the same direction. But the story doesn\'t end here- slight twist. Just as few didn\'t take \'God\' seriously, few don\'t buy this nation argument. Unfortunately you\'ve to resort to the same method as before- fear. You tell them if they deviate from sticking together & working in an aligned manner, some other similar entities (\'nations\') would threaten them. Many more believe, but some still remain. Where are these other nations they ask? What do you tell them? Drumroll! For masterstrokes don\'t end so easily: You compromise! With another intelligent person who understands all this & tell him to \'invent an ideology\' to distribute subjects between yourselves thus creating a \'sense of threat\' by citing each other\'s name. So you both battle it out on a public platform in a heated manner, convincing half of them to move either way. On the positive side you\'ve lesser people to manage, on the negative side you\'ve lesser manpower. But the best part is- all people in your \'nation\' work in similar direction. You constantly deploy the rhetoric of how the other guy would \'attack\' if people deviate. To hold on to people\'s trust, you actually feign a few skirmishes. But despite these few tid-bits you\'ve achieved what you set out for- avoiding anarchy & rather maximizing collective output. All\'s well, that ends well. But the ending remains. To ensure moral conduct, you needed religion. This alone was not sufficient. You needed enforcing punishments. For this you need to retain the central authority allowing you to punish. Either you become \'human representative\' of the God or simply use the authority as \'head of nation\' to punish deviants. With time you realize the former raises questions as more people refuse to accept concept \'God\'s messenger\' for punishment. On the other hand the rhetoric of nation citing threats gives you credible central authority to impose the punishments. Slowly more people question various aspects of your stories- religion, nation. So you\'ve the task to decide which to let go of to retain trust of people. And here you realize- you can afford to dilute religion, but the nation is far more important (the power of religion is a part of the power of nation). By all means, you hold on to nation to avoid anarchy & effective implementation of regulations & incentives. Retaining the trust in nation often requires investments- invention of more threats, some actual threats (as relations deteriorate) but you\'re ready to walk the extra mile to ensure anarchy doesn\'t break loose within your territory.Where did race, caste come from? Inventing those \'ideologies\' for creating more nations required fomenting divisions. It started with tapping natural differences such as color/race, gender and moved on to artificial ones like castes.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now enter reality: Religious head though powerful has always been less powerful than the state which controlled economic means as well as legislation. It was always more acceptable to let go of the concepts of religion & other things since they\'re making it easier for the nation rhetoric (overuse of the same \'nation\' rhetoric will turn off people). So the governments go to great lengths to preserve & instill patriotism- championing history, culture and fostering unity through even sports. So it\'s not in the best interests of society to let go of patriotism and people in power therefore ensure it\'s "a widely celebrated form of identity affirmation".Should you question patriotism like other constructs? By all means, Yes. The problem is obviously in the assumption of the head of society who wants only societal progress. Reality is not so idealistic. But before questioning do remember the uses of these constructs and how they have evolved over time.Note: Some have an issue that I haven\'t addressed whether we should question these norms or not. The question asks for why things are as they are, and it\'s essential we understand social construction of these norms to understand status quo.'

S' I hate being preachy as once upon a time, I pissed off everyone with it. But since you raised the platform for discussion I thought the need to emphasize on an issue which even \'liberals\' have hard time practicing. [EDIT: If you\'re seeing it on your feed, this is the question description: "I feel the way I was brought up the first 17-18 years of my life was very conservative. By logic, I understand that things in India especially regarding women need to change. But I find it difficult to change my mindset. What can I do?"]Don\'t pass on the blame to the \'other\': The government is responsible for corruption, the rich & greedy for money-laundering, the media for unwanted sensationalism, the uneducated for committing all the rapes across the nation? When we pass on the blame to someone else for crimes happening in the society, we miss an opportunity to look within ourselves. But remember- whether it be the government or a random rapist on the street: they\'re all by-products of this society. Odds are if me or you were to be elected into the position of power, we\'d have done the same as the government official. Considering the society we live in- where violence is sometimes forbidden and otherwise glorified and women are seen as inferior; odds are me or you could be a rapist. Yes, it\'s true. Unless we tame the devil within ourselves. Unless we remove that part of the society from ourselves which let the criminal commit the crime- in this case, our inclination to violence and disrespect for women we could\'ve been him.(Image: We need teamwork as a society, not blame games)Changing mindset is a long task and one of the best ways to begin is- rather than pointing fingers, passing on the blame & denying our role in creating the monstrous society; take a moment to look within ourselves & purge that part of ourselves which has contributed to the crimes.'

S" Chetan Bhagat's success is not an exception, it's almost a part of the rule. We ask as if he's a rare person whose horrible work by standards of the art-form he practices has elevated him to success. Let's turn our heads elsewhere for a moment- Bollywood. The two most commercially successful actors are Akshay Kumar & Salman Khan. I can spend an entire lifetime trying to decipher some meaning in their movies, but won't be able to. Yet they are idolized 'stars'. Music? The infamous Honey Singh- after rape protests- who used to be darling of so many. Awful lyrics demeaning women alongside painful beats. Media? Times of India beats every other with their inclination to gossip. The literary equivalent of these trends is Chetan Bhagat. Moreover it's not exclusive to India. We have Stephenie Meyer (Twlight), Justin Bieber. The good news is- they're popular in their own times but fade away across generations- as we wouldn't advocate them to read CB or listen to Honey. Now let's analyze how does trash climb to success? In one word: populism. The common thread running across Salman's antics, Honey Singh's 'melody' or CB's books are tapping the consumer psyche & standing true to their aspirations. So when people see Akshay Kumar jumping off buildings unscathed & dancing with gorgeous ladies or Salman beating 50 policemen at a time- who wouldn't want that? Or giving the youth who confront sex as a taboo some celebration about it with some 'catchy' beats. Achyut & Rachana have done the ad-hoc analysis of how Chetan Bhagat exploits populism already- writing about sex, IITs, IIMs.However there's a twist in what separates Chetan Bhagat's success from Salman or Honey's. The difference is inherent to the field of literature vs. music/movies- people find going through 400 pages of dry-text much tougher than viewing pictures in motion. As a result, many youngsters never take up literature- but want to: seeing their friends create a mystery around it. Chetan Bhagat introduced an easy way for starters- dumbed down the language, reduced the price, stripped it of thought-provoking content to make reading accessible to masses. And so the youth without having to go through grinding thought processes of Joyce & Dostoyevsky were nevertheless involved in literature- they had found their messiah in Chetan Bhagat. He trended, became a youth icon- the readers found it cool. He addressed another youth aspiration-to be seen reading. The current bashing going on is part of social (de)construction of popularity- undoing cool factor to make it uncool being seen reading him ensuring his fame remains temporary.Also read: Why do some people dislike Indian writer Chetan Bhagat?"

S" China officially has a high literacy rate of 96.4% (CIA The World Factbook 2015).However this rate is misleadingly high, and illiteracy is actually quite common.As long as you pass a fourth-grade exam, you are considered literate, even if later you are no longer able to read or write (Illiteracy Jumps in China, Despite 50-Year Campaign to Eradicate It). You only need to know 950 Chinese characters you are considered literate, but as Victor Mair, Professor of, Chinese Language and Literature at UPenn notes,we know from pedagogical standards outside of China that this figure is woefully inadequate for functioning as a literate member of a society that uses Chinese characters for daily communication in a variety of fields, literature, news media, instructional manuals, high school and college textbooks, and so forth.(The cost of illiteracy in China)Pinyin.info looks at a 1996 study which actually tested a national probability sample, and a high estimate of the literacy rate was about 76% (as opposed to the official figures of 85%) (Chinese literacy). Once one weights this for population and the ability to write (which is, after all, half the definition of literacy) it is evident that the official literacy rate in China is misleadingly high.This being China, there is also concern that officials are inflating the figures. As it is with GDP growth, so it is for literacy statistics.China's poverty and large rural population surely have something to do with its illiteracy rate, but the written language definitely plays a part as well. It is instructive that many languages (e.g. Vietnamese, Korean) used to be written with Chinese characters, but transitioned to other scripts, partly to promote literacy (Vietnamese Writing System, History of Hangul Part I).It is also revealing that in China and Japan, young people are losing their ability to write Chinese characters without help (from their computers or phones) and thus are essentially illiterate (When Chinese children forget how to write - BBC News, Wired youth forget how to write in China and Japan). This suggests that Chinese characters are hard to connect with the spoken language, which impedes literacy.Sure, Chinese characters might be beautiful - but beauty doesn't aid either communication or literacy.For more on the difficulty of Chinese characters: Why Chinese Is So Damn Hard"

Once one weights this for population and the ability to write (which is, after all, half the definition of literacy) it is evident that the official literacy rate in China is misleadingly high.This being China, there is also concern that officials are inflating the figures. As it is with GDP growth, so it is for literacy statistics.'

S' Adapted from: Gabriel Seah\'s answer to Why are people so upset about the killing of Cecil the lion?There is no reason to be against hunting for sport as it is currently practised.Let us look at some typical objections to hunting.Conservation angles?Panthera leo, the African Lion, is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Panthera leo (African Lion, Lion)).That might sound worrying, but Gadus morhua (Atlantic Cod) is also Vulnerable (Gadus morhua (Atlantic Cod, Cod, Codling, Haberdine, Kil\'din Cod)) and most people have no problems with eating it. Ditto with lots of other species of seafood (10 Fish You\'re Eating That Are Endangered Species).The Giant Gippsland Earthworm - Endangered on the IUCN Red List (i.e. more endangered than the African lion) and the poster of child of no conservation campaignsFurthermore, hunting for sport can in many cases actually be *good* for threatened species.Hunters spend a lot of money, which stimulates local economies, and encourages locals to conserve wildlife so hunters can come and shoot animals.Indeed, the legalisation of white rhino hunting in South Africa was responsible for the population exploding from less than 100 to more than 11,000 (Can trophy hunting actually help conservation? - Conservation). Elephants in Zimbabwe have also benefited from hunting.Animal cruelty?The vast majority of those against hunting for sport happily eat meat, and factory farming is far more cruel (Farm Animal Cruelty) - it\'s just that you don\'t see or imagine it, so it\'s out of sight, out of mind.If it\'s alright for countless animals to suffer their entire lives just to give you some momentary pleasure from their meat, what is the suffering of a few animals to give a hunter his own pleasure?Hens in a cage. Battery hens live in these for an average of 18 months, almost 329 times as long as the 40 hours Cecil the lion took to dieUnsportsmanship-like behaviorThis is a somewhat more interesting objection.This objection to hunting goes along the lines of it being "unfair" for people armed with modern weaponry and other technology (and usually with support staff) to go up against animals only equipped with teeth and claws.And thus it is not a sport.One might question what fair play might involve.Should the hunter arm himself with a rifle without scopes and/or night vision devices?Should the hunter not camouflage himself?Should the hunter arm himself with a spear - no firearms?Should the hunter only use his bare hands?Yet, hunted animals are physically stronger, probably faster and definitely better equipped with natural weapons than humans.Just what should hunters do to give animals a sporting chance?Similarly, is it sporting for athletes from developed countries,- benefiting from nutrition and sport science- who can afford to train full-time- train at high altitudes to increase their red blood cell count- using the latest aerodynamic bodysuits (Under Armours secret Olympic mission: Build a faster speedskating suit) and- who have expensive personal trainers and coachesto go up against athletes from developing countries who- have day jobs- train barefoot on dirt tracks- are malnourished and- compete in simple jerseys?Really, all this fuss about hunters being unsporting is moot since we don\'t get upset when people are unsporting in other areas.Did Lance Armstrong get death threats for being unsporting and doping?Indeed, it seems to me that the only ones getting death threats in those instances were the ones who contributed to Armstrong\'s fall from grace (Is Lance Armstrongs Fate Really Worth Making Death Threats?). So people were upset at those seeking to maintain the purity of the sport (such as it is) more than Armstrong, who broke the rules.In other words, what upsets people isn\'t really that hunters are unsporting.And even if it were unsporting how would that make it "irresponsible"?Is anybody being hurt by killing for sport?'

S' Most anti-hunting sentiment is due to a combination of:- romanticisation of charismatic megafauna- thinly-disguised bashing of rich people- generalised online misanthropyThe reaction to the killing of Cecil the Lion is no exception, and is similar to past reactions when Ian Gibson was trampled to death by an elephant (Game Hunter Trampled To Death By Elephant), Rebecca Francis killed a giraffe (This woman smiled after shooting a giraffe, and the Internet is outraged) and Kendall Jones posted pictures of herself smiling beside dead African game (Uproar over cheerleaders trophy hunts posted on Facebook).Perhaps there was some slight increase in outrage due to the hunt being illegal and Cecil being famous, but really how many non-Zimbabweans had heard of Cecil before his killing, and why does legal hunting also upset people?Let us look at some of the reasons typically given to justify outrage at this kind of hunting and hunter: conservation, animal cruelty and sportsmanship.ConservationCecil was a member of the species Panthera leo, the African Lion, which is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Panthera leo (African Lion, Lion)).That might sound worrying, but Gadus morhua (Atlantic Cod) is also Vulnerable (Gadus morhua (Atlantic Cod, Cod, Codling, Haberdine, Kil\'din Cod)) and most people have no problems with eating it.

So people were upset at those seeking to maintain the purity of the sport (such as it is) more than Armstrong, who broke the rules.In other words, what upsets people isn\'t really that hunters are unsporting.Romanticisation of charismatic megafaunaRebecca Francis, who posed for a photo with a dead giraffe and got a barrage of death threats after Ricky Gervais condemned her (Huntress becomes \'the hunted\' after barrage of death threats over kill selfies), noted thatthe animals I have taken with a bow include: a 10 1/2 ft. brown bear, black bear, shiras moose, alaskan moose, dall sheep, stone sheep, desert bighorn ram, rocky mountain bighorn ram, mule deer, whitetail deer, elk, mountain goat, antelope, arapawa ram, kudu, zebra, black wildebeest, giraffe, springbuck, blesbuck, lynx, badger, and squirrel(Rebecca Francis giraffe photo causes storm - CNN.com)Yet, it seems that what got the most attention was the giraffe, which is telling.Gervais\'s tweet is also revealing:What must\'ve happened to you in your life to make you want to kill a beautiful animal & then lie next to it smiling?At least some of the hate, then, comes from the animal being "beautiful".Thinly-disguised bashing of rich peopleThe rich are one of the seemingly few groups that it is okay to hate nowadays, and it is clear from the subtext of many of the comments that this sentiment is present.One clear example is the journalist Piers Morgan who said that,I will sell tickets for $50,000 to anyone who wants to come with me and track down fat, greedy, selfish, murderous businessmen like Dr Palmer in their natural habit.(Piers:Id love to hunt with Walter Palmer so I can stuff and mount him)Nevermind that Palmer is not fat. Nor is he a businessman. And there doesn\'t seem to be any evidence that he is greedy, selfish or murderous (by definition you can\'t "murder" an animal).He is a hunter, so he must be a corporate fatcat!Similarly, the ban on fox hunting in England is at least as much about class as protecting foxes from cruelty (Fox hunts thrive in Britain, but class-tinged controversy won\'t go away).Generalised online misanthropyBy now if you\'re not living under a rock you must have heard about at least one Internet witch hunt.The glee expressed by many people as they fantasise about torturing Walter Palmer is really disturbing. For example:Truly. I\'d put a cross bow bolt through Walter Palmer then track him from 40 hrs, shoot him, behead him, skin him and sleep peacefully.(People Are Flooding This Dentist\'s Facebook After He Was Named As The Hunter Who Killed Cecil The Lion)Even if they don\'t want to kill him, they certainly want him ruined.Sharon Osbourne tweeted of her hope that he loses his home, his practice & his money (before noting: He has already lost his soul).(Who\'s Really Killing the Lions of Zimbabwe?)As a New York Times article observed,Perhaps she had now come to understand that her shaming wasnt really about her at all. Social media is so perfectly designed to manipulate our desire for approval, and that is what led to her undoing. Her tormentors were instantly congratulated as they took Sacco down, bit by bit, and so they continued to do so. Their motivation was much the same as Saccos own  a bid for the attention of strangers  as she milled about Heathrow, hoping to amuse people she couldnt see(How One Stupid Tweet Blew Up Justine Saccos Life)Basically, people are just looking for targets to bash and hate, especially in the Internet age where hating on people is something of a performance art.PostscriptTo some constituencies, Walter Palmer is a hero.By shooting Cecil the Lion he saved the lives of about 250 antelope Cecil would\'ve eaten over his life.Cecilia the Lion killing an antelopeAs well as any cubs Cecil would\'ve killed if he\'d taken over a pride (Why killing infants can benefit animals).Meanwhile, humans die all the time but this rarely attracts attention (People are upset over the reaction to the deaths of a human in Calais and a lion).Perhaps some "animal lovers" really just hate humans.'

In all, 28% of liberals have blocked, unfriended, or hidden someone on [Social Networking Sites] because of [political] reasons, compared with 16% of conservatives and 14% of moderates. "Basically liberals are more intolerant of differing political opinions than conservatives, who are slightly more intolerant than moderates.Traditionally social and political psychology research has found that liberals are more tolerant than conservatives, but recent research (The Ideological-Conflict Hypothesis) shows thatliberals and conservatives express similar levels of intolerance toward ideologically dissimilar and threatening groupsIn other words, intolerance is mediated (influenced) by difference in ideology and threat.The growing commitment to ideological purity and the demonization of political opponents (e.g. I\'m a liberal professor, and my liberal students terrify me), then, suggests that liberals nowadays are more intolerant than conservatives.'

S' Frequency data on this is hard to come by, but there have been studies on this.Yes, there\'re studies on everything.Scissoring aka tribadism aka dyking (slang) is reported to be a common lesbian sexual practice in Blumstein and Schwartz\'s 1983 classic: American Couples: Money, Work, Sex, though I am unable to find the original and see if any frequency data was reported.Jay and Young\'s The Gay Report (1979) reports that "tribadism... was also practiced frequently by a large majority of lesbian respondents [but] was the least popular of the three primary methods for having an orgasm in lesbian sexual experience".Munson\'s 1987 non-representative survey of "more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado" found that 80% had scissored in their last 10 sexual sessions.Martha Rosenthal in "Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society" (2012) reports that the most common lesbian sexual practice is manual stimulation, followed by oral sex and tribadism, but there\'re no sources provided so take this with a pinch of salt.So basically it seems that lesbians do scissor on a regular basis, but not as often as they touch each other\'s genitals and have oral sex.'

S' The short answer is that you can\'t really do that.News outlets are free to publish what they want and, at least in a free country, there\'s no easy way to force them to be entirely truthful (instead of peddling half-truths).If what they have published is technically true, as in the Gawker story, one would not be able to hit them for defamation (or libel, where the name depends on the jurisdiction). And in the Gawker story it\'s not entirely clear what sort of damages the family would be able to prove anyway.Probably the best way to mitigate the trend of misleading news articles (which feeds into the clickbait phenomenon which is ultimately driven by ad revenue [Taboola: The internet firm at the forefront of \'click-bait\' - BBC News]) is to employ critical news literacy. If a story sounds too "good" to be true, it probably is.And then, you can do several things:- Write in to the publication to complain. Make your voice heard as a reader. At the very least this will annoy them.- Post the truth in the comments section. Heartwarmingly, the 4th and 5th comments on the Gawker post highlight how misleading it is and present the critical information we need to fully evaluate this story.- Recommend/like/promote/upvote comments by others which highlight the truth.- Comment when friends share these stories (since these stories are made to be shared so as to get more views and thus ad revenue). This will improve their critical media literacy.This won\'t do a lot on its own, but if enough people do something at least the tide of ignorance will be countered (slightly). And if nothing else you will know you\'re doing something to fight it.'

S' Prostitution is institutionalised in Chinese culture and history, and socio-economic conditions in modern China make it an open secret.There is even a saying to describe (male) vices: "" (Eating, Drinking, Visiting Prostitutes, Gambling)Contrast this with the European version:Who does not love wine, women, and songRemains a fool his whole life long.The women here are, at the very least, not explicitly labelled as prostitutes.History of Prostitution in ChinaThere\'re various accounts of early prostitution in China but all seem to agree that it started as a state-sponsored enterprise, with government-run prostitution peaking during the Tang and Song dynasties. It seems prostitution was a part of life:During the golden eras of Chinese literary history (Tang and Song dynasties), almost every great poet or politician mentioned his visits to prostitutes without any shame. It is not an exaggeration to claim that prostitutes played a role in stimulating some of the best poems in Chinese history.(Source 2)Of the 49,000 poems in  (The Complete Poetry of the Tang), "over 4,000 are related to prostitutes and 136 were written by prostitutes themselves" (The World of Chinese).Marco Polo claimed that Peking had more than 20,000 prostitutes, and that there were so many in Hangzhou he could not give an estimate.State prostitution continued until the Qing dynasty, when the Shunzhi and Kangxi Emperors wound down the local and Imperial governments\' involvement in prostitution. However private prostitution continued. Prostitution was never legally sanctioned until the Republic of China was established in 1911.In 1920 Shanghai, theShanghai Municipal Council calculated that more than 70,000 prostitutes were in the foreign concessions... If these gures are approximately correct, then in the French Concession in 1920, where there were 39,210 female adults on the population registers, one in every three women was a whore (Sun Guoqun 1988:-4). Altogether, it was estimated at the time that Shanghai\'s ratio of one prostitute to every 157 inhabitants was the highest among major world cities; Tokyo\'s ratio being 1:277; Chicagos, 1:457; Pariss, 1:481; Berlins, 1:582; and Londons, 1:906 (Yang Jjiezeng and He Wannan 1988:1).(Source 3)In conclusion, there is a long history in China of official attitudes to prostitution ranging from tolerance to active state involvement.On the other hand, the People\'s Republic of China is intensely against prostitution, and cracked down on it soon after its establishment in 1949. As OP notes, it has not been successful.Factors contributing to modern prostitution (and its acceptance)On top of Chinese history, modern China also has many features which lead to prostitution being popular. Not all of these factors are explicitly linked to prostitution being open or acceptable, but I would argue that ubiquity tends to normalise an activity.Sexual Attitudes of Chinese WomenChinese women (like East Asian women in general [Source 6]) are sexually conservative, so Chinese men "resort to prostitution for their sexual demand"; where women are more free with their sexual favours, men are less likely to pay for them. For example, a 1992 survey found that 33% of men in the US who turned 20 in the 1950s had paid for sex, but thanks to the sexual revolution and women\'s lib, in the 1990s the rate dropped to as low as 5% (The University of Chicago Magazine: October 2002).Sexual RepressionChina is also a sexually repressed society. For instance, adultery got one a jail sentence until 1980 (Inside Chinas Mistress-Industrial Complex).There is also a concept of "" (Sexual Misconduct):Castration, on the other hand, was traditionally reserved specifically for sex crimes. The Great Commentary to the Exalted Documents (Shang-shu ta-chuan  attributed to Fu Sheng , fl. thirdsecond centuries B.C.), for example, states that castration (kung ) is the punishment for those men and women who have intercourse without morality . One of the oldest explanations of kung comes in the Comprehensive Discussions in the White Tiger Hall (Po-hu tung ), which explain that kung is the punishment for yin , i.e., licentiousness or promiscuity.   When a woman is licentious, she is to be seized and held inside a room, and not allowed to leave. When a man is licentious, his genitals are to be cut off(Source 5)(I find this bit puzzling given how open China historically was about prostitution - perhaps someone else can shed light on it)At one point premarital sex was officially grounds for expulsion at all Chinese universities (Chinese universities may alter tough sex rules) and at one sex between men and women was labelled prostitution (Guangdong college says all student sex is \'illegal prostitution\', threatens expulsion).An instructive comparison can be made with another, nearby East Asian country - Japan. Japan is a highly repressed society, and it is theorised that the popularity, ubiquity and outlandishness (or perversion, if you prefer) of Japanese pornography (JAV) stems from this repression.Materialism and Income InequalityThe materialism and income inequality of modern China also contribute to prostitution\'s popularity.The phenomenon of materialism is much discussed, and was neatly epitomised in a (female) contestant on China\'s most popular dating show proclaiming that "I\'d rather cry in a BMW car than laugh on the backseat of a bicycle" (Page on time.com).Meanwhile inequality meanss that, especially for rural women in the cities, prostitution is a rational choice:The postsocialist trafc in women has given unprecedented commercial value to the nubile bodies of rural women who come to the city seeking work. As many of them quickly learn, it is hardly worth it to take a respectable but low-paying job as a maid when the likelihood of rape by an employer is so high. One young bar hostess put it this way: Dalian men try to cheat both our bodies and emotions. Without spending a cent, they get what they want from us. The only way to avoid being tricked, used, and abandoned, said another, is to protect yourself by making sure you get enough money for the sex you sell to men (Zheng 2009:220)... bar hostesses in the post-Mao era present themselves primarily as lial daughters serving their parents. They see doing sex work as a rational choice: it earns the highest return on the capital they have to invest (Zheng 2009:147-171).(Source 4)A close parallel to the openness of prostitution in China is its mistress culture, which is similarly widespread and open (Inside Chinas Mistress-Industrial Complex), and whose concurrent popularity (and openess) spring from similar reasons.One Child PolicyThe one child policy has led to a shortage of women in China and By 2030, projections suggest that more than 25% of Chinese men in their late 30s will never have married(Why Chinese men are the most single in the world: the perils of gender imbalance in China)Naturally, if there are many men who cannot find wives, the demand for prostitution will go up.Even a Chinese official who advises the state on population issues has noted that an uptick in prostitution is an inevitable consequence of the One Child Policy (40m bachelors and no women ... the birth of a new problem for China).CorruptionCorruption is widespread in China, and it is easy to bribe officials to turn a blind eye (Prostitution is Key to Reducing Corruption in China). Some are even actively paid by the sex industry.Indeed, sex is part of the currency of corruption in China, with officials being "paid" with sex (Double standards on prostitution enrages blogosphere | Asia | DW.DE | 20.02.2014).With such vested interests by many levels of government (and the promise of a quick buck by closing two eyes), it\'s no wonder prostitution persists.(Long Format) Sources:1) Sex in China: Studies in Sexology in Chinese Culture / Fang Fu Ruan2) China\'s Policies toward Illegal Drugs and Prostitution in the New Era: Struggle within the Global Context / Bin Liang, Liqun Cao in Modern Chinese Legal Reform: New Perspectives / ed Xiaobing Li, Qiang Fang3) Licensing Leisure: The Chinese Nationalists\' Attempt to Regulate Shanghai, 1927-49 / Frederic Wakeman, Jr. 4) Gender and Sexuality in Modern Chinese History / Susan L.

S" There're 2 ways to look at this question: story logic and symbolism.Story LogicWithin the logic of the movie The Wolverine, the amputation of Wolverine's claws seems to be necessary for The Silver Samurai aka Yashida to extract Logan's healing factor.After Wolverine's claws are amputated, tiny drills extend from The Silver Samurai's suit and pierce his stumps, and the healing factor is extracted from him.Notably the tiny drills did not penetrate his skin - which would be easier to breach, being softer and more accessible than his stumps; just imagine how easy it would have been if Yashida had just needed to poke Wolverine anywhere (perhaps in the butt) and suck his healing factor.Perhaps the healing factor resided in his bones and accessing them through his claw stumps was the easiest way to penetrate his bones, since Yashida wouldn't have needed to work his way through flesh before hitting the bone. As we know, Wolverine's skeleton is coated with adamantium: the adamantium coating around his bone claws might also be thinner than that around the rest of his skeleton.Of course, Wolverine's declawing also made it easier for Yashida to extract the healing factor from Logan - since he had lost his main weapon.SymbolismWolverine's losing his claws is very interesting and potent imagery as he is strongly identified with his adamantium claws. It is interesting that he regenerates his bone claws - which he hasn't seen/used for almost 4 decades - and uses them to finish Yashida off.The loss of the adamantium claws (which have been on him from 1979 to 2013 [according to Timeline]), his near death at Yashida's hands and his Triumph the return of his bone ones can be seen as representing:Castration - he has lost the symbol of his Potency and his main Weapon/ToolThe Symbol of the Woman - Loner that he is, Wolverine has had many tragic relationships with women. First Kayla Silverfox, then Jean Grey and now Mariko. Yet he paradoxically finds strength in these women - and here it is the Woman who comes to save him from an enemy he cannot best.Rebirth - shorn of his adamantium claws, he is reborn as the old LoganExorcism - with the loss of his claws, he says goodbye to a part of his past and his old demons - he can now move on. Recall that after this he has a vision where he finally lets go of Jean Grey (when previously in the movie he has been haunted by her memory). I wouldn't go so far as to call this Redemption, though.Logan has lost something - but at the same time he has also (re)gained something - a part of himself that he has lost."

S' The draft isn\'t totally ended in the US - under the Selective Service System, male US residents between 18 and 25 (Registration - How the U.S. Draft Works) are required to register.Legally if you don\'t register you can be jailed and fined but in reality you lose a lot of government benefits.That said, the nature of activism is that one is always focused on what is wrong or problematic, rather than what has been done.For example, the UK has been rated the best place in Europe to be gay (UK is \'best place in Europe\' to be gay), and Europe in turn is surely the best continent to be gay. Yet, in the same breath, Stonewall (a LGBT "professional lobbying group") adds that "We must not underestimate how much work there is yet to do".This can also be seen in feminism, the mirror image of men\'s rights activism. After all the victories of feminism, in the developed world it is now essentially about First World Problems. Yet, you wouldn\'t know this from seeing how upset feminists get about women\'s issues. As Hanna Rosin observes, The closer women get to real power, the more they cling to the idea that they are powerless. To rejoice about feminist victories these days counts as betrayal.(Feminists, Accept It. The Patriarchy Is Dead.)Activists are reluctant to acknowledge that things are good because they lose their raison d\'tre, funding, political capital, the power of victimhood (Psychology of Victimhood, Don\'t Blame the Victim, Article by Ofer Zur, Ph.D.) and/or a sense of righteousness, which can be intoxicating.That said, from what I\'ve seen of MRAs they don\'t seem to be saying that despite the effective end of the draft things are going from bad to worse, but that the draft aside things aren\'t very good (and are possibly getting worse).'

S' It depends.As Scott Lowe points out, delisting a site is the main sanction UNESCO can visit upon a country (with the attendant negative publicity and loss of prestige, tourism money and restoration assistance).UNESCO has, of the writing of this post, delisted only 2 World Heritage Sites:Dresden Elbe ValleyArabian Oryx SanctuaryDresden was struck off the list due to the building of the Waldschlsschen Bridge, which "meant that the property failed to keep its "outstanding universal value as inscribed"" (Dresden is deleted from UNESCOs World Heritage List).Meanwhile, the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was deleted from the list because Oman reduced its size by 90% (Oman\'s Arabian Oryx Sanctuary : first site ever to be deleted from UNESCO\'s World Heritage List).Basically, UNESCO World Heritage sites should not be substantially affected, such that the criteria under which they were inscribed are affected. It is quite shameful for a site to be delisted, and the idea is to deter sites from being substantially affected by development (or some other human intervention) so UNESCO gives warnings before delisting a site.The removal of the murals looks to be at least partly a political issue as they first came up during the 2011-2014 term of the previous mayor Susana Villaran (a rival to the current one Luis Castaneda) (Lima\'s mayor confesses to cover-up of downtown murals).UNESCO does not seem to have condemned the murals or threatened Lima with being removed from the list and has even said they do not interfere (unless there is "imminent risk" to cultural heritage; Lima murals: Not part of mission of Unesco to inferfere).In my evaluation, it is doubtful that if there were many murals, the character of the Historic Centre of Lima might be affected unless the murals, say, covered the facades of historic buildings like the Torre Tagle palace (which I find very unlikely).'

S' Pornography is one way people let off sexual tension (no, not just in that way - get your mind out of the gutter!)Looking at American porn, we can observe that some subgenres like housewives getting it on with plumbers, electricians or pizza delivery men could represent an eroticisation of male insecurities. Just what is the missus getting up to when she\'s alone at home?This is similar to cuckolding scenarios (where someone other than a woman\'s partner or husband seduces her and has sex with her).Black men are seen as sex objects in Japan. There was even a phenomenon in the early 1990s about "yellow cabs" which capitalizedon the Japanese popular obsession with the specter of Japanese women copulating with foreign men, black men in particular. The male-dominated Japanese media took [Shoko] Ieda\'s bait, and in articles in low-brow men\'s weekly magazines quickly elevated the yellow cab phenomenon to scandal of the year, salaciously excoriating the women as sexually insatiable sluts in thrall to the black phallus - a threat, to say the least, to Japapn\'s racial and national purity- Women on the Verge: Japanese Women, Western Dreams / Karen KelskySome of this sexualisation of black men has been imported from American culture (The Blasian Narrative: The Status of Black People in Japan: Part VII - The Effect of anti-Black Stereotypes and Western Privileging on the Japanese construction of Blackness), but Japan has also nurtured it:The stereotypical imaages of black men in [Amy] Yamada\'s narratives resemble her depictions of women; as lusty, volatile, physical beings held captive by overpowering appetites and marginalized by dominant (Japanese and white male) economic power... A struggle then ensures, between the similar and disparate natures of black male / Japanese female - a struggle fought along the same axis of dominance/submission- Power and Gender in the Narratives of Yamada Eimi / Nina CornyetzThere is probably also some element of transgression of Japanese racial purity too, with black men being obviously non-Japanese and thus effectively Othered - if even zainichi* are not seen as Japanese by many Japanese, what more blacks?* - ethnic Koreans living in Japan, many of whom face discrimination as non-Japanese even if they were born thereAn alternative explanation is that these scenarios represent a projection of latent desires: Japanese men fantasise about getting it on like black men are seen as doing, and want to become as sexual(ised).'

S' Neither. This is a category error.At least according to Abrahamic mythology, angels are generally spiritual beings with no gender (an earthly concept)."Jesus says of the angels that they do not marry (Matthew 22:30) and it is the standard Christian view that they are pure spirits without bodies (Hebrews 1:14, compare with Luke 24:39). This would seem to imply that angels are neither male nor female."- Angels: A Very Short Introduction / David Albert Jones"Because angels are spirits, they have no sex and real angels are neither male nor female"- Angels in the Bible / Elaine Murray Stone, Cathy Rayburn"Angels have no bodies, therefore no biological gender"- Angels and Demons: What Do We Really Know about Them? / Peter KreeftIn Christian art, angels have been portrayed as both male and female, depending on the context, but this is how they are perceived/reveal themselves, rather than revealing their "true gender" (so to speak).Judaism seems to be a bit more complicated, with angels being seen as androgynous in some thought systems and as male-female pairs (syzygies) in others (The Kabbalistic Teachings of Jesus in the Gospel of Thomas / Lewis Keizer).Similarly, God is neither male nor female, as these are earthly concepts that do not apply to the realm of the divine.'

S' A basic definition of religion would be to follow Edward Burnett Tylor:Religion is a belief in spiritual beings.In this case, feminism is not a religion since it does not talk about the spirit world.Nonetheless, it has many characteristics of a religion, and specifically a religion in the Judeo-Christian tradition, among which are:- The concept of (Original) Sin surfaces as that of Male Privilege, which is something that can never be fully cleansed and for which one must feel guilty (John Scalzi, "white male privilege", and original sin)- It has a bogeyman that is blamed for everything that is wrong in this world. Instead of Satan/The Devil, it is "patriarchy"- It has an assumption of infallibility and a refusal to question its basic assumption - that of "patriarchy"- There is fierce internecine dissent among its adherents about what seems (to outsiders) to be relatively minor ideological (theological) points, and condemnations of those who have sinned and fallen short (Theres no point in online feminism if its an exclusive, Mean Girls club)- Feminists condemn others as "not real feminists" or otherwise contest other people\'s adoption of the feminist label - this is like claims that specific Muslims aren\'t "true Muslims" or the chiding of "Sunday Christians"- There is an eschatological promise: of a Utopia when Patriarchy is finally dismantled and the feminist paradise arrives- There is a perpetual fallacy of pointing to what feminism is in theory rather that what it is in practice.

Yet, when they are sad they also cry.)Crying releases energy and feelings, and might even release stress hormones; it can also get you sympathy and support from others. Furthermore, women cry more than men, especially those "who report anxiety, as well as those who are extroverted and empathetic" (Why We Cry: The Truth About Tearing Up).Not coincidentally, anxiety is what is felt when anticipating the results of a beauty contest (or nationwide examinations, as in my previous example), and beauty pageant contestants would be more extroverted and empathetic than the general population.'

S' The Communist Party of China hasn\'t always whined (a curious term - I would say whipping up hatred is more accurate) about Japan.No less a figure than Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Communist Party of China and the founding father of the People\'s Republic of China, half-jokingly half-thanked Japan for invading China during World War II:When Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka visited Beijing in 1972 to restore Japan\'s relations with China, a country that had been devastated by Japanese military aggression in the 1930s and \'40s, his host Mao Zedong allowed himself a moment of levity. Responding to Tanaka\'s apology for what Japan had done during the war, Mao answered that there was absolutely no need to apologize. After all, he said, without the Japanese invasion, the Communist revolution would never have succeeded.Secure in his nationalist credentials, as the leader who unified China, Mao could afford this little joke, which also happened to be the truth.(A Dangerous Rift Between China and Japan)Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai warmly welcoming Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka(Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou Meet with Japanese PM Kakuei Tanaka -- china.org.cn)In 1978, Deng Xiaoping, the father of modern Communist-in-name-only China, visited Japan and happily shook the hand of the Prime Minister, Takeo Fukuda.Deng Xiaoping and Takeo FukudaIndeed, the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty read:China is striving to build itself into a modernized socialist power. We need a peaceful international environment and we are willing to develop friendly and cooperative ties with all countries. Despite different social systems in China and Japan, the two countries should and can coexist in peace and friendship(http://www.china.org.cn/english/...)To know why the Communist Party of China has so much antagonism against Japan today, it is illuminating to see when its attitude towards Japan changed.Basically the year that marks the watershed is 1989. Not coincidentally, 1989 was the year of the Tiananmen protests in China. With the Party abandoning its Communist ideology, the unifying national ideology was to be "patriotism", i.e. stirring up historic grievances against other countries to unify the People under the banner of the Party:The party blamed Tiananmen on dangerous foreign ideas and the mission of public history became to demonstrate that foreigners had been behind the countrys major setbacks since the early 19th century. The people were to be persuaded that the party was all that stood between China and foreigners ill-intentions and that Chinas long history and superior culture made it an exception to the widely observed phenomenon that, once they achieve a certain standard of living, people tend to demand a say in how they are governed.(China: at war with its history)It is also instructive to see how the Communist Party manages anti-Japan protests today: it actively encourages and suppresses them, according to the vagaries of domestic politics (internecine party politics also play a part here):The protests come when the leaders need one to come, and the protests will stop when they want them to stop...Mistaken for protesters, two journalists passing by were met by plainclothes police officers and instructed on where to go to more effectively protest.(Beijing both encourages and reins in anti-Japan protests, analysts say)Such cynical manipulation of anti-Japanese sentiment gives the lie to the simplistic claim that Japanese atrocities during the war are the primary reason for the Communist Party of China\'s stoking of anti-Japanese sentiments among the Chinese people.Two of the millions of victims of the famine caused by the "Great Leap Forward" - initiated by Mao Zedong[Ed: The previous image might not have been from the Great Leap Forward as it showed a ponytailed man - though I note that there\'re academic sources which show long-haired victims:The current image from The Laogai Research Foundation via Radio Free AsiaFor reference here is the previous image:)'

S" Other answers have touched on some of the reasons:- The cost of an army- There being no army to begin with- The army doing other things (e.g. guarding the frontier, protecting the realm from invasion, being tied up in wars etc)- Adventurers being trained specialists who move faster and more stealthily- Efficiency: you don't get half your army killed since they are cannon fodder (or arrow/trap fodder, as the case might be)- This being story/game logicHowever, I would suggest a more profound reason: incentivized competition.In the real world, take the example of the Ansari XPRIZE for Suborbital Spaceflight, the first competition organised by the X Prize Foundation.This awarded US$10 million to teams which successfully built private spaceships which could carry three people and fly twice in two weeks.Sure, the X Prize Foundation gave out US$10 million. However, 26 teams invested more than US$100 million in R&D (Ansari Team Results).

Most of whom will die if they're not successful and thus will never come back to trouble you, either by demanding compensation or starting bar fights.The risk to the Kings and Village Leaders is minimal, as it is capped at the cost of the reward (which can only go to one party, fraud notwithstanding [this is why you must bring back the Dragon's Head, or something tangible and non-rival - i.e. which other teams cannot possess simultaneously]).The Leader of a successful party of adventurers in the Real World"

S' The Importance of GradesGrades are really important in Singapore.You need good grades to get into the school that you want, to get a scholarship to study abroad and to get into the university and course of study of your choice.On top of it, many employers look at your grades and course of study when hiring (even for jobs unrelated to the field of study - Engineering for example is a desired degree even for non-engineering jobs). "Good honours" is a common line in job ads (while tuition at the university level is rare, tuition at lower levels gives you a boost which helps you get into the course of your choice, and arguably bolsters your foundations so you can do well later). And if you apply for a Government job, you will be asked to list your O and A level results (exams that one typically takes at the tender ages of 16 and 18 respectively).Let us not underestimate the role that parental bragging plays. Parents love to compare their children\'s grades, schools and courses of study, and they want their children to be doing better than Auntie Lee\'s (i.e. their friend\'s or relative\'s kids).All this is partly due to the Confucian paradigm, which is shared by other countries with East Asian populations (Singapore has ethnic Chinese as 75% of the population, so it counts). So South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China have tuition cultures too ().You don\'t have to be good...Perhaps the key here is that grades are all bell-curved (presumably to prevent grade inflation, and/or to segregate cohorts regardless of overall cohort quality), so for example only 20% of a cohort can get an A. In other words, even if you get 99/100 on an exam, if everyone else gets 100/100, you won\'t get an A. Education is a positional good, in the form of grades.Singaporeans spend so much money on tuition, then, because you don\'t have to be good - just better than everyone else. So it\'s an eternal arms race where you\'re forever trying to do better than the rest. This is Keeping up with the Joneses - for Singaporean children.Positive FeedbackThe pervasiveness of tuition has created a positive feedback loop. Whereas previously tuition was more common in the better schools, it now seems students everywhere go for it. So we now have teachers outsourcing work to tuition teachers or agencies.One case was reported by the Straits Times, the National Daily (The Straits Times Blogs):barely two weeks after the boy entered Primary One, Miss L received a phone call from his Chinese teacher.Of the 30 students in her class, the teacher said, 28 already knew Hanyu Pinyin (the romanisation system for Mandarin), even though she was only supposed to be teaching it in the months ahead. Miss L\'s son was one of the two that didn\'t.The teacher said she couldn\'t hold 28 kids back for the sake of two.Miss L promptly bundled her son off to an intensive Hanyu Pinyin class that cramped 6 months\' worth of curriculum into 8 sessions.The best part, my old classmates and I learnt, was that this took place not in an elite school, but in a neighbourhood school, somewhere in Tampines.For context, students in Primary One are aged 7 years old. So in the year of their entry into formal schooling, 93% of a class in a neighbourhood school (a colloquial term for not-so-good schools) were going for Mandarin tuition.This outsourcing of work to tuition agencies is also because of the "Teach Less, Learn More" policy (meant to reduce pressure on students, reduce rote learning and explore more innovative ways of learning). As one teacher comments,\'Teach Less Learn More\' but do it in less time and yet get students to ace national examinations - that becomes a real challenge for many educators.(National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore)Unsurprisingly, one easy way to do this is to let private tutors do the job.Root Causes?One might ask why this phenomenon of tuition has gotten worse.I went through the formal education school in the 90s, and things weren\'t quite as bad. Yet it seems nowadays everyone goes for tuition, and you see private education/tuition agencies everywhere nowadays (in the past it tended to take the form of one-to-one tutoring).I would finger two factors: immigration and harder exams.ImmigrationIn recent years we have had more and more immigration in Singapore. Yes, almost everyone complains about immigration nowadays, but it is plausible that it has effects even on the young.Immigration is not just limited to the working population. Students from all over Asia now study in Singaporean schools - not just the good schools but also the not-so-good ones.Foreign students are mostly very hard-working. After all they have come from a foreign country (and since they come from Asia, many are from poor backgrounds) and so make the most of their chances and study really hard. Since they typically have no family in Singapore and don\'t have many friends, they spend a lot of time studying. Because their parents are not here (and their parents wouldn\'t have the Singaporean kiasu [i.e. fear of losing out] mentality anyway) they also don\'t go for piano, speech and drama or what-have-you classes and thus have more time to study.Since we have the bell curve in effect, local students must thus work harder to keep up. In other words, they have to run faster to stay in the same place (i.e. the Red Queen hypothesis).Let\'s look at some numbers.In 2012, there were 51,000 foreign students in government-run schools and institutions, including the polytechnics and universities (Foreign student numbers drop sharply after climbing steadily). In 2013, there were 473,375 students in Primary, Secondary and Mixed Level schools and Junior College/Centralised Institute (Page on moe.gov.sg), 26,288 students in the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), 3,290 in Lasalle and NAFA, 79,970 in the Polytechnics and 59,748 in the Universities.So about 8% of students in government-run schools and institutions were foreign students. While not that high, this is significant enough to impact the dynamics of the education system, not least due to the trickle down effect (for example a student who might have gotten an A without foreign students now gets a B, one who might have gotten a B now gets a C and so on).Harder ExamsSchool in Singapore has become harder over the years.In the past, parents used to help their children with their schoolwork at the primary level, but now primary school students must answer exam questions that stump most adults (Parents complaining about difficult PSLE maths paper, WOW PSLE MATHS QUESTION SO HARD).Naturally, parents who are unable to help (i.e. most of them) pass the job over to tuition.Ironically, this is probably partly due to the "Teach Less, Learn More" and similar policies. Whereas in the past there was an emphasis on rote learning, the reduced emphasis on it means now other ways must be found of assessing students.Normally this would lead to less stress, but because students (and parents) want to ace the modified exams, they go to private education to learn techniques to ace them that don\'t just rely on memorisation.A Way Out?This is the bit where I say something clever and/or optimistic to make you feel good.Unfortunately, the problem is so entrenched that I can\'t see a way out.Even our eminent Ministers don\'t see a way out, with former Education Minister Ng Eng Hen proclaiming that "We\'re not as bad as the Koreans" and "It\'s innate in our Asian culture" (Tuition culture here not as bad as elsewhere, Hansard: Page on parl.gov.sg), in response to concerns about tuition culture.So between the system existing as it is, Confucian culture, kiasuism and a national ideology of meritocracy (where school grades are seen as a measure of merit and worth, and are currency that entitles one to a good life), there isn\'t any way out except to not have children, to have children overseas or to have children but be contented that they may not be the human resources that Singapore wants them to be (in other words, they may fail at the socially-important metrics like grades in school, but you can look at broader measures of success).'

Ruminants (cows, sheep, goats and deer (i.e. animals that can graze)) don\'t kill as many animals as digging up a field, planting crops, applying pesticides, harvesting etc.Source: The Least Harm Principle may require that humans consume a diet containing large herbivores, not a vegan diet'

S' Yes.A Norwegian study found that couples who share the housework are more likely to divorce than those with an unequal division of the chores (Couples who share the housework are more likely to divorce, study finds - Telegraph).The researchers suggest that this is partly because where there clear gender roles, there is less dispute between a couple. Feminists, then, with their insistence on eliminating gender roles, would have more contention in their relationships about gender roles and whether the split of responsibilities is gendered.Furthermore, the more modern a couple, the less sacred they view marriage. Feminism, which has a skeptical attitude to marriage and sometimes views it as an institution which oppresses women, would mean that feminist women are less favorable to marriage than non-feminist women.Other factors which lead to divorce are "marrying at a very early age, less education and income, living together before marriage, a premarital pregnancy, no religious affiliation, coming from a divorced family, and feelings of insecurity" (Page on usu.edu).

S" Women are indeed less interested in philosophy than men.There is a well-documented gender gap in Philosophy faculty and graduate programs, and this is also evident in undergraduate enrollment (Page on socphilpsych.org), with fewer and fewer women as depth of involvement increases - from introductory Philosophy courses to representation of the faculty. The largest drop is between introductory Philosophy courses and Philosophy majors. Notably, out of all the humanities, women are most under-represented in Philosophy.When interviewed (Georgia State tries new approach to attract more female students to philosophy @insidehighered), female Philosophy students reported that,Women generally found the course less enjoyable, and the material less interesting and relevant to their lives, than their male counterpartsThey also had more personal reasons like being unable to identify with coursemates and instructors, but this is irrelevant where this question is concerned.It could be that women don't like philosophy because philosophy is largely based on principles, whereas women are more relational in their reasoning.Carol Gilligan criticises Kohlberg's stages of moral development (Page on barnard.edu) which puts principled moral reasoning as the apex of moral development, since women are more relational in morality. Indeed, feminist philosophy emphasises the ethics of care over traditional conceptions of morality (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy).Ethics (the study of morality) is a major part of philosophy so given that women are more relational in their morality than men, it would stand to reason that they would be less able to relate to philosophy and so be less interested in it.Beyond that, Simon Baron-Cohen (The Essential Difference front page) has found that,the female brain is predominantly hard-wired for empathy, and that the male brain is predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systemsPhilosophy like physics (another field where women are underrepresented) is a systemic discipline which works on universal principles, which could explain why women are less interested in it."

S' If you go out with your eyes closed, no matter how bright the sun shines, you would still see darkness. For Parshuram\'s case, his divine eyes were obfuscated by anger.Lord Parshuram had earlier given Shiva\'s bow to king Janak and had instructed him to keep it safe. When Lord Ram broke it, Parshuram was immediately filled with anger and came to the king\'s palace to punish the "culprit". But when Lord Ram paid him obeisance and calmly requested him to give appropriate punishment, his anger subsided and he recognized the other divine.So never let yourself be blinded by anger - as it can cause you more harm than to others.'

S' When a woman fasts to protect her husband on Karva Chauth, people go crazy with the question, "Why should only women fast? Why not men? Isn\'t this patriarchal mindset?"And now when a brother is promising to protect his sister from adversity on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, you are raising the question, "Doesn\'t this intent to indicate women are weaker and men are stronger? Isn\'t this patriarchal mindset?"It has become a fashion today, arising from lack of understanding of the Indian culture, to associate every cultural element to some social evil and then blame them for promoting such practices. Each festival is now being mutated to propagate personal agendas. It seems that the flexibility offered by the religion, which is its one of the biggest strengths, is hurting itself big time, thanks to all the misinformed and hypocritical society.Raksha Bandhan celebrates the bond, love and friendship between siblings; the sister prays for the well being of her brother while the brother promises to protect her under all circumstances. It highlights the family ties, its closeness and the sanskaras that comes from the wisdom of our ancient sages. And this wisdom was always directed towards promoting harmony, quality, brotherhood and love in the society.So no, Raksha Bandhan does not promotes patriarchal society. It is all about love, and it takes love to understand its significance.'

S" In Hinduism, importance is given to one's action, karma, dharma and it's impact rather than on one's identity. The Trinity - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are considered to be superior than the Devas like Indra, because the former have much bigger roles. In Shaktism, Shakti is considered to be superior than the Trinity because she is the energy of all. Thus, these hierarchies are formed due to their responsibilities and actions - dharma and karma.For Rukhmini's case, our mythology has only talked about her identity - she being incarnation of Laxmi, it has never highlighted any of her achievements - and for a reason - unlike the births of Sita and Ram whose objectives, besides establishing dharma, were to set examples of ideal wife, husband, mother, ruler and so on, Krishna's role was to set examples of ideal lover, devotee, friend, guide, guru and to give mankind the lotus-like words of Gita, and Ruhkmini's role was to be his human-consort. One has to understand that this does not imply that she was inferior - it's just that they incarnated for some specific reasons.Now to set an example of an ideal lover and a devotee, one needs other side of the coin too, and here comes Radha, an epitome of selfless love, the love which knew no boundaries, no age, no community. It is this devotion which pulled Krishna to play his beautiful flute, and it is the same devotion which drove Radha to the Raas Leela, forgetting her own self. This love, this devotion, this karma, pure as a prayer, a silent meditation, is what makes Radha divine, this is what turns a devotee into God. Radha-Krishna have been a part of poetry, drama and folklore since time immemorial.So the world worships Radha to celebrate the bond of love and devotion, one of the paths to realize the Truth mentioned in the Gita. Laxmi's incarnation as Rukhmani was supposed to be a silent supporter - very important but less conspicuous. And this was by their own design, their own strategy, their masterplan."

It evolves according to the needs of the hour, discarding the old and replacing it with new - just as you replace your clothes with new design, fashion and age. But there is certain aspect of life, far away from the grasp of our hands and eyes, beyond the logical intellect, which is eternal, which specifies how to use the new knowledge, what purpose it should have, how inner self needs to be kept pure in the wake of unintentional consequences and so on. This knowledge contains the fundamental laws of life, the underlying principles needed to sustain the humanity as it should be - loving, progressing and happy. It is this piece of knowledge which Gita contains.So Gita does not have all human knowledge, but it has that part of knowledge, which is the essence, the foundation, the base from which all other types of knowledge derive their benefits, meaning and purposes."

It\'s looking for you, and it will find you if you want it to.- The MatrixIt was a doubt, a question that lead Neo to Morpheus, Amerigo Vespucci to America and JJ Thompson to the electron, and its the same doubt that drives many sages to the Himalayas.There is a very famous saying, "Stay hungry, stay foolish". This reflects the core of any discovery, great or small. It talks about the attitude needed to progress forward - one has to be eager enough to receive new experiences, and a doubt, a question is what that acts as a trigger to the fire of eagerness.But doubt alone cannot lead to ultimate truth. Having a doubt is like having a car - just having it would not take you to the destination; you have to fill-in the fuel, take it to services, and actually drive it. Realization of truth is a journey, a journey which involves various failures, injuries, sometimes you would need to sleep on the ground, with empty stomach, you have to ignore what people think of you and so on. For this, you need energy, dedication and hard-work.Buddha was terribly influenced seeing all the people suffering around him. Questions and doubts like, "Why is there so much suffering", "What is the purpose of life", etc haunted him. But if he had just gone back to his kingdom, would we be talking about a mortal attaining immortality sitting under a banyan tree in the middle of nowhere in India?Doubt is just like a seed - if given proper nourishment, it can grow into a lavish tree with splendid fruits, but if ignored, it just becomes another grain in the sands of time. So it is the combination of doubt and conscious efforts that can lead to the ultimate truth.'

They constantly honk unnecessarily while driving even when it is a red light or they are near a school or a hospital, and don\'t provide earmuffs to their employees while they are working everyday near noisy machines. The issue doesn\'t end here. These people would spend 1000s of dollars to see 4th of July fireworks in the US, or similar things at other events and places.But suddenly the eco-friendly person in them wakes up by the name of Diwali. Diwali becomes the one-step solution to all the environmental problems. People conveniently pass all their anti-environmental misdeeds to it thinking that they would become free from all the blame. It\'s like doing continuous sins hoping that a bath in Ganga would wash all these away, or actively participating in everyday corruption and transferring all the blame to the government citing various scams.My problem is not by "don\'t burn crackers" slogans but by these people and the fact that the eco-friendly person in them rises for just one day and then becomes dormant. I am a firm believer in the policies "be the change", "start small" and so on, but when these happen just for the cultural festivals and celebrations, then it feels as if someone is constantly shouting "Don\'t eat, don\'t eat!" for every bite I take of my favorite food. This is same as people suddenly realizing that India is suffering from poverty and saying, "That money could have been used to reduce poverty instead of wasting on the Mars mission Mangalyaan"."Green Diwali" means eco-friendly Diwali, not firecrackers-less Diwali. The good thing about Hinduism is that it has the flexibility to evolve with time. Burning traditional firecrackers might have been good a decade ago, but in today\'s world, they are a major nuisances. So the need of the hour is to learn from the West and evolve Diwali to use green firecrackers.So just don\'t blame others when you see them celebrating Diwali. Educate them about these new firecrackers and innovate to manufacture these at large scale and low cost. Evolve your consciousness so that you take care of environment in your day-to-day life.

S' It is discrimination, but not in terms of nationals and foreigners, but purely in terms of economics. This policy closely resembles the Third Degree Price Discrimination which is defined as follows:In third degree price discrimination, price varies by attributes such as location or by customer segment, or in the most extreme case, by the individual customer\'s identity; where the attribute in question is used as a proxy for ability/willingness to pay. - Price discriminationBefore you think that this is an extreme measure by the government, realize that this "discrimination" happens everyday around you without your conscious notice. Airlines frequently use these policies to charge differently for different classes (Economic, Business and First), time and types of seats depending on the leg room. Even the platinum and gold classes in movie theaters like PVR are created on the same principal.The difference between the above examples and the Taj ticket is that in movies and airlines, you willingly pay - depending upon the luxuries you want, status and so on, but to visit the world\'s marvel Taj Mahal, the prices are forced upon the visitors. But this is fine - the fact that foreigners have flown to India indicates their ability to pay, and if we convert this to international currencies like dollar or pounds, then it is cheaper than a meal.Discrimination in terms of nationalities is when you go to security at international airports and you are singled out for manual frisking. The Taj pricing is purely economic in nature and well thought of.'

S' Ever wondered why diamond shines so brilliantly? It shines after it has been cut by friction. Similarly gold cannot be purified without fire. People cannot become successful just by reading motivational books or attending lectures and seminars. They have to experiment, fail, experiment harder, fail harder and go through this cycle again and again. They have to walk miles on foot to save a penny, bear all the criticism and tantrums thrown by the society, and spend sleepless nights on their desks. They have to survive by selling candies and newspapers, washing cars in the neighborhood and delivering pizzas to different homes. They have to fight their close ones, and have to walk on a road less taken leaving their comfort zone behind.The above things are essential to succeed. Why? Because they give valuable experiences. They rightly say, experience is a hard teacher - it gives the test first and the lessons afterwords. In the eyes of successful people, experiences make life better, not bitter. What may seem like sufferings are actually trials which tests you, hurt you, cut you, embarrass you - but not to make you weak, but to make you strong so that you can shine like a diamond.So that\'s why one has to "suffer" before becoming successful - because success comes only after experimentation and taking risks, which automatically invites failures. But what we see as sufferings are just the stumbling blocks, which give the successful people necessary strength to convert these into stepping stones.'

S' No, not at all. Dowry is a social menace and no action on the part of the girl can justify you asking for it. If any of her questions and concerns make you feel uncomfortable, then you have the privilege to walk out of talks, but falling to the level of asking dowry only deserves punishment by law.I don\'t want to be rude, but want you to realize that there is a fundamental flaw not only in your argument, but also in your attitude. You wish to compare oranges to oranges but what comparison would you make for the fact that after marriage she would leave her comfortable house, her blood relatives, her childhood friends, her freedom and her dreams to continuously sloth for a total stranger and his family (which happens in typical scenarios)? In almost all cases, an arranged marriage is seen as a ticket for the boy\'s parents to retire comfortably without worrying about cleanliness, food and grand-children, just because the bride is expected to single-handedly look after all of family\'s needs. What would you compare these with? Don\'t think too much, there is nothing. I believe the least you can do is to provide her financial security in the strange-land.In an institution of arranged marriage, where both the parties have very limited time to make decisions, compatibility is primarily judged on quantitative factors like salaries, education and degrees and to some extent on accepted questions on hobbies and family background and not-so-accepted questions like "Are you willing to leave your job and stay at home". Actual relevant things like emotional, mental and physical compatibility, that is essential to any relationship, is almost never thought of. In such a scenario, it\'s not only a girl\'s right, but her duty to ask for the boy\'s salary so that she can convince herself that atleast she can potentially live a comfortable life as far as financial aspect is concerned.The society may frown upon dowry sighting terms like "cheap", "greed" and so on, but all these terms fall short of the actual status it deserves - "unacceptable". Marriage is a sacred relationship where both parties accept each other\'s similarities and differences. Make sure that you don\'t build it\'s foundation on something that is unacceptable.'

S' A disciple asks Buddha, "Guruji, there are many people who constantly argue about various beliefs, some say world is infinite or soul is eternal, others says it doesn\'t exist and so on. I am very confused by these."Buddha, replies "Once a king assembled several blind men in a room and told them, \'Here is an elephant\'. He then gave them a model of different parts of an elephant like his head, tusk, tail, ear and foot. After a couple of minutes, he asks them, \'What sort of thing is an elephant?\' Those who were given the tail said that it\'s like a brush, those given head said its like a pot and so on. And then they began quarreling, \'It\'s like that\', \'No, like that\' and so on."Buddha, smiling, explains to his disciple, "Similar is the case with the people. They only see a particular side of a thing and assume that it represents it entirely. In their ego and lack of knowledge and acceptance, they cling to their points of view, while the truth remains woefully ignored."The huge count of 330 million comes from two factors:Our incomplete realization: Similar to the story above, God is one, but our limited knowledge makes us think that he is like Fire (Agni), Air (Vaayu), creator (Vishnu), Shakti (Goddess) and Knowledge (Saraswati), and our ignorance makes us think that they are different from each other, and hence we count them as distinct.The basic philosophy of Hinduism: This includes aham brahmsmi (I am Brahman (God)) and tat tvam asi (Thou art That). In this way, sages, rivers, rocks, animals, and every human being in general is divine and hence God. The number 330 million comes from Upanishads, and according to me, this would have been the approximate population at the time when Upanishads were written, thus in-line with the above philosophy. Combining with point 1, every individual is counted as distinct.That also explains why scriptures like Gita, etc stresses on the equality of all beings, and doing karma according to dharma. The latter is helpful to the society and thus is just like a prayer to all the Gods in these fellow beings.'

S' Krishna lives on Earth so that you can refer to Gita when confused about your duties and actions, read Ramayana to know how to stick to your responsibilities, learn from Narasimha that anything is possible by thinking out of the box, understand that everything can be lost in an instant by a blind promise by reading about Vamana, and follow the footsteps of Sita, Lakshman and Sudama to become an ideal spouse, sibling and friend. Suppose I tell you that you would be getting 100% in Maths this academic year, what would you do? Go on vacations or study hard? In which case would you actually get 100%? You would probably study hard because you know for sure that going on vacations would certainly not get you that top grade. Similarly, Krishna lives on Earth not because he knows what is going to happen when he is here, but because he knows what the world would become if he doesn\'t come here. Imagine the world with the likes of devils like Ravana or Hiranyaksha, females getting disrobed in the public, brothers killing each other, in short, total chaos spread like an epidemic. Whenever the balance between adharma and dharma shifts in the favor of the former, Krishna comes to restore it back."Yada Yada Hi Dharmasya, Glanirva Bhavathi Bharatha,Abhyuthanam Adharmaysya, Tadatmanam Srijami Aham\'."Whenever there is decay of righteousness O! Bharatha And a rise of unrighteousness, then I manifest Myself!" Bhagavad Gita (Chapter IV-7)You may ask why does he care for the world, why is he so attached to it when he himself says in the Gita to remain unattached? The answer is that he is not.He is doing what he says, he is following his dharma, his responsibility to show us the path, the path to our goals, aspirations and a righteous, fulfilled life.Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow. O son of PRth, there is no work prescribed for Me within all the three planetary systems. Nor am I in want of anything, nor have I a need to obtain anything  and yet I am engaged in prescribed duties. For if I ever failed to engage in carefully performing prescribed duties, O Prtha, certainly all men would follow My path. If I did not perform prescribed duties, all these worlds would be put to ruination, thereby destroying the peace of all living beings. As the ignorant perform their duties with attachment to results, the learned may similarly act, but without attachment, for the sake of leading people on the right path. - Bhagavad Gita (3.21 - 3.25)Hope this clears your doubt.'

It changes its body colors to match the color of its surrounding so that its hard to detect its presence. So sometimes it turns red, sometimes green and so on. In very loose terms, the underlying principle is the same - to hide from the enemy, the tactics are different to suit the scenario at that time.So both the incarnations followed the same principles which are central to Sanatan Dharma - doing karma according to one\'s dharma. The tactics, the actions, the karma was done so as to suit the scenarios. Ram was a warrior in the battle, Krishna was a guru and strategist. Ravana, Drona, Bhishma, Karna, etc had to be killed by different ways, and hence same tactics were not possible to apply. While Ram is known as maryada-purshottam, the epitome of dharma, Krishna is sometimes seen as adopting seemingly unfair means [1]. So they "changed colors" according to the situations, but the driving principles were the same.So in your life, keep your principles strong. Never do any action that compromise these. Your principles define your character.Change your opinions, keep to your principles; change your leaves, keep intact your roots - Victor Hugo[1] : How would you justify all the underhanded tactics that Krishna did?'

While going towards the battlefield, they stopped at the local temple to pray for strength and victory.The general held up a coin and told his army, "I am going to request God to help us defeat the enemy. If this coin lands with the head on top, we would win. Else we would lose. Today our fate is in the hands of the God. Let us all pray to Him".They all prayed for a short time and the general then tossed the coin. It landed with its head up. The soldiers were overjoyed. With their spirits high, given that God was on their side, they fought enthusiastically and won as predicted.Later, the soldiers told him, "We were lucky to have God on our side. Only He determines the outcome.".The general took out the coin from his pocket and showed to them. Both the sides were heads.The above story captures the essence of my answer - yes, it is possible. In fact, I believe you always make your own luck.We hear about great discoveries coming out of lucky accidents, people\'s dreams and so on, but the thing to realize is that these people were not just sitting idle. They were actually working hard in related fields, thinking about the issues 24x7 and perhaps had attempted 1000 other things and failed before they "had a lucky accident" or "got the answer in the dream".So if you want to get lucky, work hard, keep a positive attitude, learn from failures and iterate over them quickly. If you just sit and wait for luck, you would be alone forever. The fact is that luck is waiting for you round the corner, and its upto you how fast you run towards it.'

When I read the question, the first thing that came to my mind was, "Am I already dreaming?" :)For me, it\'s like a dream come true - a dream that I along with several other millions of people saw as a nation - to have more Nobel laureates from India. Mr Kailash Satyarthi, you have made us all very proud. Such a noble deed, and such a nobel prize! Congratulations!To be very frank, I am not happy just because an Indian won a Nobel Prize. Large part of it comes when I think about the significance and possible effects that it can potentially have on our society. Before this news, most of the people neither knew his name nor what he does. But now he would become a household name, getting a place in general knowledge books, 1000s of articles, and millions of tweets and FB updates. With this, people would come to know more about one of the most evil practices prevalent in our society - child labor. They, of course, have heard about it, but the large scale "marketing" would spread awareness among the masses.Here is my little contribution: According to 2009-10 census [1], there were around 5 million children between the age group 5 - 14 who had been denied the right to enjoy childhood privileges like education and had been forced to work in unhealthy environment thus adversely affecting their physical and mental development. Not only this, they are abused, ill-treated, beaten-up and paid very meager wages if at all. Child labor, though itself a huge problem, gives rise to other evils like human trafficking and rapes. It also exposes huge gaps in the society - like poverty, unemployment, lack of schools, inefficient laws and so on. Hence generating awareness about child labor has a much bigger impact as it also highlights a lot of other issues.Kailash Satyarthi [2] is a children\'s rights activist and has been active in the movement against child labour since the 1990s. His organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, has freed over 80,000 children till now and has helped in their successful re-integration, rehabilitation and education. He has not only raided 1000s of factories till now, he has build up a global movement against child labor. He heads the Global March Against Child Labor, a conglomeration of 2000 social-purpose organizations and trade unions in 140 countries [3]. He has also been a part of UNESCO in this regards.This was a summary about the problems and Kailash\'s contributions. I insist you to contribute more.On behalf of 1.2 billion people, especially those children who he has given an opportunity to dream, I would like to send my heart-felt wishes to this great man. Sir, I am sure you would become a role model for a lot of people. Hats off to you! You surely deserve this award as a small token of appreciation for all your selfless efforts in this noble fight.Further reading:[1] Child labour in India [2] Kailash Satyarthi[3] Kailash Satyarthi'

He smiled and asked his disciples, "Why do people shout when angry?"The disciples thought for some time. Some said "because they lose their temper and calm", others said "that they want to stress upon their views" and so on. The saint was obviously not satisfied. Finally, he explained them the reason, "When two people are in love, they talk softly with each other. What happens when the love increases much more? They start whispering. And then comes a point, when they only have to look into each other\'s eyes to convey their thoughts. Now can you guess the answer?"The disciples were still confused. So he continued, "when two people become angry, the distance between their hearts increases. To cover this distance, they need to shout so that they can hear each other. The more the anger, the greater the distance and hence more the shouting."This is what happens. So when you become angry, don\'t let your heart create distance from the other person, because some day it might happen that the distance increases so much that it would be impossible to bridge it.'

S' Some people might say yes because when King Vikramaditya gave her poisoned drink, it changed into nectar - as she describes in her poem Aisi Lagi Lagan: Rana ne vish diya, mano amrit piya. Some other people might say yes because when he pinned iron nails into her bed, they turned into roses.But why even go to these stories and bring in the villain to show the bond between the two? Bollywood might need it, but I do not. Meera roamed around, dancing and singing on the streets, lost in her beloved Krishna. So much was her love that she considered herself to be one of the gopis. And Krishna loved her back. How do I know? Well, when a gopi dances in madness, then Krishna is surely playing his flute somewhere, and when a gopi loses herself in his love, then Krishna surely is filling oceans with his tears, each tear coming from a heart-ful of love.'

S' In 1883, a German immigrant named John Roeblig was inspired to build a spectacular bridge to connect New York with Long Island. As is the case with most of the greatest of ideas, experts in this area mocked him for dreaming about the impossible. But like most of the greatest visionaries, he was not the kind of the person who would be disheartened by the mortals of the time. He successfully convinced his son Washington about the idea and the duo started working on the plan.Few months into the project, there was a tragic accident on site and John lost his life. Washington was left with paralyzing brain injury which resulted him not being able to walk or talk. The people again started whining, "We told so", "Stupid dream" and so on. They even recommended to stop the project since only the Roebligs knew how to build it.But Washington knew that a dream is not that one sees while sleeping, it is the one that doesn\'t let one sleep. He still had a burning desire to complete the project. All he could move was his finger, and he made best use of it - he developed a code of communication with his wife. Under his guidance, his wife learnt mathematics, cable construction, material strength, etc. He used to tap his wife\'s arm to give instructions to her and the engineers.For 13 years, he continued giving guidance through tapping his finger on his wife\'s arm. Today the magnificent Brooklyn Bridge stands in all its glory as one of the most famous icons in New York. With a daily traffic of more than 100,000, this was the first steel wire bridge constructed.This is one of the most inspiring success stories that I have come across. It shows how persistence, hard-work, belief in your dreams and never-say-never attitude can overcome brain damage and disability to deliver somethings almost impossible. It also shows true devotion and love of his wife who decoded his signals for 13 years.Everyone faces obstacles while pursuing their dreams. But whether you give it up or convert the stumbling block into a stepping stone depends whether you listen to someone else or to yourself - and this creates the whole difference between what it is and what it could be.Image credit and further reading: Brooklyn Bridge'

S' If you say Vibhishan, would you prefer naming your child "Vibhishan"? If you choose Karna, would you teach your child to befriend a dishonest, cruel, unrighteous person?In the movie Matrix, Morpheus repeatedly tells Neo, "I can only show you the door. It is you who has to walk through it." Similarly Bhagavad Gita defines dharma and says that dharma varies from person to person, but lets a person choose his own. In regular course of life, it is straightforward, but real test comes during a dilemma. For Vibhishan, it was to choose between his evil brother and his reverent Lord Rama. For Karna, it was a choice between his best friend supporting adharma and Pandavas, his real family fighting for good cause. Each of these choices are right and also wrong. Is it right to leave your family in times of difficulties and challenges? Is it right to support and contribute to the evil side?At this junction, the catch is the following: whatever you choose, you would have to accept the consequences. And the problem reduces to choosing the path where you would be happier to accept the outcome. Vibhishan got a kingdom but have you seen any parent naming their child as Vibhishan? No, because it identifies with the word "traitor". But Vibhishan was happier being a devotee and a traitor than supporting Ravana. Karna got all the respect but had to suffer death in the battle. He preferred to die than to live and be considered as a traitor.So both were right because they consciously made their decision to go to the route they went and happily accepted the consequences.'

S' I don\'t think so. Even if they are, it\'s only skin deep.Using Facebook and Twitter, taking photos from DSLRs, clicking selfies from iPhones, boozing and clubbing on weekends, gym-ing and so on are what I refer to as "skin deep modernism" or what is famously called "Aping the West". And this is what the youth is doing. They are blindly adopting only those things which they can see - in movies, news, etc - and term this as being modern. These things are a part of a lifestyle that has been derived from modern advancement, they are an an indication of modernity, not modernity itself. If today Apple decides to donate iPhones to all of Africa, we won\'t say Africa has become a modern continent.I believe that being modern is a shift in science and technology, how we think, behave and act, and therefore requires a deeper understanding than what is visible in movies. Doing advanced research to develop power efficient phones like iPhone, packing millions of transistors to create Intel-like chips, creating weather-agnostic seeds, attempting to develop low cost drugs for cancer - these are modern advancements. We successfully put Mangalyan on Mars orbit, built nuclear weapons, constructed Metro transportation in cities - these reflected modernity. Modernity means treating servants and waiters with respect, not eve teasing a girl when you see her, neither judging nor caring about others while jogging on streets, not looking down upon a friend who is working part-time in McDonalds to pay his college\'s fees and so on. It requires a radical shift in our thought process that is based on casteism, social statuses, gender inequality, etcParents bashing, coming from the West, is considered to be modern and solution for all problems. But do you know that children in West start earning for themselves from their teens, and pay their own college fees and rent? You cannot decide your own future and then order parents to pay for it. Being independent is modernity, parents bashing is not. A lot of people claim to be feminists, but many of them don\'t even know what it is. Feminism, women empowerment and gender equality are much needed, but it is essential to go one level deep to actually understand these concepts for their effective implementation.So I believe you got the essence of the answer. Becoming modern requires an evolution - in thoughts, education and implementation. It requires deliberate and conscious efforts to get to the root cause of change. Modernity will come when youth would start questioning "Why" and "How" to what they see, and not just adopt these and stop. The evolution process has started, but there is still time before I can say that the youth today is becoming "modern".'

S' Rahul Dravid once said in his speech:I got reading on the Chinese bamboo and learned that the tree takes 5 years, 3 months to grow to its whole height of 80 feet. Yet, for the first 5 years, you can only see a tiny green shoot, but in the next 90 days, it grows into a full-fledged tree. But in those first 60 months, it is growing its strong network of roots underground, to support the tree. In an era of instant gratification, we settle for shorter trees, but remember patience has its reward.Satyameva Jayate translates to "Truth alone triumphs". It does not says always - it says eventually. So you might gain by lying in the short term, but that\'s equivalent of settling with shorter trees. This is not how great nations are built. A nation that has to reach the zenith cannot have a foundation that is built on lying, jugaad and shortsightedness. India is lucky enough that since its early civilization, the teachings of our great sages, mythologies like Mahabharata, festivals like Navratri, in fact the entire culture celebrates the victory of good over evil, dharma over adharma, truth over lying.If we see, one of the major challenge that is pulling us back is corruption. It stops government schools from functioning, vocational institutes from operating, new industries from opening and so on. Truth doesn\'t refer to just "telling", it also encompasses being truthful to your work, to your relationship, to your body and so on. If each one of us today decides to be truthful to our work, wouldn\'t corruption be eliminated? Wouldn\'t be all healthy and following our passion? Wouldn\'t be all living a happy life?So Satyameva Jayate is all truthful and universal, and is an underutilized strategy. But we have to realize that it includes being truthful in all aspects of life, to be truthful to oneself. It\'s a risk-free investment that is sure to return a large fruitful tree.'

If he was so strong, powerful and confident, why didn\'t he single handedly fight Abhimanyu? No, I am neither implying he was less powerful than Abhimanyu or Arjuna nor am I doubting his strength. I just want to highlight the fact that Mahabharata was a dharma-yudh, a fight to establish righteousness and fairness, and Karna not only supported adharma, he was an active contributor. If things were fair before, Mahabharata wouldn\'t have taken place.If you are a dharma believer, then the battle between Arjuna and Karna was as fair as it could be.

A prison for your mind.- The Matrix (1999)Spirituality is for people who have felt that there is more to the world than just materialism, that the world exists beyond what they can touch, see, smell, hear or taste. It's for them who are not satisfied with the world as it appears, who do not find true solace with things around them. It's for them who want to experience limitless joy from their limited and bounded body. They are the truth seekers, trying to bring down the veil of illusion.

S' The simplest strategy to follow would be the following: Anytime you are doing something involving other people, ask yourself - "If others do the same for me, would I like it?" If the answer is no, you are not following dharma.Any action you are performing in general, ask yourself - "If I was earning 10 times less, had a smaller car, was living in half the size of my current house, in short was less fortunate and had a lower so-called social status, would I like that thing to be done?" If no, you are again against your dharma.I wish I could give you a more concrete answer. But if you understand dharma, you would know its not a bunch of mathematical equations or physics formulas. It\'s not even a prescribed set of rules, for if it was, then a policeman would not overspeed to catch a thief or a soldier would not kill to protect his nation. It is a principal, a philosophy which tells an individual to act righteously and responsibly for the betterment of the society. Man, by nature, is selfish and would not want anything bad for himself. The above strategy would help you do good things for others too. I think these questions would help you find the answer.'

S' The word "Navaratri" is a conjunction of two words "nava" (meaning "nine") and "ratri" (meaning "night"). Spread over 9 nights and 10 days, it is one of the most sacred festivals in Hinduism where we worship Goddess Durga or Shakti, which represents the energy of the universe, in her 9 beautiful forms with great reverence.There are various reasons why Navratri is celebrated, and each has its own significance in different parts of India. Let\'s discuss two of these.Killing of MahishasuraOne of the fiercest daemons, Mahishasura undertook severe penance to obtain a boon that he cannot be killed by a male, underestimating at his own cost the power of the female form, and started creating havoc everywhere. To stop him, Shakti took a very beautiful form of Durga and told him that she would marry him if he defeats her in a battle. It is believed that they battled for 9 days, and on the 10th day, Durga killed Mahishasura. Therefore the 10th day is called Vijayadashmi, day of the victory. One of the most famous idols that you see in temples depicts this scene where Mahishasura, in the form of a half bull, is being slayed by Mother Durga.(photo credit: No Sleep Til Turiya)Lord Rama praying to Goddess DurgaAnother legend has it that Lord Rama fasted and prayed for 9 days to seek Goddess\' blessings to kill Ravana. He kills him on the 10th day, and this day is called Dusshera, the day when the 10-headed Ravana was killed.During the period of 9 days of navratri, 9 forms of Durga, called nav-durga, are worshiped in the following order:Shailaputri: She is the primal energy of the trident Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, and was born as daughter (putri) to Himalayas (shaila - mountains)Bhrahmacharini: This form represents penance and austerity leading to blissfulness and mokshaChandraghanta: Represented as 10-armed mother riding a lion, she adores a bell-shaped (ghanta) moon (chandra), and is slayer of evil forces.Kushmanda: Literally meaning "little warmth cosmic egg", she is the creator of the universeSkandamata: She is the mother of Skanda, or Karthikeya, the chief warrior of Gods.Katyayani: As daughter of sage Katyayan, she is a fierce form of Durga.Kaalratri: As death of Kaal (time), she showcases the other side of life - death. She is the most terrible and ruthless form of Durga.Maha Gauri: She represents calmness and grants wisdom to her devotees.Siddhidatri: The fulfiller of all the wishes and giver of boons.(photo credit: Navdurga| Vaishno Devi | Rani Ma Vaishnodevi)During the 9 days, there is a feeling of festivity in the air. Many people fast during the entire period, there are different forms of prayers and lots and lots of varieties of sweets are prepared. Different parts of India celebrate navratri in different styles, the thing that is common is its grandeur and auspiciousness. The two most famous styles are below:In Gujarat, people do dandiya and garba, a beautiful folk dance, wearing colorful dresses.(photo credit: Navratri Festival..)In West Bengal, navratri is celebrated as Durga Puja and large scale prayers are organized in the praise of Durga.(photo credit: Curtain raiser for Durga Puja in Kolkata)'

S' It was 5th November 2013 when India\'s historic Mars mission Mangalyaan made tryst with destiny and social media, instead of being a part of the dream very few could see, was flooded with questions like "Why waste money on the Mars mission when it could have been used for education, poverty and hunger reduction, healthcare and so on?" And today, when Mangalyaan conquered Mars, the world is at a loss of words. There are no questions being asked, no comments being passed. It\'s just pure admiration, admiration for the dream, admiration of the work well done, admiration that it just took $75 million compared to NASA\'s $671 million, admiration that India is the first and the only country in the world to reach Mars\' orbit in its first attempt. "India" and "ISRO" are trending on Twitter, people are going crazy on Facebook and NASA has become a laughing stock. ISRO has proved actions speak louder than words. So my first feelings are expressed through a combination of lovely quotes:You have to dream before your dream comes true - Abdul KalamEnjoy the game and chase your dreams. Dreams do come true - Sachin TendulkarPutting an object in the Mars\' orbit is not just a child\'s play. The aircraft has to successfully launch from the Earch, travel 29760000 km to reach Mars and then fire the right rockets at the right time for the precise duration. It is an extraordinary feat, rare to achieve, and shows excellence and brilliance in Maths, Physics, Astronomy, Manufacturing and so on. The international media is full of praise for India. NASA itself has send its heartiest congratulations. People in the entire world are giving a standing ovation. Today, India has earned renewed respect, and I am feeling it trickling down to me.Unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. In this world, fear has no place. Only strength respects strength. - Abdul KalamAchievements like these not only influences the present population, but it inspires the future generations to dream, to aspire for the impossible and to get fascinated by Science and make godly advancement in the field. It becomes a reason for the entire country to unite and feel proud, and bring confidence to the minds of the people about the future progress.I cannot express in words how proud and happy I am to be fortunate enough to witness this historic moment. I congratulate India, ISRO and innumerable hidden faces that made this achievement possible. I would like to end this with a part of speech which Jawaharlal Nehru gave on India\'s Independence:The achievement we celebrate today is but a step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and achievements that await us. Are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?I know we are, we just have to prove it. Congratulations in advance for many more to come. To India, I bow, Jai Hind.'

Wouldn\'t have history remembered Karna as someone who ran and hid under his father\'s protection when the time came to battle face to face with his only worthy opponent Arjuna? Wouldn\'t the world have marked his action of donating his protective earrings and sheath to Indra as pure publicity stunt if Karna had taken the protection provided by his father? What better death can befit someone as brave and powerful as Karna than dying at the command of peerless Lord Krishna? Death is certain for anyone born here, especially when Lord is sitting in the chariot opposite to him, wishing that he dies - no sun or moon can save him. Clearly Surya understood that. Wouldn\'t have he put a blot on his son\'s life by his intention of helping him?Surya on that day didn\'t only follow his dharma towards the nature, but a greater dharma towards his son by letting him die in the fashion he deserved. If Surya had helped him, all the respect, glory and his status as epitome of karma, generosity, bravery and courage would have died with him. Karna didn\'t live to die, but died to live, taking a place in history that perhaps even Arjuna couldn\'t take. Who wouldn\'t be proud to have a son like him?Sun did set early that day.

S' No, not at all. Lack of education is the biggest evil, followed by the politicians who believe in divide and rule as far as caste system is concerned in modern India.If you had asked this question 60 years ago, I would have shouted Yes. While there are several theories on the origin of the caste system, ranging from corrupt and powerful brahmins and kings to foreign invaders, brahmins did enjoy an upper hand. Caste system was one of the biggest evil when India got independence. In fact, Mahatma Gandhi started the Harijan movement to create awareness about its adverse social impact.(src: Caste system in India)But after 67 years of real "India", it is unjustified to blame the brahmins for the system enjoyed by their ancestors. While earlier, brahmin used to influence laws, occupy various positions just because of their castes and deny lower caste people of any opportunity, after India\'s independence, there has been no law which has favored the brahmin castes, nor any special position created for them. Like sati and slowly dowry, these social evils can be addressed only by education and awareness, and if the Indian political framework has failed to provide these to each child and citizen, then brahmins are not at fault. As per the needs of the hour, reservations were rightly introduced, but today even these policies have become a source of divide and a leverage for political vote bank.There is a reason why caste system is lower in urban areas, and why many people in today\'s younger generation don\'t believe in it - because of education, awareness and rise of social media. If the evil system is prevailing in the society, it\'s not due brahmins, but due to the lack of political will to tackle the problem at its root.'

S' I put "Idol worship is not permitted in Hinduism" in Bing Translate, and after a chain of multiple languages, English->Bulgarian->..->Chinese->..->Danish, the final result was, "In the Hindu ban on worship"!!So consider this hypothetical case: An old learned sage tells his young student, "Idol worship is permitted in Hinduism". A devotee comes to the student\'s house and asks him about his views on idol worship to which the student replies, "Idol worship is permitted, but not necessary." Like in Chinese-Whisper game, the devotee who was half-listening, thinks that what he heard was "Idol worship is not permitted" and writes this in a book. A Chinese person, inquisitive about Hinduism translates this in Chinese which get translated to Danish by a Danish scholar. An Indian goes to a Euro trip, buys the book and uses Bing to translate it back to English, which eventually gives birth to Advaita Vedanta philosophy. So you see how over time, 3 very different schools of thoughts can be formed?Building up on this example, let\'s see some of the many reason why Hinduism appears so complex:Very ancient: Depending on your beliefs, Hinduism is atleast 7000 years old. Initially the knowledge was transferred orally which then got written in some ancient language and further got translated in many languages, many times. Each scripture has 2 parts: a universal and a temporal. Often these gets mixed and misinterpreted by different authors leading to deviation.Dharmic nature: Unlike Abrahamic religions, Hinduism doesn\'t have a list of Do\'s and Don\'ts. It\'s basic principles are karma, dharma, truth, etc which changes from person to person, from time to time. A person who doesn\'t understand these principles sees seven colors in the sky, while for others, it\'s one beautiful rainbow.Aham Brahmasmi, Tat Tvam Asi: Which means I am Brahman, so are you. In Hinduism, every living being is equal and God resides in all. Therefore, we worship our parents, teachers, plants and animals. From childhood, we see inequality, and hence this complexity, otherwise it is simply universality.Freedom and Easy to misuse: With great freedom comes great responsibility, but many people don\'t realize this. So they misuse Hinduism\'s open-endedness to modify or frame policies to benefit a certain section of people. This has added a lot of noise over time like superstitions, dowry, caste system, self-made babas, etc which demotivates people to study about the real greatness.For a beginner, "light" would seem to be a mystery - it\'s a wave, particle, colored, visible, invisible and so on. But then, we systematically study it\'s properties and Physics behind it over certain years to appreciate it\'s intrinsic beautiful form. Similarly, to understand Hinduism, you have to put some efforts. Start with some basic stuff without overwhelming yourself by it\'s vastness. Read some Quora answers, good commentaries and scriptures, watch mythological shows on Youtube and you would realize that Hinduism is not at all a mystery, but a very easy path to follow for a common man.'

S' All of the following things I already knew, but Quora helped me actually implement these in my life, and therefore it has been my honorable guru.Act, not react: Sometimes I get very hateful and mocking comments. In the beginning, I used to get angry and enter into never-ending tug-of-war, but slowly by practicing Be Nice Be Respectful policy, I learnt how to control my anger, subdue my temptation to to reply instantly and be respectful. Importance of patience and persistence: Quora algorithms test your patience. I didn\'t write for couple of month due to personal reasons. When I came back, I found it very difficult to get views for the answers. But then nothing is achieved without persistence, so I motivated myself to keep on writing hoping that these algorithms would "learn" as time passes, and they did.How to organize my thoughts: I spend a large amount of time thinking about an answer, even if it is small. This has helped me to reduce noise in my thinking and focus on the essence of the question in hand.Startups need not do different things, but do things differently: I had never imagined a better platform than Wikipedia for knowledge, but then came Quora. They added a human element to it. People started explaining complex phenomenon in layman terms, I got to know and interact with like-minded people and so on.Do karma without worrying about the results: I read this quote in Bhagavad Gita, but Quora helped me apply this in everyday life. In the beginning, I was very obsessed with upvotes and used to feel bad when got only a few. But then slowly I realized that the only thing I controlled was writing here, and that I should write good answers so that people can derive some knowledge from these - anytime in future. In the end, what matters is the footprints you leave in the sands of time.'

S' Let\'s consider an example to understand the subtlety. Suppose you want to write an answer on Quora to get large number of upvotes. What all things are under your control? You can only write a well-explained answer - you cannot control the number of votes. And therefore Gita says that don\'t expect upvotes or worry about those, just do your karma of writing great answers and treat this as your dharma to pass knowledge to the readers (which is what Quora\'s mission is: To share and grow the world\'s knowledge)Now\'s let draw an analogy. Whatever Krishna did was to establish dharma because that was his dharma! As a guide for the entire society, his duty was to make the righteous side win, and hence all his actions were directed towards this duty - just like your writing a great answer to spread knowledge.But he neither expected nor expressed the right to the fruits. In fact, after passing down all the knowledge, he gives Arjuna the freedom to choose whatever he wants to do with it. This is the final message of Krishna to Arjuna:iti te jnam khyta, guhyd guhyatara may,vimyaitad aeea, yathecchasi tath kuruWhich means, "Thus I have given to you all the confidential knowledge. Deliberate on this with your full heart and mind, and then do what you wish to do."So just like readers and Quora algorithms decide the upvotes, Krishna only performed his duty and then let Arjuna and others to decide what the actual fruit be. And just like your awesome answer would eventually fetch a lot of upvotes, so did the righteous side win. Krishna just followed his dharma, and let time to decide the outcome.'

It surely can, but the problem arises when you start to pursue money itself rather than happiness.

Things for sure would not always go the way you wanted them to be. But the key to happiness is to take lessons from the past and let it go. Similarly, future is uncertain. If you worry too much about all the "What ifs" and "Hows", you would never be able to enjoy the only moment you have - the present. Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift.

You go on a vacation at your favorite place all happy, but when you come back and go on Facebook and see photos of your friends having fun, you immediately think how boring yours was compared to theirs which brings you misery. You feel really happy while learning guitar in pursuit of your hobby, but when you see someone else performing on stage, you immediately get dissatisfied. The following quote beautifully summarizes how to pursue real happiness.Dont rely on someone else for your happiness and self-worth. Only you can be responsible for that. If you cant love and respect yourself  no one else will be able to make that happen. Accept who you are  completely; the good and the bad  and make changes as YOU see fit  not because you think someone else wants you to be different. - Stacey Charter'

S' Once Swami Vivekananda visited King of Alwar in present day Rajasthan. The king in an attempt to mock idol worship told Swamiji, "I\'ve no faith in idol worship. How can one worship stone, wood and metal? I believe people are in illusion and just wasting time!". Swamiji smiled. He asked the king\'s assistant to take down the picture of the king that was hanging on the wall. Although confused, the assistant did so. Then Swamiji ordered him, "Spit on the picture!". The assistant was shocked and looked at both of them. Swami repeated again and again, becoming more stern each time. The king was growing angry and the assistant started trembling. Finally, he cried out, "How can I spit on this? This picture is of our beloved and respected king!".Swamiji then told him, "The king is sitting in front of you in person. This picture is merely a paper - it does not speak, hear, think or move. But still you did not spit because you see a shadow of your king in it, Spitting on it was like spitting on the king itself." The king looked at Swamiji and bowed down, clearly understanding what he was referring to.This is the essence of idol worshiping. God is everywhere, but people want to pray to Him, ask favors, offer food, tell stories, bathe Him, play with Him and do what they do in their lives. Creating a human-like idol creates an image of God as a companion, a guide, a friend, a protector, a giver, a fellow being and so on. An idol is just a concrete representation where they find Him. When I look into the eyes of an idol, I do not see stone or metal, but another pair of eyes looking affectionately at me, smiling.'

Not only this, Urmila, his wife promises him that she would not let a single tear flow from her eyes, lest he becomes weak in his decision.

S' Because it gives you the courage to say, "yes, I can do it!"There was once a foreign language class going on where students were coming one by one to speak a paragraph that they had learnt. It was was Tom\'s turn. When he started, the teacher shouted, "No!". So he stopped and started again, when the teacher again thundered, "No!". Tom sat down feeling embarrassed. Now next Kim stood up and started speaking when the teacher again shouted, "No!". But Kim continued and when he was done, the teacher praised him, "Excellent!"So after the class, Tom goes to the teacher and complains, "I started better than Kim and I knew the entire story too." The teacher looks into Tom\'s eyes smiling, and explains, "Knowing the story is not enough. When I said no, you stopped because you were doubtful. You have to be sure of yourself. The world will keep saying \'No!\', but you have to respond saying \'Yes!\' and prove them wrong."So this is why confidence is required. Your mind will tell you not to talk to that girl, your friends would advice you that the interview is out of your reach and your peers would warn you that job is just too difficult. Your intelligence and smartness all get locked by \'Ifs\', \'Buts\' and 100s of doubts in your mind. Confidence is the key that opens the doors, and let intelligence and smartness fly high. Confidence is the fuel of the car, all other things are just its parts - essential, but worthless without the fuel.'

S' Lord Shiva perfectly knew that Ganesh was his son and Ganesh knew that Shiva was his father. A lot of people have questions about dharma: who makes it, is it the same for everyone and so on. Let\'s dive into mythology to find some answers.Some time after ocean-churning (Samudra manthan), Shiva realized that his great "sacrifice" of drinking poison was in vain - people were misusing money and power, and disorder was prevailing in the society. So he went on penance to think about the situation. During his absence, the situation got worse. Following her dharma to restore balance, Goddess Parvati created Ganesh through her powers whose objective was to bring wealth and prosperity in the world (that\'s why we associate riddhi-siddhi and shubh-labh with his name). After some time, when Parvati came to know that Shiva is returning, she decided to take a special Suchita bath and dress up to meet him. She instructed Ganesha that no-one should be allowed to enter the chamber.Now Shiva came and went straight to meet his beloved wife after such a long time, only to be stopped by Ganesha. He told him he is his father, but he didn\'t relent. Other Gods tried to convince Ganesha to let Shiva in, but he mocked them all. Shiva did not become angry for not being able to see Parvati, but because he saw Ganesh having greed, over-confidence, disrespect and ego that had belittled his intelligence. How could Ganesh spread prosperity, when he himself had selfishness? Shiva realized that Ganesh was not fit to fulfill his objective, and punished him by cutting his head. When Parvati came to know about it, she became very angry because of her love and started destroying the world with her powers which forced Shiva to give back Ganesh his life by attaching elephant\'s head. So in this way, Ganesh also learnt his lesson.It was dharma all along - Parvati\'s as a mother of the world and of Ganesh; Ganesh\'s to keep his mother\'s promise and Shiva\'s to destroy negative characteristics like ego (tamo-guna) even if the person was his own son. So dharma is situation dependent, is chosen by own self and is different for different people.So Shiva knew about Ganesh, but in the end, even Gods have to follow their dharma.'

S' I am sure you have heard several stories about students leaving CS in non-IIT institutes to join any department in IIT. You might have heard your mother telling you how smart Sharma uncle\'s son is just because he is an IITian. You might also have seen many students showing off their IIT T-shirts. So yes, students, in fact the society in general, see IIT as a brand. But let\'s say in future, some college Indian Institute of Better Technology (IIBT) is established that is better than IITs, would you still be that crazy about IITs? Obviously not. So the point is the brand is because of the institution, and not vice versa. These two are like different faces of the same coin, and therefore when you talk about IIT as a brand, it encapsulates the institution within it.They say, "what\'s in a name?", but the truth is most often than not, our lives revolve around all these names and brands. But what you have to realize is that to create a brand, it takes a lot of efforts. If Apple had started yesterday, would you be buying its products today? It has taken several years of constant excellence, failures, investment, innovation and customer satisfaction to create a brand out of a name. This is what Brand Messi is:"I start early, and I stay late, day after day after day, year after year. It took me 17 years and 114 days to become an overnight success."--Lionel MessiSimilarly, IIT has become a brand today because of great professors, successful alumni, autonomy, huge investment and the talent that goes in. So yes, what the society sees is just the brand, but the brand is so developed that it is enough to capture the product/institute within it.'

S' Consider a bird. When it is a baby, it resides in the nest and cannot fly. Its parents bring food for it. So it generally develops a psychological dependence that must be overcome. Parent birds begin to teach them flying by remaining a short distance away during feeding - so the baby bird has to step away from the nest, and "fly" towards the food. In the initial stages, it falls many times, but eventually spreads its wings to conquer the mighty sky.(Flying on the wings of vulnerability)Each child that is born is like a baby bird, which has the potential to fly high and explore the hidden treasures of the world. They are not born with a non-creative gene. So why are Indian students generally non-creative? Let\'s get back to the bird example.Parent birds endeavor to make their children independent. If a child is kept in protection till the age of 22, he has already lost his best years of creativity. In the West, a child from the beginning is taught to be independent. They earn their own pocket-money, save money for college, etc. So they are forced to find ways to earn their living while young which leads to a creative, innovative and entrepreneurial attitude.What if the parent birds send their baby birds to a famous, reward-guaranteed, future-securing hunting course taught by a lion? However hard anyone tries, the birds will neither learn to fly nor hunt like a lion, and they would lose all their confidence. Similarly, forcing the children to become an engineer or a doctor without respecting their interests kill all their dreams to fly.What if the parent birds teach their baby birds only to compete against other birds for food? Wouldn\'t the birds then only concentrate on food? From the Montessori itself Indian students are just told to get good marks. If that\'s what the goal is for a student, and also the only way to earn respect in the society, then why waste time thinking outside the box?Beside the society and parents, students are to be blamed too. They don\'t want to take risk and care too much about what others think of them. A society trained to appreciate just marks would only judge you on that parameter, and one needs to have the courage to ignore "log kya kahenge" (what would society say), take risk and believe in his dreams to do somethings different or do usual things differently.'

You might become a millionaire too.Not giving/taking a bribe would make you understand your responsibility and help control your actions in the face of temptations (for lower fine/ extra money).Not throwing that garbage on the road will keep your environment clean and may prevent diseases in your family.Every little contribution you make, every penny you spend on building this nation is like an investment, like money being put aside in some retirement plan - it would disappear for now, but in the background would keep on compounding, and some day, when it comes back to you, you would be more than grateful and proud of your past for doing that.'

S' There once lived a boy who had a bad temper. He would get angry at every little thing. One day, his father gave him a bag of nails and told him, "Every time you get angry, hammer a nail into that front wall."And so the activity started. On the first day, the boy hammered 50 nails. The next day, he hammered 40. Each time he used to go there, he repented being angry - it was quite a challenge to hammer a nail into that damn brick wall! Slowly, he discovered that controlling anger was easier than hammering, and the number of nails hammered started going down.Eventually, a day came when he didn\'t get angry, and he felt the joy of it. Now his father gave him another task, "If you do not get angry the entire day, remove one nail from the wall." After several days, all the nails were removed.Now his father took him near the wall and asked him what did he see. The boy replied that he can see holes in the wall. The father then explained to his son: "These holes are like the scars that you leave on people when you get angry. No matter how many times you say sorry, the scar does not go."So I suggest you two things:Realize that words once spoken cannot come back. Your anger hurts others and leaves a sour impression that lasts forever.Each time you get angry, "hammer a nail". Simplest thing you can do is to carry a pocket diary and put a line each time you get angry. Then at night, count the number of lines for that day. If you make this a habit, each time you would get angry, you would be reminded to note it down. Indirectly, you would also realize that you getting angry. And because you are conscious and aware at that time, you would find it easier to control your actions and subdue anger.I hope the day comes soon when you don\'t have any line in your diary.'

Comments would range from "Indeed, hail Lord Krishna!" to "I do not want to burst your bubble, but I wonder what more stupidity can I expect from you. Stop spreading rumors....Science says...what is the proof...." and so on.And that\'s the point. After reading the above "fact", do you now "know" it? No. Texts and words turn into knowledge when you accept these. Knowing and accepting are two different things.Kauravas were told by a lot of people, including their gurus, but they never accepted it. And people like Bhishma, who accepted it, were just following their dharma by fighting from the side of Kauravas. So none of them had any reason to fear Krishna.'

S' Note: There are assumptions in your question that can be challenged, but I won\'t since I feel that they aren\'t consequential enough to be attacked.Two reasons:1. The woman who are "downtrodden" have less time, resources and power to make a presence for themselves in the news and popular media due to systemic historical inequalities, and so you hear and read less about their lives and their work. This is almost tautological. From here, it also proceeds that enacting legislative changes or plotting similar projects aimed to have broad influence on society are many orders of magnitude harder for them.2. A feminism practiced without taking cognizance of the varied intersecting identities (of race, class, gender, sexuality etc) held by an individual -- each affecting an individual\'s place in social hierarchies of power -- is hobbled by blinkered views of what issues are "truly" important and pressing. So quite simply, the most privileged women are the ones with the most time and ability to talk the talk and walk the walk, the cultural spotlight will swivel towards "their" issues.Oh, and in case there is any doubt, your observation is not some "gotcha" moment that exposes feminism\'s hollow core. It is a depressing but expected consequence of the kind of biases that affect any human endeavor. The development and practice of intersectional feminism points the route towards trying harder and being better.'

S' Okay I\'m coming into this with good faith and trying to engage with her video as art, since she says she intends it to be so.I was confused about her intentions as well, and I didn\'t find the video very erotic or even emotionally resonant as some art has done for me. The "turn" in the second half where it got violent was somewhat disturbing.Amid the great vitriol and whore/rape/slut categories of comments I saw in the comments section on that page, there were some thoughtful explorations of what the purpose of this video might be. That opened up the experiment for me a bit. After a few days of thought I\'ve settled on the central idea being explored to be the ambiguities of consent and our role in grappling with it, as consumers and participants of sex.I don\'t give the "re-enactment" bit too much credence. At some level, OF COURSE it is, but that\'s just boring. She stands to distract from her message by calling it that. Her intent I believe is merely to use that experience as a template to illustrate the fuzzy nature of consent, how a consensual experience can turn unexpectedly not-so, and how a person might grapple with such an experience, and here I mean the audience, more than herself.Does the video\'s existence equate to us having her consent to watch it? If she made it willingly and uploaded it on her personal website for (potential) public viewing, does it still mean all of us have a right to view it? (compare with \'even if she\'s naked she\'s not asking for it...\') At least one person said that the text on her website in sum meant that he did not feel she had consented to have him watching her video and so he was not going to. Instead he emailed her to ask if he could watch it. I count that as a genuine example of engagement and a specific human response to the art piece, though it need not be how all of us react to it. At the very baseline level, I feel she is saying that her making and putting up the video voluntarily does not excuse thoughtless viewing, of considering intellectual and moral restrictions that might still be applicable which we are to supposed to impose on ourselves and then live up to unsupervised by her or society. If that sounds like a simply ridiculous standard of consent, well then perhaps it is intentionally so - a way to shock a population that often has a ridiculously low standard of consent.The video also invites us to think about the rape we commit in the viewing. Taking it not quite literally, as a metaphor for the sexual violence the public at large allows by not trusting the lived experiences of women, the intercourse feels a bit like a challenge or a test. She says she wants us to not be part of her rape. By asking us to set a boundary for ourselves, she wants us to state a line that we will not cross, after what point we would say that we too as spectators contributed to the crime. This is especially resonant in the wake of The Fappening/iPhone photo leak. As just mentioned, one person decided it\'s not for him to assume any consent regarding the video at all. I thought that the male actor was a stand-in for me and other viewers. In that light, we had the consent to watch the video, only up to the point where the sex was consensual. This emphasizes the "ongoing" aspect in the definition of consent. If she is telling the man to stop, has consent ended for us as well? Should we watch no further? If we keep going to see the man keep going, isn\'t that a violation?The act of us viewing this video is a stand-in for the role the public-at-large plays in the life of a rape victim in the days and weeks and months forward. For me, my desire to keep watching the video equated, in some sense, to the male participant\'s desire to disregard her pleas for him to stop. Part of this I also read to be an implicit equating of audience and participant. When I think of how easy it was for me to keep watching, I feel drawn to understand that the male participant also viewed her in the same passive, objectifying manner, as entertainment on a screen, and the end conclusion of this line of thinking being that violation of consent happens when objectification sabotages conscious participation and turns it into spectacle.Lastly, I would make a aesthetic note about the 4 camera setup. I feel a grim sense of humor, or if humor is the wrong word, irony. What could be more atypical of the usual state of such nights, whose later investigations are frequently encumbered by lack of evidence troubled memories and conflicting accounts? The mood of hyper surveillance created by her choices in filming the video seem to mock standards of certainty, our rational insistence on requiring evidence before bestowing the victim with our belief. She seems to say - "If you had such footage of my actual rape, would that satisfy you? Would I then earn your unreserved support? I\'m not so sure."'

S' The most prominent example of such a feud on TV right now is between Julianna Marguiles and Archie Punjabi on The Good Wife. The friendship between the two women characters was one the big draws of the show in the early seasons. Speculation has been rife since season 5 when they suddenly stopped appearing in scenes together, appeared to talk only through phone calls and kept "missing" each other though they worked in the same office.Though the conversations about the feud are unfounded speculations, the actors and producers of the show have pointedly deferred answering the question, suggesting that there are some difficulties. The most common reasons discussed online are Marguiles being uncomfortable with Panjabi\'s character Kalinda Sharma being a breakout hit and stealing focus away from her Alicia Florrick, since she is ostensibly the lead and titular \'Good Wife.\'Archie Punjabi has left the show as of the Season 6 finale which concluded last week and it has been confirmed by news sources that the final scene between the two characters was shot using stand-ins and camera angle tricks. At the time of her departure, the two characters had not had a scene together for over 50 episodes.'

S' Anti-Americanism proceeded in several stages as outlined in a very nice review by Professor James Caesar at Page on syr.edu, which I have briefly summarized below: "Degeneracy thesis": Even before the founding of a country by the name of America, European thinkers proposed that the New World is "degenerate" due to its atmospheric conditions such as high humidity. The chief propagators of this theory were biologist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon as well as writer of a three-volume study of America, Cornelius de Pauw (who said "it is a great and terrible spectacle to see one half of the globe so disfavored by nature that everything found there is degenerate or monstrous.")In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton writes:Men admired as profound philosophers gravely asserted that all animals, and with them the human species, degenerate in America that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed awhile in our atmosphere.Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson later wrote long responses refuting these claims, battling perceptions summarized by writer Guillaume Thomas Franois Raynal as: "America has not yet produced a good poet, an able mathematician, one man of genius in a single art or a single science."An Intellectual Basis: Proceeding from these naturalist objections, Anti-Americanism then shifted to an ideological foundation - the argument that the basic values upon which the country was founded were profane or suspect. Conservative philosophers who disagreed with the principles upon which the French Revolution was based, ideas of man and equality, looked to the American Revolution as a precursor worth equal derision. People like Joseph de Maistre and Edmund Burke found the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution suspect and thought the country could not endure on these values for long. Maistre said:"All that is new in [America\'s] constitution, all that results from common deliberation is the most fragile thing in the world: one could not bring together more symptoms of weakness and decay."Romantic thinkers also objected to the idea of a society based on reason, believing that no real culture or nation could be founded on such principles. The poet Nikolaus Lenau said:"With the expression Bodenlosigkeit [rootlessness] I think I am able to indicate the general character of all American institutions; what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme." while another Romantic poet Heinrich Heine suggested:"Sometimes it comes to my mind/To sail to America/To that pigpen of Freedom/Inhabited by boors living in equality."Racial Impurity: By the 19th century, theories about the hierarchical divisions of the races and their differing abilities led to another strain of Anti-Americanism. The view, best captured by the writings of Arthur de Gobineau was that America was supposed to have been the Great White Hope for the Anglo-Saxon and Nordic races, but with its Enlightenment ideals was headed in the direction of mingling and lowering the Anglo-Saxon race with the "garbage races" of Europe. Although racialist theories have been debunked, some of Gobineau\'s analysis is retained, used to argue that America fosters a culture of "blandness and homogeneity," while others complain that the amalgamation promised has not proceeded fast enough.Resistance to Modernization: "The breathless haste with which they [the Americans] work-the distinctive vice of the new world-is already beginning ferociously to infect old Europe and is spreading a spiritual emptiness over the continent." said Nietzsche about America industry, its mass production and mass industrialization. Later a disciple of his Arthur Moeller van den Bruck wrote that Americanness should be "not geographically but spiritually understood" and that it is "the decisive step by which we make our way from a dependence on the earth to the use of the earth, the step that mechanizes and electrifies inanimate material and makes the elements of the world into agencies of human use."Consumerism: In 1935, German philosopher Martin Heidegger (who previously had said that America waskatestrophenhaft, the site of catastrophe) wrote:Europe lies today in a great pincer, squeezed between Russia on the one side and America on the other. From a metaphysical point of view, Russia and America are the same, with the same dreary technological frenzy and the same unrestricted organization of the average man.But Heidegger believed that Russian Bolshevism was only a variant of Americanism and considered Russia less of a problem than America because there could at least be dialogue with Marxists since they had a sense of history, while America had none. What was essentially going on was that several strands of thought that were threatened by everything commodified and mass produced wanted to create an anti-technological agenda but since "technology" was not enough of a real thing for people to hate, seized upon the idea of America as a symbol for everything that\'s wrong about where progress was taking us. Heidegger went on to say:"Consumption for the sake of consumption is the sole procedure that distinctively characterizes the history of a world that has become an unworld.... Being today means being replaceable." He also cited Rainer Marie Rilke\'s thoughts about America:Now is emerging from out of America pure undifferentiated things, mere things of appearance, sham articles.... A house in the American understanding, an American apple or an American vine has nothing in common with the house, the fruit, or the grape that had been adopted in the hopes and thoughts of our forefathersOne may note that these ideas are common even today among people of all ideological inclinations, even those who would balk at being associated with the proto-Nazism of Heidegger.'

S' The rubric that makes sense to me is that: a piece of work can be great only if it utilizes its medium such that it cannot be remade into any other medium.For a visual novel, I would say that one of the conditions for it being considered great would be that it integrates into something more than the sum of its panels and balloon text. If it didn\'t, i.e, it could work as well as a movie or a novel, then it\'s not a really great visual novel.I\'d actually asked a question about this thought and its significance to comic books a couple of years ago and I\'d gotten a response that can serve as a great example of what I mean:Douglas Currens\' answer to What are some great examples of comic books that fully utilize the medium?Promethea #32, the final issue of the series, while full of images and comments and "dialogue" on every page, was ALSO designed to be cut apart and reassembled into two very large 16-page portraits of Promethea!

Here\'s one of the 16-page portraits...In addition, the artistic styles of the earlier issues were often tributes to famous artists, and the color scheme changed according to the part of the Kaballah\'s Tree of Life Promethea was visiting in those issues.

S' Hmmm, lets see:My choice; to be a size 0 or a size 15I wince a bit still for the moment "size 15" is spoken the image we see on screen is that of a pregnant woman. Would an actual size 15 on screen have been too radical a notion? This attempt at solidarity with plus sized women falls short of actually doing them the kindness of actual representation. The bigger problem here is the manner in which a smooth, linear quantization of women\'s bodies is proposed and championed. By suggesting that a woman is "free" to be span the whole range of 0-15, what Vogue is actually doing is exploiting a cognitive bias called Anchoring which is the tendency for humans to focus on the first piece of information presented to them when conducting a negotiation. This linear range offered "anchors" our expectations of how we can describe a body to a single linear dimension when in reality the diversity of human beings should need more than a single reductive number to describe it. This suits the capitalist commodifying needs of Vogue and the fashion industry, which wants standardized sizes for a) optimal mass production, b) setup a linear spectrum of attractiveness pegged to this scale and c) induce aspirational anxieties that drives women to attempt to hoodwink genes and nature in the pursuit of going up a scale that is not necessarily the best way to measure a body in the first place. Whenever a capitalist entity advocates for feminism, one can always expect it to enlist it in service of their capitalist agenda, and I believe it\'s important to be aware of that.The second problem I would mention is that it erases the experiences of many women who might simply have no choice in the matter of what size they are. There is a breeziness in the manner at which the choice of size is presented, as if it shifting from one end to another were a matter of dieting and exercise when many women might have have very real hindrances to ever achieving their ideal size. Things like diabetes, thyroid issues and even just genetics are real factors that real people face and can lock them out of realistically ever getting to a size of their choice.To have sex before marriage, to have sex out of marriage, or to not have sexAah, the big bogeyman that has everyone\'s panties in a bunch. Personally, I disagree with all the criticisms that people have assessed as applicable to this section of the piece. Because they all feel (in increasing order of what I have to say about them):too easy a criticism to make (adultery hurts people - duh?),the criticism easily panders to men who have internalized a fear of the sexually proactive woman and the sexual free-market that feminism and modernization seem to promise ("The whores are coming! The whores are coming!").they miss the value of asserting and reminding people of the idea that sometimes certain, particular women can be terrible and adulterous but there\'s no greater meaning in that than what it tells us about their individual personalities. Just as there is a certain sexism in the fact that women are shut out of certain criminal careers like petty theft, contract murders, racketeering etc, there is a sexism in insisting that women should not possibly be just bad people who happen to like adultery. If a percentage of men can be assholes, so should a percentage of women, if they so desire. So I don\'t like the idea of preaching to women against adultery. And if you say your plea was gender neutral, then duh, everyone already knows it\'s a bad thing to do, see point 1.they shut down any measured discussion of the sheer variety of sexual relationships found inside Indian marriages. This is a subject that is hardly focused upon. Open marriages are one example that other people have perhaps mentioned but are likely to be a minority. To get down to brass tacks, no one is talking about the the generations of women in their 30, 40s and 50s who are stuck in acrimonious loveless marriages. Marriages which might be violent or marriages where the spouse might just be sexually distant and unavailable (or simply philandering with the maid). Where the couple might not have had sex since their last child was conceived, which might have been a decade ago. Or even widows who are now expected to be sexless and partner-less the rest of their lives since their children are grown up and settled and why, after all, would a woman want sex at that stage? I personally know of people whose parents\' marriages are in such doldrums (or perhaps 9th circle of hell would be more apropos). For women in such marriages, who have perhaps never given a thought to prioritizing their own well being over family appearances, it would be a vital and crucial idea for them to start thinking about having an affair with mutual consent with a partner that can make them happy.The overall problem, I feel, is that Indian people\'s anxieties about dating in the modern age tend to make them think of romantic coupling as (in part or whole) an adversarial endeavor while completely ignoring the great role adultery can provide as a pressure valve in so many hellish relationships among the older arranged-marriage generation which actually are adversarial and absolutely horrible and torturous. Fears of the other, darker side of the "Dating" system manifest themselves here - a shiny car we\'ve (as a culture) started test driving with aplomb but neglected to read the operating manual fully. The solution is not to create an environment of self-righteousness about adultery as some kind of social insurance policy in case we\'re on the receiving end one day, but to realize that it is contingent upon ourselves to choose a partner and build the kind of relationship where it would never come into the equation.The rest of the piece is worth little remark except to say that it unfortunately indulges in the same kind of adversarial world view of modern relationships that I just advocated against. The problem being that the audience for this video would include women and men who broadly agree with its message but would take offense at the tone, as if the humdrum things being talked about, like when to have a baby or when one should come home at night is so out of the realm of possibility for a couple to achieve mature understanding upon, that it becomes a point of defiance and Amazonian courage. It talks down to the men and women it is primarily speaking to, with some bamboozling poetic fancies in the mix, and so alienates people who would broadly agree with what it is trying to champion. The gender equality issues that are a terrain of politics and negotiation within couples of the Indian middle class are, at this point, a little beyond the zeroth order stuff presented here. There is little talk of sharing chores, of the domestic work being respected as much as professional work, regardless of which spouse is doing it, there is little talk of pay disparities and the negotiations couples must have about who works and which city one lives in and whose career is best prioritized, how in-laws\' expectations might need to be readjusted according the progressive values the couple might share, about the need to be each other\'s allies while doing that, what the effects of workplace sexism on payscale and advancement are, how simple things like lack of public toilets or streetside harrasment affect women\'s mobility. Brass tacks again! In centering the experience of women around their size, their sex life, their spouse and their snowflakiness, Vogue erases real concerns about how life is lived in India beyond the traditional domestic concerns a woman might have.'

S" The second season of the anime is going to take over a year to come out so I don't think the wait is worth it because the plot moves from sweeping action and war tactics into political intrigue soon after season one ends, which means there's more dialogue-heavy plot, something manga can do as well or better than anime.I started reading the manga immediately after the anime ended and it was worth it. The characters might be slightly differently named or there might be some additional details you'd need to absorb but for the most part, there's not much overhead in switching.The scenes with 3D maneuver gear seem a little less impressive but that's mitigated if you've seen the anime and can extrapolate the full complexity of the movement depicted on paper.I will add though that one can breezily binge through the manga much faster than the anime (it took me a few hours to catch up to the latest) so you will probably end up flooded with names and information and will need a second reading to absorb it all. Otherwise by the time the next monthly installment comes out, you might forget most of it. That's what happened with me."

S' I usually see NRIs of two kinds:Upper middle class with a social circle leaning towards exclusively Indians who selectively enjoy the perks of America but maintain the imagined community of the home country in their private lives. They might be insular or liberal but a common feature is that India is still the main reference point for their worldview, defining everything from the contents of their kitchen shelves to their definition of "national news."Upper middle class with a cosmopolitan social circle that are eager to integrate with the normative white culture. Respectability politics ensures they interact with lower income and black/Latino people minimally and view those people\'s "weird" (I\'m being generous) behavior as a good reason to avoid public transportation and to live in gated communities.The point of the classification being that Indians in America either choose to let the "real America" into their lives very minimally or when they do, they are eager to assimilate with liberal white culture and are averse to engaging with minority cultures (if they do engage, it is only to the extent that they see whites themselves engaging - eating avocados, ordering fish tacos, dancing to rap that white people dance to etc.)Their wealth allows themselves to make either of these two lifestyle choices, and both ensure they never have to empathize much with minorities.The recent case of the old man thrown on his back by Alabama police is illuminating. Not one of the usual Indian enclaves like Jersey or a cosmopolitan city like San Francisco, the geographic location provided for a effective chance for real America to assert itself on the usually blinkered Indian community. While a bitter message was learned, that brown can sometimes be confused for black and treated as badly, a measure of privilege was also recognized and displayed - outrage by Indian American associations led to immediate firings, the Indian government made diplomatic overtures and a Kickstarter gathered many thousands of dollars to pay for the medical bills of the Gujarati grandfather. I\'m not sure what lesson Indian people here took away from it - that desis need to be allies to #BlackLivesMatter and such civil rights causes, or that they need to better educate white people about the differences between their own upstanding gentry and the native troublemakers.And that would be my answer to your question - NRIs are okay with supporting majoritarian parties in India because they generally learn very little from their minority status in the US. They either manage to never feel the downsides of minority status or sublimate it into accidental Islamophobia or accidental anti-black racism which prevents the stinger from attaching to their own group identity.'

S' A Google Scholar/Google News search shows the phrase showing up in geographic contexts of countries such as Nigeria, Congo, Turkey, India, South Africa as well as contexts depending on membership in a social group such as the "epidemics" of campus rape, male rape, child rape etc.It\'s hard to definitively say that application of this term for India is especially unjustified. The word is simply very catchy. American news media tends to be an equal opportunity offender, and India is temporarily getting more of the attention than the rest.I would not directly compare the usage of "rape culture" and "rape epidemic" directly since a) "rape culture" is a holistic 360 feminist theory of social behaviors and mindsets that make sexual violence thrive; while b) "rape epidemic" is more of a numbers game. Put another way, "rape culture" conversations boil down to an ideological debate about how correct feminist thinkers are in diagnosing the causes of rape, while "rape epidemic" conversations are about the data and using to it to best characterize (or mischaracterize, depending on your skin in the game) the symptoms.In the context of the US reporting on India and other foreign countries, the common strain I can spot is that "epidemic" is meant to give the news piece an urgency and sensationalism that can seem clueless to people who\'ve actually grown up and lived in that background being suddenly targeted for coverage.The US media has the power to culturally dominate and define what\'s news and what\'s not, on a global stage. So when they wake up to a long ongoing reality and play catchup by sensationalizing things while also behaving like their coverage finally validates the existence of the problem, local onlookers can end up feeling a bit like those Native tribes people being taught in school that Columbus discovered America - worth a few sighs of exasperation.'

S" There are already various viewpoints on this thread, in favor and against, so I have little new to contribute except to say that there is still the matter of legal procedure and due process that is being overlooked by everyone here. An article in DNA India goes into details here: The problem with 'India's Daughter' is not just the narrative Briefly, the defendant has an ongoing appeals process going and India's Daughter would be a publicly and widely released documentary carrying a dubiously approved and probably extra-judicial confession. The defendant was quite likely not informed about the legal repercussions of this video recording, and it can be contended that it was the State's responsibility to do so since he is in the custody of the State. There is a set and fairly rigid procedure under which a confession may be taken and acted upon in legal proceedings, and if this video were to affect either the defendant's appeals process or the mercy petitions eventually written on his behalf, it can be argued that those set procedures have effectively been bypassed by the State. They get to have their cake and eat it too, violating his right to due process.Making the reasonable assumption that it is unrealistic to expect a firewall between this highly publicized documentary and the officers of the court involved in his case, it would be correct to stop the release of this documentary until his role in the judicial process is complete. I believe in this not just because I'm a stickler for rules and procedures, but I believe that a fair and just legal system that can be relied upon for recourse does far more for creating a safe environment for all its citizens than any change a documentary may or may not bring about."

Crime is a fruitful lens through which to do this because crime can affect any kind of person and the investigation usually immerses the viewer in the victim's unique socio-cultural milieu for the length of the show.To give an example, I remember watching CSI episodes about circus performers, strippers, biker gangs, Deaf people, model train enthusiasts, sci-fi conventioners and so on, and finding the salient details about these lives quite intriguing and worth the time.

S' There\'s a line from a later West Wing episode around the time Bartlet is running for a second term:You say that these numbers mean dial it down. I say they mean dial it up. You haven\'t gotten through. There are people you haven\'t persuaded yet. These number mean dial it up. Otherwise you\'re like the French radical, watching the crowd run by and saying, "There go my people. I must find out where they\'re going so I can lead them."Bartlet is trying to strike a balance between kowtowing to populism and the status quo and advancing the public conversation in America towards his liberal ideas, which is the kind of progress he knows he needs to make to leave a lasting intellectual legacy as President. This is difficult as he is, in his words "a human starting gun." This is why he\'s losing sleep - his inability to come up with a strong, unique brand of leadership that can help affect change. His arc over the course of this episode contrasts neatly with the VP Hoynes\' refusal to play ball with the White House on a tied ethanol vote, and helps highlights the relative incapacities of the President\'s office in taking a principled stand.In the final scene when they\'re on the phone, Bartlet expresses admiration for a past instance in which Hoynes spoke for an unpopular position on ethanol in Iowa, a position he re-asserts during the episode as the White House tries to get him to vote against his position to break the tie.Hoynes, still Presidential hopeful, is getting to sleep at night. Bartlet, actual President, isn\'t. (Compare this with what Josh Lyman once said - the campaign is poetry, governing is prose)'

She also mentioned some bad history with her own alcoholic father. What I got out of this was that her father had been the same kind of "bad" alcoholic that Leo\'s own father had been. On learning Leo\'s history she jumped to a hasty conclusion that he too must have been similarly terrible and is possibly still compromising the integrity of his office.Leo understands that her action came from a place of personal conviction - that a potentially compromised public official should not get to hide his past if his job has important responsibilities. In her talk with him she is clearly awed by the power he has in his office and is taken aback by his upfront, genial and fatherly style.

There was no legal reason to do so, there was no technicality to exploit and convicted persons are usually screened extensively by the Office of the Pardon Attorney for a demonstrated ability to become responsible citizens on return to society, a point featured prominently in a later pardon episode The Benign Prerogative. Nor could the such a plot turn have been shrugged away by the next episode. This Simon Cruz plotline was just about examining the struggle between Bartlet's Catholic beliefs and the demands of his office, a recurring theme for the character."

S' Could there BE anything cooler than the idea of a BasqueIcelandic pidgin?In roughly the 17th century, as the Basques were exploring the Atlantic for fishing opportunities, they found their way to Iceland, another place where they had no common language. Actually, the Basque-Icelandic pidgin is a complex mix of a number of languages that these two disparate groups of people used to communicate. Interestingly, the Icelanders documented this pidgin and the Basque-Icelandic glossaries are now online for all to browse.Apparently, the Basques had a long history in Iceland, essentially competing with the locals for fishing resources. This lead to a number of violent encounters. This incident, again from Wikipedia but originally described by Jn Gumundsson the learned, gives a flavor for what kind of things were going on:In the 17th and 18th centuries Basque whalers hunted in Icelandic waters. Despite any mutually beneficial results, in 1615, a crew of 32 shipwrecked and stranded Basques were executed by Icelanders. Jn Gumundsson condemned the local sheriff for this decision in his account of the event. The glossary has a number of colorful phrases. Let me just mention one. In a recent paper by Viola Giulia Miglio, Dr. Miglio reanalyzes the glossary and points out a phrase that had previously eluded translation. The phrase is Sickutta Samaria  serda merina. The meaning of the second phrase, Icelandic, had been clear  defile the mare  but the Basque had not been translated. Dr. Miglio proposes the first word is xikotu and that the phrase, in a more polite translation, means go shag a horse. Sailors have always had a reputation for colorful language and Basque sailors are no exception.From: The Basque-Icelandic Pidgin'

S" Great answers here. One other point I would add is that movie critics have seen a lot more movies than the average movie-goer, even most cinephiles. Not only is their depth of experience with film greater, but also they've consciously worked on widening their palette to appreciate films of diverse and international genres and film traditions. This places them in the unique position of being able to connect the dots and see a bigger picture (no pun intended) which they share with interested audiences through their writing.Here's a couple of examples - Rome, Open City (Roberto Rossellini, 1945),  La Dolce Vita (Federico Fellini, 1960), and  La Grande Bellezza (Paolo Sorrentino, 2013) are three Italian films by different directors set in different decades and filmed in different styles. But what movie critics see is that the three films each manage to capture particular, temporary, and very compelling moments in the cultural history of Rome, and taken together form a historical trilogy of sorts; On a similar note, Persona (Ingmar Bergman, 1966), 3 Women (Robert Altman, 1977), and Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001) form a triptych on the common theme of feminine identity.Being able to illuminate this meta-narrative for the benefit of filmgoers who can't spend the same amount of time on casual entertainment, is one of the most unique services a film critic can provide. Critics can frame the context around a particular actor's current film role based on his career arc in the past (eg. how Adam Sandler's early comedies inform his role in the stylish romantic drama Punch-Drunk Love). They can explain how a director's technique is evolving over time, what traditions he used to be enamored with in his early days (Wes Anderson and the French New Wave) and what new influences he seems to be channeling now (Stefan Zweig in Budapest Hotel) and how they're affecting his style.Critics can also connect a cinematic legacy with a historical legacy, cutting across different styles and personalities. For example, in his book, Film After Film: (Or, What Became of 21st Century Cinema?), Village Voice critic J Hoberman collects his numerous review columns and commentaries published over the course of the 2000s and wonderfully relates them to the heightened events after 9/11 and the mindset of the post 9/11 American zeitgeist in both the general populace and the film industry. By prefixing fresh new commentaries before each older piece, a large part of the book turns into one long examination of the Bush and early Obama years and their reflection and impact on the popular films of the time. This is the kind of expansive, panoramic view of an art form that only critics can provide.Bad critics can tend to view their insights as little baubles to be coveted and teasingly flashed to readers in order to impress them, or just as references to be understood by their colleagues and uber-viewers who are in-the-know. Good critics can distill and COMMUNICATE these ideas to encourage a viewer to take up challenging films or find salvageable objects of interest in movies otherwise dismissable as trash."

S" The part that gets me about that episode is the bluntness with which Leo told his wife that for these few years, yes, his job is more important than his marriage. Its function is to set up early on the conviction by which he and the staffers live their lives. Everyone has a sense that in those 4/8 years, they will get a once in a lifetime chance to do something special. As the episodes go by, characters sometimes lose sight or forget but they always come back to this.Leo did not try to negotiate or say something less than what he meant. Idealism sounds great when it's fiery rhetoric but it takes a quiet scene where the rubber hits the road to show that he actually believes it."

S' This is not addressed in the episode exactly, but the Indonesian leader (Sugardo) in the episode seems to be clearly modeled on Suharto, the controversial Indonesian President who held office from \'67 to \'98.At the time the episode was written, Suharto would have been very recently ousted from a 31 year long stint in power marked towards the end by violence, nepotism, corruption and pandering to Islamism, so the references to political oppression are timely and appropriate. (*)That bring us to the state dinner and what Indonesia did to deserve it. Throughout the Cold War, Indonesia was publicly neutral but privately aligned with the US. Suharto had a strong anti-Communist agenda and the Russians even had an arms embargo against the country. So there are at least a few decades of positive foreign policy relations behind the scenes there. Indonesia was also a founding member of the regional collective ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). It also keeps bearing in mind that Indonesia grew massively under Suharto to become a strong regional power and given how close it is to China, the US and Indonesia have good reasons to continue to cooperate, specifically on their mutual goal of containing China\'s influence. (**)To sum it up, Indonesia\'s past and (then) present alignments on foreign policy probably helped ensure that their President got a state dinner. The only confusing bit is that if you go by the year the episode is set in, President "Sugardo" should already have been thrown out of office.(*) - I\'ll regard Donna\'s throwaway line "they summarily execute people they suspect of being sorcerers" as a bit of dime-store orientalism.(**) - For a post 9/11 episode, there would be the additional factor that Indonesia has the world\'s largest population of Muslim people, a population that is tolerant and pluralistic, and that holding up such a role model is just good diplomacy for an America trying to promote democracy in the Middle East.'

S' Cult is not a genre any more than box-office flops are a genre.Cult as a concept is circumscribed by the following ideas:Commercial earnings: a financially successful movie is disqualified from being a cult hit by definition. The number of average filmgoers unaware of the movie counts towards its bonafides.Aesthetic considerations: something judged to be too ahead of its time or too odd to pigeonhole helps make it a cult filmPersona: if a director or actor maintains a select but ardent following through a unique public image and personal vision, middling films of theirs can be reevaluated as cult filmsRetroactive nominations: throwaway fare from a bygone era and often possessing a sensibility naive by contemporary standards is sometimes "rediscovered" for its ironic pleasures and deemed to be a cult object.Foreign films that receive a modest screening in a home country by some fortunate accident; mediocre domestic films that are syndicated on national television and catch on -- all stand a chance of becoming cult films.Quentin Tarantino has watched a wide array of films and his knowledge of various film traditions is superlative. His own films draw from many such traditions, examples being the sphagetti western, the samurai subgenre of Jidaigeki, Hong Kong kung fu, Blaxploitation and many others.His own status as cult figure is questionable past the time of Pulp Fiction\'s release. Of his films, Reservoir Dogs can perhaps still claim to be merely a cult film. Right now though, he is way too well known for any of his films to enter the cult canon.'

S" While issue boils down to consent and necessity, the answer to this question depends on the exact situation.First, establishing the following as facts: Sexual intercourse is not a necessity but food and nutrition is.Both cases, bestiality and killing an animal for food, occur without the consent of the animal.Any unnecessary killing of sufficiently advanced animals (a class that includes cows and other livestock) is morally wrong.Proceeding from here, we take up the case of most western countries which have the plentiful availability of vegetarian food options that makes eating meat unnecessary. In such societies, if people are okay with non-consensually killing animals but not okay with non-consensually having sex with them, then that's a clear double standard.In however, say, a remote Inuit settlement that is critically dependent on hunting for survival, it would not be a double standard for them to eat meat and yet keep bestiality outlawed. The non-consensual killing would be necessary and hence not a moral wrong while the bestiality (non-consensual by definition) would still be wrong since it cannot be a necessity."

S' Yes, the best primer on this is a 2013 investigation by The Hollywood Reporter (Animals Were Harmed: Hollywood\'s Nightmare of Death, Injury, and Secrecy Exposed | Hollywood Reporter Exclusive) that details several disturbing incidents that occurred during various film projects:Flicka: Ferber is not surprised by the allegation that the AHA is failing to adequately monitor many productions. When he attempted in 2005 to investigate two horse deaths during production of Foxs Flicka (based on the beloved childrens novel), he says the AHAs Film & TV Unit management insisted the deaths on the sets in the Simi and San Fernando valleys were unpreventable accidents. When he dispatched L.A. Animal Control officers to talk to the AHA, They told animal control to f themselves, he says. This is worse than doing nothing. This is like a cop not just ignoring a crime but helping cover it up.The end credit AHA ultimately bestowed on Flicka reads, without elaboration, American Humane Association monitored the animal action.Love\'s Everlasting Courage:a horse named Glass  known for his gentle demeanor, one blue eye and a distinctive white blaze of mane set against a shimmering black coat  was fatally injured when a runaway wagon really did lose control and the carriages crossbar broke (think of a pencil snapping), impaling the animals left hindquarter. He then went into shock from extreme blood loss and the vet decided it would be more humane to euthanize him than allow him to suffer, according to an internal AHA report.War Horse (film):Casey also alleges in her filing that in order to protect Steven Spielberg, one of the most notable and influential persons in the history of film, and because of the volume of press and other publicity this film garnered, AHA agreed to cover up the death of [a] horse [onWar Horse] and to give the 2011 film its No Animals Were Harmed end credit.The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian:On Disneys The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, horses were repeatedly pulled for injuries  internal AHA notes from a single day show that 14 were out of commission at once. Yet it received the "No Animals Were Harmed" credit because, the organization now explains, none of the injuries were serious or due to intentional harm.There Will Be Blood: On There Will Be Blood, from Paramount Vantage, multiple horses died, including a couple from colic, which often is triggered by heatstroke. (Nine days before they died on June15, 2006, the AHA rep on set in Texas received an anonymous complaint that it is a very dry, hot, dusty and windy day, and the horses are not getting water.)Additionally:It concluded that 82 horses had been adversely affected while working on sets during this period  ranging from The Alamo to Hidalgo, Flicka to 3:10 to Yuma  with 58 injuries and eight deaths (collision with camera car, stepped on lead rope, impalement). Such extensive, transparent details about the reality of the on-set animal toll never have been shared with the public.'

S' All right, this thread seems a tad underserved.God & CapitalismUpstream Color by Shane Carruth - Mr. Carruth\'s sophomore effort is a shift from the circular time-loops of Primer to the elliptical visuals of mind-controlling worms and perilously blue orchids juxtaposed with the lives of two victims of a senseless ransacking of their lives, a trauma which connects as well as pulls them apart. To call it just an allegory of about higher powers and systems of economics would be unfair because it can be read as an allegory of depression or addiction, among many other possibilities. If one were to be inclined to distill these various interpretations to their quintessence - in modern life, the thing that fucks you up and the thing that\'s trying to fix your life afterwards are often in cahoots. Not getting into such barebones though, the allegorical interpretation that makes most sense to me is that Upstream Color is about Capitalism (the "Thief" in the movie) --- in the sense of a process that you cannot help but participate in (The "Thief" literally controls the bodies of his victims and forces them to perform idiosyncratic tasks for days before emptying their bank accounts and discarding them) --- dovetailing itself with a Higher Deity (The "Sampler" in the movie, who later beckons victims of the "Thief" and removes the mind-control worm from the body), to ensure that a cycle of fear, dependence and violence perpetuates itself, to the profit of both parties.There Will Be Blood by Paul Thomas Anderson - There Will Be Blood is the sort of movie begging to be called a saga. The movie charts Daniel Plainview\'s rise to the apex of the oil business and transform into a frankly terrifying titan of American-brand frontier capitalism, while Paul Dano in a breakout role as Eli Sunday is constant fly in the ointment as a preacher of a local community who senses in Daniel Plainview\'s ambition, an opportunity to parlay the fervor of his community\'s faith into a piece of the Plainview pie. Over a gripping two and a half hour hours, what ensues is an allegorical struggle between capitalism and religion. Interpreting them as such leads one to conclude that Mr. Anderson considers both ideas locked in an internecine conflict over the human soul, despising and wishing to crush the other, jealous and contemptuous by turns of the unique power that the other wields. How the end plays out for you depends heavily on the depths of your feelings about milkshakes.Femininity3 Women by Robert Altman - The context to know about 3 Women is that the entire movie is based off a dream Mr. Altman had while his wife was in the hospital. In a stunt unthinkable today, he pitched his "dream" to studio executives and produced 3 Women, a fable western where the women play russian roulette with feminine archetypes. The story is of Pinky, Millie and Willie - Pinky is a young woman of inane conversations of vapid interests, who finds a job at a health spa out west and ends up enamored of Millie, who is as grown up as she is not taken seriously at all. She considers herself a modern woman, with an apartment and a variety of consumer goods purchased by her hard-won salary, but who is ignored by men, as her flirtatious forays often ring false and her personality comes off as superficial. In this mix, is a mysterious third woman named Willie who is pregnant and spends her days tending a local saloon and painting vast murals of chaotic, demonic looking figures -- the stuff of myth -- in scenes of lust and violence and general catastrophe. Over the course of the movie, Pinky grows up and begins to behave more like a young woman akin to Millie, which threatens Millie because she\'s better at it that Millie herself, who is compelled to shift roles up from a wannabe cocquette to a parental figure, burned and grieved by the actions of the child. Imagery signifying menarche (spilled ketchup on an apron) marks such transitional points and eventually there is another exchange of roles towards an final synthesis of personalities. What I find interesting about this movie is that despite its professed origins as a dream, with all the lack of logic inherent, the plot tends itself easily to an allegorical reading of women in different stages of female life, growing up, regressing, trading places. Willie, the one woman comfortable in her own skin, is involved in a crisis at the end of the film that leads to a final scene of seeming resolution - three woman living communally, perhaps all three roles and minds and bodies now merged into one. Men, lurking at the edges or otherwise bodily aggressors throughout, have been eliminated from this collective. The final scene is the Mr. Altman\'s comment on how he imagines this would play out.Under the Skin (2013 film) by Jonathan Glazer - The obtuse visuals and lack of exposition in Under The Skin throw off attempts to neatly consider it an allegory about so-and-so, but it is definitely allegorizing something. Playing an alien that has assumed the form of an attractive woman and tasked with hunting and consuming men across Scotland, Scarlett Johannson\'s character conducts her hunt with persistence and diligence. The conversations are spontaneous, the intentions of sex are effortlessly conveyed and the final moments of disrobing and approach play out in a hermetic mindspace and are intensely choreographed. With the eerie score pulsing through the final moments of each victim\'s life, the suggestion is one ritualized interplay, "kabuki theater" is the phrase that came to my mind as I first watched it. What does this movie say about the relationships between men and women, the buying and selling of sex, the pratfalls and predicaments of being a very successful sex object, the original sin of growing a heart and going under the skin? It\'s all rather slippery for me to say with certitude but I would still say this movie is a great one to think about.Man vs. Nature/ The Meaning of LifeThe Woman in the Dunes by Hiroshi Teshigahara - Based on the novel of the same name by Japanese writer Kobo Abe, this is a story of amateur entomologist on a weekend excursion to a remote area of Japan near the sea, on the hunt for beetles indigenous to the sandy dunes of the region. There is a small village, the only outpost of mankind for leagues, whose denizens share a cruel secret. When forced to spend the night with them, Junpei Niki is led by the villagers to the hospitality of a woman living in a house built inside a sand quarry. Lowered down by rope ladder and offered food and care by the woman inside, he settles down to sleep through the first of many years worth of nights in that house. For the hospitality was a ruse - the villagers have assigned the woman, and now him, the Sisyphean task of endlessly digging up sand and piling it into the waiting buckets of the villagers above. The job is both menial and life-threatening. The sand becomes the third character in this two-person drama as it is their only resource - they need to keep working to receive food and water from the village -- while also being a all-consuming force of nature, violating their house, their food, their bodies, and needing constant effort to clean up after and beat back. Junpei initially resists this forced enslavement, but the sand is unclimbable, unstoppable, and starts eroding his dignity as well as his possessions if he even tries to force the villager\'s hand by not working. As days become weeks, the woman he now shares this fate with becomes sensually appealing and an understanding emerges. Months pass as escape attempts fail and help from Tokyo fails to materialize. Indeed there is no sign that anyone seems to know he\'s missing. By chance he discovers a way to condense water from the damp sand and starts obsessively perfecting his technology. At the end of the movie, a viable chance to escape presents itself but Junpei decides he can stay a while longer, because he knows he can make a yet better water condenser. A final image from the scene informs us that Junpei has been missing for over seven years. As becomes clear over the course of the story, Woman in the Dunes is a sometimes-harrowing allegory about life, what we consider to be meaningful, and how oppressive agents and forces of nature beyond our control shape our destiny. While this may sound quite disheartening, the movie offers us at the end a vision for hope - offered freedom from his prison, Junpei rejects it for a chance to keep working on the novel device he discovered. The movie suggests that even in the bleakest of life situations, a man can find a thing to own, to work upon, to improve and master, and such meaningful accomplishment can feed the soul more than the hustle and bustle of modern city life with the usual social relationships can. Amid the dust motes of that intolerable sand, Junpei discovers a universe far bigger than the stars of the night sky.Walkabout (film) by Nicholas Roeg - After a middle-aged man with some issues goes nutso and starts shooting at his his son and daughter during a picnic in the Australian outback before killing himself and destroying their car, the two siblings are forced into the desert wilderness with limited food and water, searching for civilization. Visits to an oasis provide temporary respite but the hostility of the insects and assorted critters waiting for them to stop moving is constant. They meet an aboriginal boy who takes them on an adventure through his home terrain. A makeshift family of three forms with a budding romance between the girl and the aboriginal adolescent. It is not to last however, but there is much beauty and loss before their adventure ends and they return to their familiar suburban life. Walkabout is a primarily visual adventure that sets up dichotomies between sterile civilized life and the untamed excitement of the outback. The characters are all unnamed and assumed to be archetypes and what plays out is an allegorical story of the tensions between nature and society, the comical futility of attempting to tame nature, the misadventures stemming from a failure to communicate and how one can recapture the innocence of Eden, albeit briefly, when mandates of society are ignorable.'

S' I think what Todd Gardiner said is quite true but after conditioning for that fact and playing a little loose with the term "small-scale", certain specific answers can be given to this question. My nomination would be Fellini.The contrast between his earlier films like I Vitelloni, La Strada, Il Bidone and Nights of Cabiria and his most famous signature films such as La Dolce Vita, Otto e Mezzo, and Amarcord speaks to exactly the kind of shift you\'re talking about.Fellini started work in the traditions of Italian neo-realism, working with Roberto Rossellini who was firmly embedded in that style. His early films are similarly realist takes on life in post-war Italy, bleak and life-affirming in turns though with a bent towards the former. There is a sympathetic yet honest look at the problems and prospects of the lower frequencies of life as represented by buskers, vagrants, delinquent youth, prostitutes and con-men.Some sample visuals:His later films were marked by the introduction of a more carnivalesque atmosphere and a surreal poetry to the visuals of his films. There had been the merest hints of this in his earliest films, such as a brief raucous party in I Vitelloni that shows us glimpses of such visuals as:but it was not to be after encounters with the theories of Carl Jung and the I Ching, several encounters with clinical depression and a case of "writer\'s block", that a different and more unique vision expressed itself:'

S' One aspect not mentioned so far is that magical realism has a politics associated with it that surrealism does not.Incubated in Latin America, and adopted in places like the Indian subcontinent and Eastern Europe, magical realism has historically tried to dilate reality to highlight what is bizarre - and specifically - unjust about those societies. Think issues of class, race and colonialism.Surrealism is not quite so political, or rather tends to embody a more personal struggle against restrictive social structures and a revolt against conventional thinking and logic.While magical realism has been used by writers in diagnosing maladies in their culture, surrealism, insofar as it was used to advance a politics, was used in a more prescriptive sense as a way for art to support the values of anarchism and communism.'

That\'s good TV right there.I think also that National Anthem aspired at broader commentary compared with the focused studies on death, memory or justice, that characterize the later episodes. National Anthem has themes of geo-political terrorism, masculinity in crisis, family melodrama, authenticity in film, social media and performance art. It really tries to check a lot of boxes, if you think about it. And that\'s a good way to appeal to a lot of different interests that people have.'

S' A2AWith due respect to Stephanie Vardavas\' answer, I find her strategies to be heavily contingent on a majority or even a plurality of one\'s friends having the sort of good tastes you\'re having trouble discovering currently. My experience has not been like that so I prefer a measure of independence in discovery.My advice would be to try and enter the cultural conversation going on online. Vibrant communities exist that are passionate about every genre of fiction you might be interested in. I\'m a literary fiction person and I actually do prefer contemporary books to older classics, so I started out by reading up the recent Pulitzer and Booker winners, and discovering sites that review their works or comment upon them in some form. To give you an example, The Millions and Flavorwire are two websites I could give the gold seal of personal approval to for book recommendations. They have tons of lists, essays and other commentary to help you get the flavor of the author, and most importantly, feel part of a cultural conversation of worth if none in your social circle are aware of these authors. Which is the goal you indicated with your Murakami quote, right?If you\'ll allow me to go on for a bit - that quote you cited has always been a bit of a brainsnare for me. I think about how it\'s true but at the same time it\'s undercut but how there are levels to the whole thing. I know some crappy books (Coelho etc.) that everyone I know has read. I think about this quote and feel better about myself because I\'ve avoided ever getting into them. But then if I focus a little closer to my subset of literary type friends, we all  are cool about hating him and we all love the actually profound and beautiful writers, guys like Murakami in fact. But then this quote starts to bug me again, and I think - oh okay, I\'m slightly better than the rest of my friends because I\'ve read Jonathan Franzen, unlike everybody else I know (context: talking about Indian friends). But then I go online, to Flavorwire perhaps, and learn that reading Franzen is such a WASP cliche and that he\'s been on the cover of effin\' TIME magazine (elite among the hallowed world of dentist waiting room periodicals) and that sticks a rod up my high horse and I\'m back online searching for something absolutely no one would have got to yet, and before you know it, it\'s 3 a.m. and I\'m on a Tumblr page called "Writers No One Reads" and I skeptically scroll through and all I\'m thinking is - "Jeez, this looks fun...NOT."So I guess what I\'m trying to say here is while that quote has some wisdom in it, there\'re some serious nausea inducing whirligigs involved when you factor in the diverse, fractured and intersecting social contexts, both real and virtual, in which we all operate. And when you\'ve been in the merry-go-round long enough, it all starts to come around and before you know it you\'re considering a hipsterish contrarian reading of The Alchemist.Again, all of which is all to say... best of luck!'

S" Journalism is not dead. And Buzzfeed is not, I repeat for emphasis, NOT crap.If you haven't taken a moment to scratch the surface and actually measure the quality of Buzzfeed's reporting for yourself, please take a moment now to do so. Their longform journalism is pretty great. Some big names from older generations of media have made their home at Buzzfeed and the site is giving them the space and platform to write great stories.See links here for more: American Journalism Review, CUNY Graduate School of Journalism - CUNY Graduate School of Journalism , Three lists about BuzzFeeds serious journalismThey have some ways to go still but it is clear that Buzzfeed's business model is actually working (=making money), which makes it a rarity in the current media climate. Memes and quirky quizzes sell and Buzzfeed is using those revenues to subsidize the creation of great journalism. If that's what it takes to keep journalism alive then bring on the quizzes.Another point in favor of Buzzfeed would be its notable progressive values in giving women, trans-people, and people-of-color a front and center voice. No other journalistic institution of comparable visibility comes close in matching Buzzfeed in the racial, gender and sexual diversity of voices it encourages and targets content towards.Among old media, a very chosen few will have the distinguished status and loyal consumer base to put up paid subscription models, have somber intellectualism as their metier, and still continue to remain in the black."

That is to say, I picture them cheerily agreeing to the most obvious objectives of feminism ("They should be able to get jobs!"

S" I used to be a beauty therapist, with a specialty in aromatherapy. Aromatherapy is about getting the benefits of essential oils into your system. The usual ways of doing this is via inhalation or massage. Generally you cannot charge much for asking people to sniff some oils so when booking 'aromatherapy' in most spas you can expect a massage with essential oils. First I would sit down with a client and have a short chat about what they were looking for, the usual thing is people want to relax and destress. Sometimes they might specify that they need more energy. I'd blend a few oils that I thought would work well for them, which would become the fragrance for the massage oil. The massage I did was normally just using basic Swedish massage techniques which I would customise depending on the type of treatment they had requested. So if they had requested a relaxing treatment I would increase the amount of Effleurage and Petrissage, For a more energising massage I'd increase the Tapotement and Friction in the massage. I would also spend sometime wafting the essential oils in front of their nose - this is the inhalation part that I spoke of earlier. I will make a confession, I think nearly every massage I have ever done, left the person being massaged asleep after about 20-30 minutes. It didn't matter how energising I tried to make it. "

S' I worked for global HR consultancy and for four years I was the proposal writer for their Talent and Rewards segment (making some contributions to the Benefits segment). Proposals came in many shapes and forms and I worked mostly in formal bid procedures, responding to RFPs (request for proposals), RFIs (request for information) and pitch documents. I think these are the 5 prime challenges that I found with most proposals I worked on. Limited time and resources. Deadlines are always short, there have been times weve had two days to write a 30 page proposal to a company and other clients are never understanding. In fairness, for that particular example we were actually given one month by the client, for some reason no one actually thought to start on it except two days before, because you know, impossible deadlines are fun. Even when you are given a lot more notice, it is hard to convince people to give up billable hours for a proposal that may or may not be won, and as for getting the senior directors times is even more difficult.Not knowing what the client wants. In large companies RFPs are put together by a procurement team. They have a lot of questions about your company  lots and lots, but sometimes they do have a tinsey winsey problem actually telling you what products or services theyre asking for. Ive gone through 20 page documents like theyre a Wheres Wally book looking for the key information  yep there it is on page 17, sub-section 12, item iv This is what we want, Sometimes the title is a clue RFP for the provision of talent management services. Terrific and what do you think that means oh client dear? And when you are told, it doesnt matter, because the consultant Id be working with already has it in his head what he is going to sell you. Yeah I know you didnt ask for that, but he really really wants to give you that product. My job would be to just convince him to also mention what theyve actually specified  in sub-section 15.Not knowing the specifics of what the client wants. So your client wants a holiday, but where to, for how long, sunny or snowy, how many other people are going? Oh youre not going to say  you want us to guess. Smart, because we cant really give you a price without this information but youve stipulated that costings must be provided and the deadline for questions has now passed and the bloody consultant who was supposed to ask you this information for some reason didnt and now were petrified of over-pricing ourselves. With this situation you just have to make a lot of assumptions, but you dont want to over-price based on those assumptions, so you price for a core product or service, you can add an extra section for other services and you make sure it is clearly scoped what this would include.Bizarre, seemingly irrelevant questions. Some of the questions asked by a company are about due diligence could be extremely broad and generic in order to cater for all vendors. Ive had to answer the most bizarre questions that have nothing to do the product. They are there to ascertain how safe your company is to be their supplier. What makes you safe is very broad, from your ethics policy to how many deaths happen globally in your company.Making it interesting to read. You cant just plonk a 60 page document on someones desk and hope theyre not too busy to read your dry text on just how great your product is. Sure they asked for it, but unless it is interesting to read theyre just going to skim it and you risk your message being lost. One of the things that I felt was really important is to make as much as possible visual. A lot of information can be conveyed in infographics that can be viewed in an instant. It is an extremely efficient way to convey information and this had the advantage of breaking up text into more manageable sections. '

S' I used to work in Sales and Marketing for a French cosmetics company called Bourjois.New product launches could be categorised as follows: New product range: This would be an entire new range of a product for example lipsticks. The lipsticks would have a new formula with at least one specific feature, e.g. moisturising or long-lasting, the packaging would be new and the range of colours would be new. New formula: Much less frequently the formula of a popular product would be upgraded. This is not that common and is only done when the brand of that product still has value, normally it is preferable to just create a new product. New introduction: Kind of like the new product range, but one that already exists in other markets. We sold a much larger range of products in France than we did in the UK. New colours: Colours are discontinued and added to all the time. There are several factors involved in the rationale of these. These new products would generally coincide with our promotion cycle which was every two months. We would launch extra colours off-cycle, but generally they would eventually get on the promotion cycle. Having said that not every promotion cycle had new products. Generally a new product line would be added a couple of times of year, but this wasnt a fixed number. New colours were introduced more often. No fixed amount and I never counted but most promotion cycles had a few new colours. These promotion cycles were based on the promotion cycles of Boots a significant customer for all the budget to mid-priced cosmetics companies and we all followed this cycle, with a similar pattern of promotion.

They have had other influences since then, but we have kept that association with the Celts.To me the land and nature of Galicia is very different from that of Andalucia or Valencia which have the culture that is more likely to be associated with Spain by tourists. With regards to looks I would say many Galicians have fairer skin than the average Spanish deep olive, we even have natural redheaded Galicians, and credit is given to the Celtic heritage.

S' In most offices you know where you will be sitting every day, it will be a desk that is allocated to you and you know that until youre told to move, you can go to that desk every day. In most offices they will allow you to even personalise your desk area to some degree. Hot-desking is when an office doesnt allocate desks for its employees and you will be expected to use a different desk on a regular basis. Any personal items or work related items that you regularly reference will be stored in a separate area, usually some kind of cabinet or drawer. Sometimes these can be wheeled to the desk youre using that day. Very often laptops are supplied, but this isnt essential for hot-desking as long as desktops are set up for multiple user logins from the network. Pros (some perceived some real)Saves money. Hot-desking is popular in companies with a large number of consultants, as consultants frequently work away from the office on client sites or they work from home, so large savings can be made by having less desks than employees. Consultancies like to maintain nice head offices in the centre of their capital cities, and this will be expensive in cities like London. Having to make space for hundreds of consultants that are rarely in the office seems like an expense that can be spared.Creativity. The first company that I worked for that had hot-desking was a management consultancy. I was working as a Graphics Specialist and had an allocated seat, but the consultants didnt. The official line was that hot-desking was proved to increase creativity. Youre forced out of your routine by sitting near other people. Im not sure if this really works out in reality though.Exposure to different people  widening the employee network. The idea is that employees will end up mixing it up and sitting next to different people most days. Heads of departments will be sitting next to interns. Everyone will be learning off everyone. In reality this is just something to reassure people that this will be a good move, but not how it actually ends up working. ConsPeople tend not to like it. Were territorial creatures and we like our special mug, the photo of our family. We like our printouts of documents, even if theyre all easily accessible online. We all want our small corner of world we can call our own.Possessiveness.There are people who continue to feel territorial over a desk and do their best to make sure they always use the same one. If anyone should get their desk for a day they will do their best to make that person feel uncomfortable so that they dont do it again. This leads to other people resenting that someone has acquired a permanent desk.Inefficiencies of working. Some people need to work collaboratively, yet dont want to make any more effort than spinning their chair around to talk to their co-worker. Even if theyre willing to get up, in a large office this may mean it takes 5 minutes just to go visit your colleague on another floor. Not efficient if you have to work closely on a project. These can be overcome, but require forethought and planning. Consultants who may be on various projects, which means various teams, may find this harder to plan for.Less visibility. More flexibility on working from home is usually necessary when reducing desk numbers. This in itself is not a problem, but most companies would like employees to pay regular visits to the office. This is harder to insist upon and enforce if youre not sure where your team is.How does it work? There are many systems for hot-desking and there are companies that charge money for implementing these systems, but they are mainly based on two themes.Free for all. Pretty simple - first come first served, just walk in and pick your desk. The early birds will get their preferred desk, maybe something to put in the pro list for employers. This system doesnt cost money and works if you have enough seats for most employees. The less employees you have, the better the ratio needs to be for desks to employees. However if you have a large number of employees it is less risky to assume that not everyone will be in every day and still everyone will get a desk.Booking system. The typical system is to have an electronic system where you book your desk in advance. This guarantees that you will get a desk when you go to work, or you know not to go in. What tends to happen is that people book the same desk for weeks in advance, regardless of whether they are 100% sure they need it. The better system has some way of releasing your desk if you dont use your desk by a certain period, so that someone else can use it. It means teams can book seats next to each other as well. My last company tells me the even have a phone app to book and cancel desks as well. In very large companies, where they have a relatively low ratio of desks to employees, they may also have a mix of these systems, where there is a booking in system, but there is also an area of unallocated desks that you can just sit in, whilst waiting for a desk to be allocated.Overall though, people do get used to this system, even though from the employee perspective it isnt ideal, it doesnt seem to cause any real issues.'

S" I think the makers of the more expensive quality brands would argue that their products are better quality and will take longer before they chip and/or peel. For myself personally, I don't make a distinction between price but I do think there are distinct quality differences. Sometimes quality does come at a great price, but yes generally quality costs. The majority of price difference can be put down to packaging and brand, however there a few discernible differences to the more quality brands compared to budget brands that actually affect the product: BrushCheap brands often have long, thin, brush that doesn't apply the product well. The brush 'hairs' will often spread and this means application is harder. You will find that it is harder to paint a neat line near your cuticleQuality brands often have a good quality brush that makes it easier to paint an easy line near your cuticle. No stray hairs make it neater to use. Some brands even shape the brush to make it really easyThe product on the left is from Sally Hansen and cost about twice the product on the right which is from Rimmel. Consistency Get a sheet of white paper, paint a little strip of colour. The more quality products will tend to be smoother and more consistent in application. Top strip is from Rimmel (the cheapest), the second strip is the next price up (Sally Hansen) and the bottom is the most expensive (Nails Inc). ColourNormally the pigment will be better and there may be more of it, which makes the colour more intense, in the more expensive brands. This agains helps with consistency.Although I do notice these differences, I do think they are marginal though. If I liked the colour I'd happily buy the cheaper brand and I think Rimmel is actually great value. I also think with nail polishes if you like to have range of colours then go for the cheaper ones as they all have a limited shelf life and the more use them and the longer you keep them the more separated the colour becomes and you just get clearish gunk at the top of the bottle.

S" The advice here is conventional wisdom that we'll often hear, particularly when starting out in our career. I don't want to say that it is bad per se, but just that there are times when not following it, did work well for me. Dont lie on your CV or interviewThis is the main one were told right. Never lie, youll be caught out and bad things will happen to you and even if youve worked for the company for 20 years, should they find a single mistake in your CV you can say goodbye to your job. Well it is probably true there is no point lying about the big stuff, but there is one area that I have told some little fibs on and that is when it comes to what software I know how to use. To be fair Ive never intentionally and knowing lied about this, but when I was a lot younger and confidently ignorant of the world I used to forget that I didnt actually know everything. The thing is recruiters and HR people need to have as much quantifiable criteria as possible. For them being able to tick the list of software skills needed on their candidate list is a great thing to go back to a head of department with. Yet in reality software is changing all the time, the true skill needed is someone who can pick new software quickly, there have been several occasions when Ive been asked if knew software x when going for graphics/DTP roles. People immediately look nervous if you say you dont know it, yet I knew I had the true skill needed, which is that I can learn these things on the job very very quickly, soooooo I may have gone ahead on just a few occasions and said that I had used the software, when technically I hadn't. No one ever knew or suspected, although I would later own up to colleagues  normally just to reassure them when they were nervous about not knowing a very specific skill that someone had decided was critical.Dont change jobs too much early onThe one piece of advice I was given over and over when I was young, was dont change jobs. You need to stay in your first job at least two to three years. I didnt. If I didnt like a job Id leave it and when youre young the chances are youre not going to like a lot of the jobs you go for. There was a point though that I started to get very nervous about how my CV looked. Being told to keep it to one page was a joke with the amount of entries I had. Then I applied for a graphics job with a Management Consultancy, they looked at my CV and looked at me and said so youve had a lot jobs. Indeed I had. They then proceeded to tell me how all that variety must mean Im a very flexible and adaptable person and was seen as a real asset in their company. It was true as well and from that point I realised that despite the conventional wisdom my job changing could be seen as a real positive. I dont know if they still give the advice of staying with your first job for two years, but ignore it if they do. Dont make wavesWho wants someone causing trouble for their department, right? Certainly no one in any of the blue chip companies Ive ever worked with. I was working for one company when we merged with another. I was really shocked by their extremely long-winded way of representing data they produced for infographics, it was a combination of copying and pasting screen shots and retyping data. Although they created beautiful outputs, the error rate was appalling. My boss said not to worry about them and to not mention my ideas, just do it their way. I was genuinely shocked that she was encouraging this extremely inefficient and costly method because she just didn't want to have an awkward conversation. It was a source of great frustration that I had to leave them to it. One day I heard about one of their projects for their most demanding client. They told me what they had committed to, some very fancy data heavy infographics, that were completely different from the information they usually represented. As it stood they would have had to input the data in a different order for every chart. They had much less time than usual, yet to do things their way they needed to double the time needed and double their resources. Neither of which was possible. My boss had long since left so I felt free to tell them they were all crazy people and there was no possible way they could go on as they thought and I was going to create some tools for them to save them - I wish I could say I used much better words than that, but they were probably worse. I really needed to get them to understand they couldn't do things their way any more and they needed to understand that immediately. Luckily one of the team members knew enough about excel to realise I made sense and we collaborated. Long story short, I forced them to change and do things my way and our department came in on time, the data we gave was the most accurate ever and best of all I saved them 11,000. And of course that's what counts in the end."

S' Jeremy Corbyn is currently causing controversy with suggestions put forward that there should be women only train carriages so that they are protected by harassment, with many people feeling that this is taking us back 25 years. This must feel like a real own goal for something that had such good intentions. It was part of a list of suggestions to combat the issue of street harassment for women in the UK and it important issue that needs to be tackled. However he has shown a real lack of understanding in womens issues to think that segregation is progress in the fight against harassment. He says It is simply unacceptable that many women and girls adapt their daily lives in order to avoid being harassed on the street, public transport and in other public places from the park to the supermarket. Yet doesnt seem to understand that this is still adapting our daily lives to avoid harassment, regardless of the effort it takes.The problem is protecting women in this way seems intuitively to make sense, just like telling them not to go out late at night and to wear demure clothing. It however reinforces the belief that women are the ones that need to change to ensure theyre not attacked, as this is not something that can be avoided. That we are a vulnerable group that need special attention, the focus and responsibility is off men taking control of their actions. I also have concerns that this is something that will be used against women  what happens when you get on the wrong carriage or just choose not to be segregated  will a guy think you must be up for a little attention? This idea was suggested by women to Corbyn, which I dont doubt, because at a very superficial level it seems to offer an immediate solution to a big problem. Also as women, when we think of our personal safety we have to protect ourselves in this way. We dont have the luxury of saying hey Im going to do whatever I want to do, regardless of the long-term consequences, because the short-term consequences are too significant to disregard. This is going to be a bit of a blow to Corbyn, however I doubt this idea will be taken forward and the outcry seems to have effectively crushed this idea. In fairness this was only one of several ideas and he has said he would be consulting with women. I think it is important though that he consults with experts who understand the effects and consequences of any kind of campaign that has the intent of protecting women and the focus should be on the perpetrators of the harassment.'

S" The key sign that someone is trying to manipulate you is that they are making their emotional state dependent on you and the things you do. To some extent this is natural, if someone you care for does something nice for you, this makes you feel good if they do something you dislike, you will feel bad, but when people pass on the responsibility of those feelings to actions that they have no control of , thats when you know youre being manipulated. Recognising the telltale signs can be difficult due to the emotional components that are so strong. Here are things to watch for: Becoming specialTo start with the practiced manipulator will want to build the bond with you. A normal friendship will not be enough, they are likely to try and make you feel as if they consider you someone special. That you have made a difference to them. Many people will instinctively reject someone who comes on too strong early on in a relationship but if you have self esteem issues you may find yourself more vulnerable to someone like this. They may talk about really admiring you or elevating something youve done. People like this can give you a real ego boost. Ive never met someone that understands me the way you do, youre so insightful.Not taking responsibilityManipulators will frequently talk about life events of things that were done or happened to them. Bad things happen to everyone and many times theyre not our fault and were not responsible, but it is actually a healthy attitude to try and take responsibility in order to try and maintain some control. A manipulator is happy to relinquish this control.Taking exaggerated responsibilityA manipulator will go from not taking responsibility to taking an exaggerated responsibility that is so clearly and obviously not true. Example:Manipulator: I worked so hard this year but my boss passed me over for promotion for someone with less experience, this is so unfairFriend: Do you think it was because youve been coming in late a lot in the last few months.' Manipulator: I guess it must be, Im obviously really terrible at my job, because Im late all the time, but I was looking after my sick mother and I guess that makes me a really bad person. This is all deflecting. No one thinks they are terrible at their job or a terrible person because the look after their sick mother, but it is circumventing the issue that perhaps just coming in on time is important for some roles and denying responsibility that this is something that they can actually control. They want you to feel sorry for them. This leads to the next point.Pity. All their sad stories and terrible things that happen to them will invoke pity and they're OK with that. Most people have a big issue with people feeling pity for them. It hurts their pride and even when they tell you about something awful that happened to them, you won't feel pity you'll admire them for getting through it. Not the manipulator, this feeling is key to getting you to do what you want them to do, because even when you recognise that they're emotionally manipulating you, you may allow them to do this because they're just so pitiful.Disappointment because youve let them downManipulators will at some point transfer their disappointment of others into disappointment of you. Youve let them down. You didnt do what they wanted to you to do even though it was really important to them. 'It was so important to me that you turned up that day, because I really needed your support because my ex was there. I thought I would be more important than your hair appointment' This reproach will come after the event and not as a request for assistance beforehand. Trying to reason with them that you didn't know will not work as that would be not recognising how 'special' your friendship is.Guilt. Yours. After a while you will find that even when this person isnt manipulating you, you just feel this general sense of guilt. That youre just not living up to this persons expectations of you. You'll just feel like a generally bad person. This feeling is going to play on any self-esteem issues - which you will have if you're in this situation in the first place. It is worth noting that most people do some of the above things at some point, it isn't necessarily their attempt to manipulate you, most of the time they are actually your mum and they cant help themselves. For the rest, they may just be feeling insecure and concerned that you don't care. This doesn't mean you should worry. It is only if you find they're doing several of these things repeatedly and in conjunction with each other, that you're probably dealing with a manipulator. The most important thing to recognise though, is that someone cant become an emotional manipulator if no one allows themselves to be manipulated. Every con needs its mark."

S" We don't really judge the 'intent' behind question, so what I think is happening is that a question has been deleted or the tagged as rhetorical or insincere. This isn't so much about your intent, because we appreciate that it may well have been that you sincerely wanted to write that, we're referring to whether or not the phrasing of the questions is a sincere attempt to get answers. Here is an illustrative example: Why do people want to make my life difficult by asking problematic questions? This is rhetorical, because it is presenting the opinion that people want to make life difficult when they ask problematic questions. This comes across as insincere, because in reality I must know that most people have no idea who I am and how I might be affected by their questions.The only real answer is 'they don't want to make my life difficult'. However that's not really helpful because we still don't know why people ask these questions, which is the real question. We do appreciate though that asking these questions in this manner is very natural, and many people do it. Generally we try not to sanction users for this and instead we encourage them to fix their question, we may tag it with one of the Needs Improvement topics or Quora Moderation may give a specific reason. When it comes to questions about groups of people though, we tend to be more aggressive. Myself in particular will aggressively delete questions that seem to be making a point about a group of people rather asking an open question, particularly if asked anonymously.

S" Matching handbags/purses precisely with shoes used to be a sign of someone who took a lot of care with their appearance, but now it isn't considered necessary and can even look a bit dated. However, if you wish to be considered stylish then you should definitely be coordinating your bag and shoes and making sure they don't clash. Coordinating doesn't always mean the same colour, but that the colours work together. You should also take into consideration the material of the bag, for example, you possibly wouldn't carry an all patent bag if you're wearing all suede shoes even if they're the same colour. Many women don't like to change their bag on a daily basis, so try and play it safe with a neutral bag. I think this can work, but black isn't a great choice for this unless you only wear black shoes. A better choice for a neutral colour is brown or beige. As with any fashion rule, you should feel free to break it, but only when you know it well enough. Just breaking it because you through on whatever that morning, is not going to make you look stylish."

S" I work in the UK and Ive had to deal with some challenging working environments over the years. There was the boys clubI was a secretary and the only woman in a firm of consulting engineers and for some reason they decided that I, a secretary with zero experience, could replace the roles of a senior secretary and a junior secretary that had been there before me. Most of the time the guys were very friendly with me, in the way guys are when they are trying to hit on a woman. I didnt think too much of it though until we had a 16 year old boy working as intern over the summer. The first few days he was super polite, but within a few weeks, he was emulating the way he saw engineers treat me. I remember one afternoon, he hadnt yet taken the post to the post office (one of the few jobs he had to do). I went up to him and he was leaning back on his chair and had his feet up on the desk and wasnt inclined to take them down just because I was there. I asked him if he was going to take the mail to the post, he made some dismissive comment and the other engineers laughed. I went to get the post for him and by this time he had stood up and was still laughing, he stopped laughing though when I threw the entire bag of mail at him. The investment bankers  yes that is rhyming slang I remember on my first day of working with an investment bank, I was told that if a banker ever wanted to shout and scream abuse at me that I should just shut up and take it. That was an interesting way to start. That kind of set the tone of working in investment banks and yes I was shouted and screamed at a lot. I remember one evening, it must have been gone midnight and it was up to me to tell someone that their requested deadline wasnt going to be met (I worked on the presentations team). They just stood there and started to scream at me. People were watching but not saying anything. I was very upset and very angry, but it was clear that there was going to be no reasoning with him. I just turned around and walked out and was reprimanded for not being professional enough and just standing there to take the abuse. The firm where I actually thrived Initially my work (design/creative DTP) was focused on a fairly small department. This department liked to leave all their work for Friday afternoon, I would literally have no work Monday  Wednesday, then start to get it on Thursday, and by Friday I would be asked to do the work of 5 people, with the 5pm deadline so everyone could go to the pub. If I couldnt do the work  you know because I had like 4 other deadlines for that hour, theyd actually be super polite, but then they wouldnt give me any other work, even if I was quiet  it felt like I was being punished. Eventually I got the message, you cannot say no in this company. I had been given the remit to increase the amount of work we did this was to be done by not just working for this small department but the whole segment. Im excellent at networking and within a short space of time I managed not to just increase to the whole segment, but the whole company, unfortunately to my detriment. I was supposed to work 9am to 5pm, but I started at 8am and most nights I was there until 9-10pm, if I left at 7pm Id always get someone pleased for me that I managed to leave early. It was several years before anyone told me I should have been expensing my dinner and taking a taxi home, just like everyone else did. This went on for a long period of time, I kept telling my boss that I couldn't sustain the long hours and I was having to turn a lot of work away and she just kept stressing that once I prove that we had enough work she would increase our resources. I remember one day I had several deadlines due for that day, and someone came to me to push for one more piece of work. I reviewed their work compared to the work of the others and as it was not client facing for that day, so I decided it that it would have to wait. They went straight to my boss, who insisted it got done. I got it done, and 5 minutes after getting it done, I fainted and had to be sent home in cab. Luckily someone advocated on my behalf and we finally got a replacement for the part-time worker we had lost the previous year.Although I increased our chargeable work by a significant amount and changing us from a cost centre to a profit centre, there was no credit given to me, and all of this was dismissed as me being a social butterfly who had the consultants eating from the palms of my hands. I can only assume I would have gotten the promotion if I managed to increase our chargeable work whilst maintaining an antagonistic relationship with my internal clients. Despite all this I did eventually do fairly well and I even got to work a year abroad. Unfortunately at this time I also had to move flat in England and I had some issues with my expense receipts for my phone bills. I explained this issue to the Project Director and was told that this wasnt a problem, I could submit my expenses in the new year. In the new year when I submitted my expenses I was told hard luck I could no longer submit them and that was nearly 1,000 lost. My boss at the time was sacked for unrelated issues and there was no way of recouping this loss. A few years later I finally got the promotion but in a different role. It meant taking a lead in some areas and having to speak up in meetings. My suggestions would frequently be dismissed as not useful until 5 minutes later in the meeting when someone else would coincidently have the exact same thought as me and it instantly became the best idea ever. I asked my line manager what she thought was happening and how I could improve how I communicated. Her response Did all the other men in the meeting happen to be men?. Well yes indeed they were and I was then told to get used to it. Strange as it may seem the examples for this last company are just more numerous because I actually liked this company the best and stayed there the longest. There were definitely good aspects to working for them, but this is the worst of it."

S' The trick here is to base your quote on assumptions rather than trying to take a wild guess at what might be required.  Try and make these assumptions based on the time and requirements of similar projects. To keep your quote competitive, quote for the core service youre providing and then add the extras on top, as separate elements. Make sure it is clear that these are assumptions and anything outside of the defined scope of work will be charged as extra and at an hourly rate. This may not seem ideal, but your aim is to win the contract, without underselling yourself. Ideally you should also build-in a design requirements phase, not the actual design, but defining what will go into the design.Later when youre going through the requirements, you need to remember what your original assumptions were and align with these. If what the client is asking for is so wildly out of these requirements, then you make it clear that this is all extra at your billable rate, but you can also offer to rescope the work and present with a new quote.'

S' Generally there are going to be more potential advantages to continuing the process with little actual risk. The ones I can see are: RisksYou waste a little bit of your time that you had already decided to spend doing this anyway. This time is unlikely to be recouped at such short notice in any useful way.BenefitsUnknown but potentially:  You actually find out that you were wrong about not wanting the job and you do want it.That both you and the interviewer realise youre wrong for this job, but they realise youre right for another, much better job, this is not an unusual scenario.You get some practice with your interview technique. This can be really useful when you dont actually care about getting the job. All the benefits may seem unlikely, but two of these are potentially very rewarding, for the cost of a little time which you have effectively lost anyway. If you do decide to cut it short, you do risk annoying the interviewer, which may be a problem for you if you ever want to work in the company again, or any company that the interviewer may be working in in future.

S" British office etiquette is a hotbed of hidden traps and unspoken rules. You should consider any work you do secondary to your ability to navigate through this world and here I only lightly touch on the some of the etiquette you need to know. Tea  other hot beverages are available, allegedly In offices all over the UK people have decided rather than quickly go to the kitchen and get your hot drink for yourself when you need it  taking a couple of minutes, it would be much more efficient to get the orders for everyone in your designated area and get tea for between 2 and 10 people at a time. I say tea, but everyones order will be different, sugar, sweetener, semi-skimmed milk, skimmed milk, soya milk, maybe a few sneaky coffees for those continentals or American influenced people, definitely a few herbal teas and not to mention all the cheeky please fill up my water bottles'. Tea rounds often seem to catch people by surprise: 'Oooh tea, should I? Ooh I dont know, Ive had 12 already today  ooh go on then, if you insist  you devil ... hahaha  Ill get the biscuits out'. These people are liars, theyve been desperate for a tea for half an hour but they didn't have the time to do a tea round for 10 people. Theyve even wanted to go to the loo, but were worried theyd get missed. Some people hate this ritual, particularly if theyre not big drinkers and want to get out of the round system. These people are considered odd and eccentric but are tolerated, as long as they make sure they exclude themselves completely, you cant never offer to make drinks but ever accept the offer of others. In fact this last group is probably the most heinous of all people in the office. You will be considered lower than low; your colleagues will be full of contempt for you. On the plus side, youll never ever know this and youll still get offers to make you drinks. This will go on 30 or 40 years until retirement when youll find that everyone has signed your card Best Wishes for your Future Endeavours.Birthdays and other eventsIt is your birthday; you have to buy cakes. You dont like cake? Tough, youre buying cakes. Doughnuts are also acceptable, you can add biscuits as a supplement, but they shouldnt be the main feature. Good news, you dont have to spend a lot of money on cakes, but you do have to appear to be generous. Going to Sainsbury's and buying lots of teacakes and doughnuts will be viewed just as positively as buying a deluxe Opera cake from Pauls; as long as they are plentiful. You should make sure there are enough for everyone and a few stray people who coincidentally happen to be walking by at strategic and opportune times. If at the end of the day there isn't enough cake to feed another half a dozen people, you probably didn't buy enough.On a fairly regular basis a brown envelope will appear on your desk with a list of names some crossed out some not. Inside you will see a card either wishing someone a good birthday, happy retirement, congrats on leaving their job. You may or may not know the intended receiver. You should not say in a loud voice I dont know this person so I wont bother signing it. Tough, trust me when your special day comes around you will know how successful you are as a human-being by the amount of signatures on that card, so start earning good faith now. Signing the card can be tricky but the basics are: best of luck is good if you dont know them, best wishes on your future endeavours works when you hate them. If you actually like this person very much you should write something pretty insulting in the card to express familiarity. For example if a woman is going on maternity leave, you should feign surprise and make a pointed remark about her putting on weight. What woman wouldnt be moved to tears at that heart-warming comment? Before passing that envelope to the next person, give it a little jiggle. Does it make a noise? Then get your wallet out and put some money in. Please no complaints about how you always have to donate to these things. Boo-bloody-hoo! Everyone is in the same boat, your financial pressures should not be held out as better or worse than anyone elses financial pressures. Inappropriate office banterNon-British people can often be surprised about how Britain, a country that seems fairly polite and civil on the outside, is actually a hot bed of inappropriate office banter. People making saucy jokes to each other, commenting on various parts of each others anatomy, offering to run away with each other for illicit affairs. Many a hapless outsider has enjoyed this banter so much they have joined in, to suddenly find chairs spun around and having HR walk past their desk at regular intervals for the rest of the week asking how are they. Banter between colleagues is a very difficult thing to get right and not only that, a lot of the people you think are getting it right are getting it wrong but are tolerated for other reasons. Maybe theyve been in the company many years and have earned some latitude. You wont be penalised for not joining in, but you will have problems if you get it wrong. Just smile noncommittally when this is going on and dont be pulled in.Sick leaveSick leave in the UK is generous and most companies will pay you as normal and up to quite a significant amount of time. Some people really abuse this, therefore any sickness is viewed with suspicion. Here are some of the more important rules:Being sick on a Monday is an absolute no-no as people will assume youre still hungover from the weekend. The exception here is if youre actually still hungover from the weekend, then you might as well just take the time off.Being sick on a Friday is an absolute no-no as people will assume youre hungover from the Thursday drinks and/or you just want a long weekend. The exception here is if youre hungover from the Thursday drinks and/or just fancy a long weekend. Then it clearly makes sense for you to take the time off.Being actually sick with coughing and mucus should be something you should get to stay home with, but no, first you must come into the office so that you can be sure that everyone knows youre coughing and there is mucus involved. A couple of days of this should ensure you have people complaining that you should go home and not spread your germs. These will be the very same people who last week were coughing and imposing their mucus on you. Once 2 or 3 people have said this, you can go to your line manager and explain that as much as you want to finish those spreadsheets, youre annoying a lot of people by your very presence and maybe you should just stay home for a few days.Please believe me when I say that these are just the highlights of our etiquette system. The thing that makes us special is not the amount of rules, I'm sure this is the same in most countries, but you'll pretty much never know or be told if you get these rules wrong. You could be happily sitting at your desk thinking you're doing well and actually your cards have been marked because of an unfortunate encounter over a biscuit. If in doubt, avoid doing anything that could be considered controversial or different, even if everyone else is being controversial and different. Coming soon  do not do any of these things before youve read them: Working with people in support rolesThe hierarchy of the officePerformance reviews  giving and receivingOvertimeWorking from homeAfter work drinks"

Here is Quora\'s answer to What kind of questions on Quora aren\'t OK? What is Quora\'s policy on question deletion?Controversial opinions in answers are slightly different as they are your own views and don\'t represent the views of the community. However users should take care to that their answers abide by Quora\'s "Be Nice, Be Respectful" policy. It should also be noted that an individual answer may considered to be OK, but if a user is only on Quora to push forward a controversial agenda against a group of people, this may be deemed as causing hostility and harassment and may get you banned as well. Particularly if your answers in aggregate are considered hate speech.'

S' People like free food and when you\'re on an internship and not earning any money, getting a free lunch seems like a good idea. You could be right and she was hinting that she wanted you to pay, but she might have been hoping you would say \'hey did you know I\'m independently wealthy and actually get more money every time I buy someone a lunch, luckily my girlfriend doesn\'t mind because I\'m 100% faithful to her?". If you want to pay for her fine, but don\'t do it with the expectation that it is significant or it will lead to something. I have no idea if she likes you or just sees you as a colleague, but I do know that the type of people who date people because they got a free lunch are probably not going to be a good long term prospect. The great thing about this scenario is that you\'re probably going to get to know her a lot better over the next few days/weeks. If you want to treat her, don\'t be extravagant, keep it classy, buy her a coffee, but don\'t put her in position where either of you feel like she is indebted to you. On an end note, one of the most successful men I know with women is this guy who refuses to treat any woman. He doesn\'t care if he asked her out or she asked him out, he insists that the bill be split on every date, he does it purely as he thinks these things should be equal. He is upfront about this and has never had any trouble getting a date.'

S" They are trying to do you a favour and allowing you to resign. This means when you go to job interviews you can have your story ready for why this company didn't suit you and why you're the one looking for a better opportunity. This is much much better than having to tell interviewers that you were fired from your last job after a month and explaining to them why you're a bad fit for a small company.You should also consider this feedback carefully. To me what this feedback means is that you probably didn't try to do anything outside of your given role and just did what you think you were there to do. In start-ups and other small business they don't have the luxury of employees who will only do their given role and they need people who are hands on and always looking for how they can do more work, even if that is work they don't normally do. The thing is that attitude isn't considered great for large companies either, it isn't that they want you doing work that you're not there to do, but they don't want jobsworth people who aren't willing to help out when needed. This is just my interpretation though, it would be good for you and your future career if you get as much understanding as possible on why you were a poor fit for the company. Please note that although this company may be trying to do you a favour in allowing you to resign in these particular circumstances (i.e. you've only worked there a month), if you live in a country like the UK that has unemployment benefits there can be a good reason for not doing it like this and that is if you think you won't easily get another job. In this case you will want to 'sign-on' to get benefits and you can only do this is you were fired (you may still be eligible for income support though). Personally, I would still prefer to resign, even if I thought it could be 3 or 4 months before I got another job."

S" This is inline with how Dove have been advertising for a long time. They have these feel good ads that try and send the message that we as women should be challenging perceptions of ourselves and liberating ourselves from our insecurities. Were not really ugly or average, it is society telling us that were not attractive as we are and actually if we just accept ourselves well see that were really beautiful. Thats our choice. Sounds good eh? What is the real message of this ad though? Look at the women theyve chosen, sure I have no doubt some of these women have insecurities about themselves, but lack of make-up and dowdy clothes and the coyly apprehensive expressions on these womens faces, do not hide that these women are all above average in looks. So the real statement being made here is if you are already quite good looking you should own it and embrace it. What about women that are less conventionally beautiful, 200lbs overweight with a heart of gold or a woman with chronic acne who looks after the elderly, why arent they being shown embracing their beauty, why not show them being dragged through the beautiful door by their mums and friends  giggle  arent I cute because Im so humble and self-deprecating and chose the average door despite looking like a model. All it is, is a less glamorous beauty, which makes it seem more of an achievable kind of beauty.When it comes to really changing how women value themselves, I don't believe these ads make a blind bit of difference. This is not how you gain true confidence about your looks, you can't get this from a bottle of body lotion or being forced to carry a label for your looks. You get it when you stop caring about whether or not youre beautiful and get it when you actually just like how you look, flaws and all. You get it when you stick two fingers up at the Beautiful door and realise that it doesnt really matter which of those doors you go through that the funny and intelligent doors are the ones that have true meaning in life, the cake not the icing. But true body confidence doesnt a beauty cosmetics market make. It is important that when watching any beauty product ad that the more insecure you are, the more money they make. Dont get me wrong, I dont think the Dove marketing team sat around in a team meeting and said to themselves how can we screw with womens insecurities more than theyve already been screwed with. No one was thinking that much, but theyve built a brand on the concept of real beauty, real beauty meaning that compared to the average model, theyre a bit shorter, a bit bigger, a few years older, oh and they dont Photoshop women until theyre unrecognisable, but theyre not going to any real risks here, were not going to see any real challenges to what we already perceive as beautiful. The real aim of these campaigns, is just make beauty seem more attainable to the average woman. They're actually making people associate their product with realistic expectations of what it can achieve on a beauty level and at the same time make make women feel like they're embracing their 'real beauty'. It is win win for them and in all honestly from a marketing point of view, I think theyve done this really well. I just dont think we should be giving them any plaudits for revolutionising the world into the concept of real beauty because the 'real' difference between the women in the picture (from the ad) and the woman below is a lot of make-up and quite a bit of Photoshop.

S" There can be some value in more expensive make-up but it isn't necessarily what you would think it to be. Firstly look good is a subjective term, but when people are referring to makeup for the skin they are usually asking about a group of products designed to:Cover perceived flaws, like spots and pigmentation marksGive the skin a more uniform colour all overCover open poresFill-in linesMake the skin appear more matt if it has a problem with appearing too oily and shinyGive the skin more of a glow if it is sallowMake it look moisturised and dewy if very dry The main products designed to do this are:FoundationsPowdersConcealersPrimersIt is a significant area of cosmetics where there is a lot faith based on the idea that premium products are better than budget or mid-priced products. Although to some extent this is reflective of most things, but whereas most women wouldnt necessarily value or want a 100 white t-shirt over a 10 or 20 one, Im always surprised how many women are convinced that an expensive foundation is packed with scientific goodness that the cheaper products just dont have. When it comes to the large companies that most of us buy cosmetics from, there isn't as big a difference between premium and mid-priced cosmetics as magazines and adverts would have you believe. A company as large and as significant as LOreal will have a very large research and development budget in the same way Estee Lauder would have.It is easy to be seduced by some special ingredient like 'Crushed Unicorn Horn', 'Luxuriente FXC' or 'Biolore FN12'. OK I made them up, but then so do they. A large, global mid-priced-range company like Max Factor, has the buying power to put all the Luxuriente FXC it wants in its foundation. So for the most part, I do not believe the average person needs to spend more for cosmetics for their skin as than they can afford. This is not to say there arent some differences with the products and there is one key difference between premium and the mid-priced cosmetics that youll find on the shelves of Boots and Walmart and that is range of colours. Budget and mid-priced cosmetics are bought primarily off the shelf, at the front of the shelf youll see the tester and behind it youll see the stock of that colour. This means that each colour that is part of that range is taking up primary self space, and those cosmetic companies have to justify every shade of every product it wants to have on the shelf. Try convincing Boots that they need to keep that putrid green nail varnish, not because it sells but because it makes the company look oh so trendy to the young folk, but that you want to discontinue pale lilac dove even though they sell 1000 units a week, but the marketing department don't like it because only old ladies are buying it. Yet those are the kind of decisions that the merchandising department will have to make, but there will only be so many loss leaders it can justify, so generally each colour has to 'pull its weight'. Foundation colours really suffer here, and most people struggle to know if their skin is warm sand, golden sand, rosy sand or pale sand, so pulling some of the shades frequently doesnt make too much of a difference to their overall sales as people just go to the nearest colour, and instead they prefer to keep several formulas. The skin colours that really suffer here are the darker skin-tones. Women with a range of skin tones from pale to light olive, may get 4-8 shades to choose from, whereas women with skin-tones from medium olive all way to deep ebony will frequently have only 2 or 3 options  if that!Premium brands dont have the same limitations. They only display testers, so they can justify a much more thorough ranges of colours, the stock is not taking up the prime retail counter shelf and the majority is below in cupboards or just hidden towards the back of the shelves and they can just keep more of the popular colours. So if youre looking for a really accurate skin colour match  or you happen to be one of the millions of women who are darker than 'warm sand', then you may find it a lot easier to go to a premium brand if you want a good match colour for your skin. NB, there are some other differences between premium and mid-priced cosmetics, but I believe that this is the most significant one that will effect just how good your skin looks."

S" Deodorants and perfumes are designed to be applied directly to the skin. Deodorants need to be applied directly on to the skin in order to work effectively. Perfumes don't have to be applied directly to the skin, but if they are the perfume is frequently enhanced and has a more personal effect. Some people are allergic to perfumes and therefore should avoid them completely as they may find even the smell will irritate them. Some people with sensitive skin may find that their skin does get irritated if they use too much perfume, therefore applying perfume to their clothes instead of their skin may be desirable. If they do do this, they should avoid spraying perfume on delicate or light coloured fabrics as it can stain. Alternatively for the sensitive skinned people, they can spray a little perfume into their hairbrush and brush their hair with it and that can be a good way to use perfume without irritating their skin."

S" The creative director role of a fashion house is a design role and that is the route you will need to go. Working in shops and writing blogs may help you in other areas of fashion but if you want to be a designer, you have to focus on the design side of fashion. To go this route is more difficult than just becoming an established fashion designer. You will need to set yourself up to be better than the rest. The competition you will experience down the road for this is huge. You will need a combination of talent, hard work and tenacity to achieve this. To really set yourself out on the right path, the first step is that you need a degree. I'm not saying it is impossible to do without a degree, but you're 16 and there is no reason to skip this step at this stage of your life. Although at 16 you're not quite ready, so make sure you do well in your A-Levels. As you live in London the clear choice is the University of Arts London (UAL). UAL has two colleges that have undergraduate fashion design courses, Central Saint Martins (famous alumni: Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney) and the London College of Fashion (famous alumni:Jimmy Choo). The BA Hons in CSM is full time and the LCF is part time, so if you can't afford not to work, don't let that stop you. They also have a variety of other courses related to fashion design. Many people use this time to make a name for themselves. They get noticed by having provocative fashion shows and some fashion companies will try and talent spot at these events. After university there are a variety of avenues you can choose. You may decide to get an in-house role or you may set yourself up as a designer yourself. Entering competitions and getting awards for your design will help you make a name for yourself and this will add to your value. Yes being commercial is important, but being well known in the fashion circles has a commercial value as well."

S" There are so many acronyms in the bid process and so many of them seem interchangeable, half the time I'm not convinced whether the procurement teams themselves knows which one they should be using or what they should be asking. However, yes there technically there can be a difference. Bid Requests, Invitation to Bid (ITB), Invitation to Tender (ITT)This is usually asked for when there is a more defined project and the company knows (or frequently think they know) quite clearly what product or services they want to purchase. They will usually be a lot clearer about the scope of work and the deliverables required. Example: We invite you to bid to be the supplier for an employee engagement survey which will be for 6,000 of our 10,000 employees in 20 countries, in 18 languages. 80% of the surveys will be online but 20% or our employees will need access to a paper version. Request for Proposal (RFP) This is slightly different in the presentation. Here a problem or need and their requirement will be defined in the RFP and it is up to the supplier to make a proposal on how they fulfil this requirement. There is often a lot more vagueness on what the scope might be. Example: We would like to measure our employee engagement levels. We have have 10,000 employees in 30 countries, but we would like to do this in phases. 20% of our employees do not have access to a computer and will need to be provided with an alternative option.The Difference to the ClientAs you can see the criteria for the first is much more specific, whereas in the second it is more open. The proposal could be exactly the same on the other hand they may offer another option to the paper version of the survey (a mobile version for example), they may also pick up on the 'phases' and make suggestions for smaller cheaper surveys, or they may have a completely different idea that doesn't involve traditional surveys. The Difference to the Vendor/SupplierTo the company making the proposal there should be less difference. If you're asked to bid for a specific thing, then yes you should always bid for that specific thing. However if you have a better solution, then that shouldn't stop you from trying to weave that into your proposal just because they haven't asked for alternatives. If you have an opportunity to discuss with the client upfront though, do this. If this is coming from a big company, the chances are you're also working via a procurement team and procurement teams frequently have a generic process that covers everything from finding the best company to supply their toilet paper to the people they're going to choose as their RemCo executive compensation advisors. Don't stop yourself presenting your best solution, just because the procurement team have given their document the wrong name."

S" There are no absolutes to recognising an expensive perfume from a cheap one. So much of what we find appealing about smell is linked to buried memories and what we associate a smell with. However if we're talking in general there are a few tendencies that might apply. Cheap perfume tends to smell sweeter than average. This isn't because sweet smelling ingredients are just cheaper than others (although they can be), but because cheap perfume tends to be marketed for younger people (who tend to have less money). Younger people, particularly teenagers tend to have a poor sense of smell, so these sweeter scents are more subtle for them than they would be for a more developed nose. Another indicator, but by no means a guarantee is that more expensive perfumes are more likely to have several levels of fragrance. Essential oils (the ingredients of many perfumes, but less likely to be pure in the cheaper ones) are divided into top notes, mid notes and base notes. The top notes you smell immediately and last about half an hour, the mid notes develop after half an hour for 2-4 hours after that. Then come the base notes which is what is left on your skin at the end of the day. One of the reasons fake perfumes do so well and are much cheaper to produce, is because they replicate the top notes of a perfume and if you're lucky the mid notes. If you want to compare a fake perfume with a real perfume, you shouldn't compare them when first spraying, but see how they both smell on your skin after 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours. A cheaper perfume may smell bad or have no smell at all. Base notes in particular can be some of the more expensive ingredients in perfumery. Having said that, more and more perfumery now uses synthetic fragrances as they are becoming fantastically sophisticated and can produce some amazing aromas. Even cheaper perfumes that aren't fake, will still usually either be a single note or top note. If they do have medium or base notes, they won't be as pleasant or as sophisticated as more expensive fragrances. As I said, none of these are definite indicator of cheapness, Chanel No.5 is a single note fragrance, but is not cheap and it is also possible to make a sophisticated non-sweet smelling cheap fragrance (although if I'm honest I personally find Chanel No.5 a trifle cheap smelling if not actually inexpensive). Some people would compare perfume to wine, noting that expensive doesn't always mean better and isn't always recognisable as being pricier. There is some validity to this, but my impression of wine making is that a lot of the difference in expensive wines compared to cheaper wines, is due to the process of creating the product, whereas for fragrance a lot of the difference is due to the type of ingredients. Perhaps a more appropriate comparison to wine is that a good perfume may have the sophistication of a blended wine, compared to a single varietal. Imagine how a good Bordeaux tastes compared to a table wine, yet both will have their fans."

S" Ethyl alcohol does have a smell, but the fragrances you find in perfumery will easily overpower this. If you have a sensitive nose, you'll be able to pick up the slight alcohol smell, but it is faint. Having said that, most deodorants (at least the ones that I'm aware of) don't have ethyl alcohol in such high quantities. Deodorant gets sprayed on the body, primarily under the arms. A product with such a high percentage of ethyl alcohol would be very drying and it could also sting, particularly for women if they remove their hair from their underarms as this often makes the skin more sensitive and sometimes there are small cuts."

S' Its Financial Suicide To Own A HouseI am sick of me writing about this. Do you ever get sick of yourself? I am sick of me.But every day I see more propaganda about the American Dream of owning the home.I see codewords a $15 trillion dollar industry uses to hypnotize its religious adherents to BELIEVE.Lay down your money, your hard work, your lives and loves and debt, and BELIEVE!But I will qualify: if s1omeone wants to own a home, own one. There should never be a judgment. Im the last to judge. Ive owned two homes. And lost two homes.If were to write an autobiography called: My life  10 Miserable moments owning a home would be two of them.I will never write that book, though, because I have too many moments of pleasure. I focus on those.But I will tell you the reasons I will never own a home again.Maybe some of you have read this before from me. I will try to add. Or, even better, be more concise.ITS NOT AN INVESTMENTEveryone has a story. And we love our stories. We see life around us through the prism of story.So heres a story. Mom and Dad bought a house, say in 1965, for $30,000. They sold it in 2005 for $1.5 million and retired.Thats a nice story. I like it. It didnt happen to my mom and dad. The exact opposite happened. Butfor some moms I hope it went like that.Maybe Mom and Dad had their troubles, their health issues, their marriage issues. Maybe they both loved someone else but they loved their home.Heres a fact: The average house has gone up 0.2% per year for the past century.Only in small periods have housing prices really jumped and usually right after, they would fall again.The best investor in the world, Warren Buffett, is not good enough to invest in real estate. He even laughs and says hes lost money on every real estate decision hes made. Hes a liar also. So I dont know. But thats what he says.Theres about $15 trillion in mortgage debt in the United States. This is the ENTIRE way banks make money.They want you to take on debt. Else they go out of business and many people lose their jobs.So they say, and the real estate agents say, and the furniture warehouses say, and your neighbors say, its the American Dream.But does a country dream? Do all 320 million of us have the same dream?What could we do as a society if we had our $15 trillion back? If maybe banks loaned money to help people build businesses and make new discoveries and hire people.HOUSING IS NOT AN INVESTMENT, PART IILet me tell you the qualities of a good investment good investment:Its not the bulk of your net worth. Good investments are usually part of a diversified set of investments you make in your life, including the investment you make in yourself (acquiring more skills, having more experiences, etc).It doesnt require heavy debt. (see above, i.e. $15,000,000,000,000)You can get your money back when you need it.From hard experience I know when I needed money most, its exactly at those moments I cant get it. The house cant get sold.And the bank that was so friendly lending the money, starts calling within 12 hours of not getting their check. And then starts suing me.Usually when I make an investment, Im not the one getting sued. Except when I buy a house.ISNT RENTING LIKE THROWING MONEY DOWN THE TOILET?No, renting is like making money. And I will tell you how.Lets say you want to buy a $500,000 house at a 6% mortgage.You put $200,000 down.The entire house would rent for about $2500, give or take. So thats 80 months or almost eight years worth of rent you just gave to the bank in a single check.Do you ever get that bank money back?No, because after mortgage debt (most of which cannot be written off in taxes), property maintenance, and taxes (which go up with inflation and are almost never considered in the price of the house), closing costs, buying costs, title insurance, property upgrades, etc. the homeowner might spend close to $1,000,000 in the lifespan of the house. Or twice that.So instead of writing that $200,000 check in one day (as opposed to spreading rent out over eight years and the landlord is in charge of all maintenance, taxes, etc so you dont have to deal with it), you could invest in yourself.Can you get more than 0.2% a year investing in yourself?I hope so. Simple example: If you take two or three courses in a month on WordPress development, you can take freelance jobs making $5000 a month.I know 14 year olds doing that. Illustration, ghostwriting, 3D rendering, are other skills you can learn. And many more. There are 1000 ways to make more.How much do those courses cost? Often nothing. But definitely less than a mortgage.Every investment in the world is judged by its SAFETY VERSUS ALTERNATIVES. A house investment is not safe versus the alternatives.HOUSE OWNER: ITS GOOD TO HAVE ROOTSThe average house owner, owns their house for 4.5 years. Some own for much longer, some own for less. Thats just an average.4.5 years is not roots.Why do people move? Because jobs are no longer as stable as they once were.And they are no longer in one or two cities but all over the country or world.So the original reasons for owning a house (a guaranteed easy commute into an urban area where the jobs are) are no longer valid, as demonstrated by the increasingly short lifespan of house ownership.This is a trend that is continuing forever.OPPORTUNITY COSTThe other day my sink broke. How come? Because hair falls out in the shower, stuff gets put in the toilet that shouldnt go there, food gets caught in the pipes, and a million other things.My house is 150 years old. It used to be a hotel. Things break. Pipes crumble in the hands of the plumber.I email the landlord, who calls a plumber, who gets new pipes that are paid for by the landlord. The landlord wasnt expecting it but thats what they signed up for.Meanwhile, I read a book on the couch in the other room.The same thing when Hurricane Sandy came over the river. People were canoeing in the street outside my house. The water filled two feet in my house.This is the first time in 100 years the water got this high, the landlord told me. So he ripped up floors, cleaned out mold, fixed furniture, and took care of it.This time I was upstairs reading a book.FLEXIBILITYSome people like to know where they will be in 30 years. They feel comfort in that.When you rent, you never know if you will be kicked out eventually or if the house will get sold and you have to move.So there is no judging here. But I like flexibility in my life. I like to know I can move. And in my area, so many houses are for sale, I always know I can find a good place to rent.And with so many houses for sale, I know those people are stuck while I am not.Will it always be that way? No. Things cycle. But America has a tendency to overbuild. And then people overbuy. And then rentals are available.I always look at rentals. Right now there are better houses for less rent available within a mile of my house. But I like my landlord and house and I dont blow a good thing if I have it.I live right on the river and can watch the leaves turn green and in the summer there are giant parties in the park next to my house.And on Sunday nights they show movies outside next door and the whole town shows up. I watched Bladerunner.But I still want the ability to pick up and move at a moments notice if I want to. Freedom makes me happy.PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE THE BASIS OF AMERICAMany people like to own real estate because of the word real. It feels more real than money.Or stocks. Or bonds.I get that. It is real. And in America, nobody can take your land from you if you own it.But not many people own their land. The bank owns it. Hence the $15 trillion in debt.And people will never own it (the 4.5 year average thing).But this is a judgment call again.I like to know I can live out of a single bag. Ive been doing that all my life.When I moved to NYC I lived out of a garbage bag. Before I got married I lived in a dive hotel. After I got divorced I lived in the same hotel.I like feeling like I could lose everything and survive. Maybe this is why I have lost everything sometimes. But its also how I keep surviving and learning more each time.This will sound corny so please skip to the next part: but property rights are not real.Loving who you are and where you are and what you are doing is the only thing that is real.Live in your heart and not your home and you will never feel lonely or the need to establish roots.Share that love with the people around you. And then, they also, will feel less need for roots.That is the best investment. That is the best return on investment. That is the best home to live in.The America Dream has us chained us to the land so they can feed us like pigs in a trough with debt, with factory/cubicle jobs that we cant escape because its so hard to move (until they kick us out with 2 weeks severance), with forced friends in our neighbors, with supposed roots for our kids even though the statistics show those roots are a lie.Freedom is more important than a dream.Everyone has the story. They have bought and sold three houses and made money on each of them.I believe them. Perhaps many people are phenomenal investors.Others live in a good, secure neighborhoods that they want their kids to grow up in.I believe those people also. But Ive also seen the pain theyve gone through when jobs were not as stable as they thought or marriages are not as stable as they thought and that mortgage wouldve been nice in their hands instead of in the banks hands.We need a little bit of breathing room in order to survive when the noose is put around our neck.WHAT DO I DO THEN?You can rent. Just like some houses are bad and some are good, some landlords are better than others. Like anything that is an important life decision, it takes research.You can find roots with a good landlord. You can even paint the house and knock down walls and do whatever you want.If you believe in housing as an investment, there are companies that just own houses that you can invest in on the stock market.So you get all the benefits of a long-term investment in housing and get your cash out in five seconds if you need it.But what should you do with all of that extra cash you have if you dont own a house?Maybe nothing. Having cash is a nice thing. It reduces stress.But also you can invest in yourself. Or companies that are growing.If companies arent growing, I can tell you that housing prices will go lower. Because housing prices depend on the stability of employment.By definition then, companies will always grow faster than housing, in aggregate.Average income for people age 18-35 has done from $36,000 to $33,000 in the past twenty years. While debt has increased 100x. Not good.WHY DO PEOPLE ALWAYS ARGUE FOR HOUSINGTheres something called investment bias. Your brain thinks, Ive just made the biggest investment of my life so it must be right.Your brain loves you. It doesnt want you to think it made a bad decision for you. Its scared you wont use it anymore.So it tells you, that $200,000 down was the best decision you ever made. Everything else involves flushing money down the toilet, or no roots, or no stability! So its hard to consider the alternatives.Its a lot of work to own a house also. Have you ever spent time in the Death Star? I mean Home Depot. That place is huge. And I only need that one special color of paint.But where is it? The stormtroopers at Home Depot are never around when you need them.And what about that snake that can clean my toilet. Where is it? And how do I use it? And is it gross? Why do they call it a snake?Its no wonder that plumbing is one of the highest paid professions in America.And how long does it take to paint a house. Or who do I go to? And will they overcharge me if they pave the driveway?Did I calculate that into my total cost of owning a house?I like to sit in the garden area of Home Dept. Theres thousands of flowers and plants and it smells like dirt.To be honest, thats the closest I will ever get to hiking  sitting in the garden area of Home Depot.Im pathetic. And I flush my rent down the toilet. And I dont have roots. And I refuse to fix my toilets or shovel my driveway or deal with my flooded basement. All I like to do is read.And one day Ill move. Maybe next to an ocean. And take a walk on the beach. Last week, a friend told me the sun sets in the West.Maybe one day Ill move to California. Five years until my youngest graduates.Ill sit on the porch and watch the sun set and have cash in the bank (I hope) while someone is fixing my toilet.When the sun has 15 minutes yet to live that day, maybe I will feel like Im falling in love.Read More: Why I Am Never Going to Own a Home Again - Altucher Confidential'

S" In the mid-90s I had an idea that lasted about the amount of time it takes to drink two beers. I say this because I had the idea at a bar and it was quickly squashed by the two friends I was with.I wanted to create a reality cable channel. All reality TV all the time. Reality TV was just beginning. MTVs The Real World and HBOs Taxicab Confessions were the only real two successful examples at that point. The day before, I had gone to a seminar at the Museum of Television and Radio about The Real World. All of the guests of my favorite season (but not Puck or Pedro, who was dead) were there answering questions. I felt reality TV was a cheap way to produce TV and people would get obsessed by it, particularly if sex was involved.What a dumb idea, a friend said. Theres only so much reality. Which strikes me as funny now.The other guy said, youre not a big TV company. How will you get the cable companies to go for the idea?So I never thought about it again. I put up a fence around the idea and decided I would not be able to leap over that fence to execute on the idea. Now EVERY television channel is basically all reality all the time, or at least 50% of the time.My real problem was: I didnt have confidence. And I didnt know what the next step was. In retrospect, I shouldve written down my idea, written down ten ideas for possible shows to launch with, and started pitching TV companies to get someone to partner with me on it. That wouldve been simple and not taken too much time before there was some payoff.Note: what might be too big for you (thinking of the next step) might not be too big for someone else (they might easily know, and not be afriad of, what the next step is).Quick example:I was first asked a similar question a few months ago and I replied that an idea would be too big if you cant think of the next step. I then added that if I wanted to start an airline with more comfortable seats and internet access and better food and cheaper prices I might have a hard time because even if it were a good idea I wouldnt know what to do next.Then I read about Richard Branson.When Virgin Records was making him a tidy profit of about $15 million a year he decided there should be a more comfortable cross-atlantic airline. What the hell did he know about making an airline? Nothing. Not only that, airlines are a difficult business. Three of the best investors in history: Howard Hughes, Carl Icahn, and Warren Buffett have crashed and burned buying airlines. Warren Buffett once said something like that the best way to end up with a billion is to start with two and buy an airline. And yet Branson came up with the idea and that very day he called up Boeing to find out what it would cost to lease an airplane. He made a great deal with them that if it didnt work out he could return the airplane. Else if it did work out, hed be a great customer for them. Im assuming he made a similar call to Airbus and took the best deal.He then probably found out what it cost to lease space in the various airports he would need to use. They were probably happy with more business. And then, Im guessing, he hired some pilots, some ground crew, and put an ad in the paper advertising his new air routes and he was in business.Virgin Air is successful (I just flew it from NY to LA a few weeks ago) and has since spun off Virgin Galactic. So this scruffy kid who started a record label is now sending rocketships into space.Note the important thing: the day he came up with the idea he also called Boeing and got a plane from them. So he took the next step. For me, I wouldve convinced myself that the next step in starting an airline was too big for me. And then it wouldve been too big for me. This is not quite the same as the secret  the idea that our thoughts can create our reality butthey do. If you think you can do something, if you have confidence, if you have creativity (developed by building up your idea muscle discussed in many other posts here), the big ideas become smaller and smaller. Until there is no idea too big. Nothing you cant at least attempt.On a much smaller scale I can state a few examples of my own but Ill stick with one. I had an idea to create a financial news site that didnt have any news but was just a site made up of various methods to come up with investment ideas. In particular, by piggybacking the investment ideas of the greatest investors. I spec-ed out the site the morning I had the idea, I put the spec on Freelancer, several developers contacted me with prices, and I hired one of them. Within a few weeks, version 1.0 of the site was released, Stockpickr. 7 months later and millions of unique users later, I sold the profitable company to The Street.So the question is not necessarily, when is an idea too big its: how do I make all ideas smaller and achievable. You do this by developing the idea muscle.One of the ways to build the idea muscle is by writing down 10 ideas a day.About what?About anything. It doesnt matter if they are business ideas, book ideas, ideas for surprising your spouse in bed, ideas for what you should do if you are arrested for shoplifting, ideas for how to make a better tennis racquet, anything you want. The key is that it has to be ten or more.You want your brain to sweat.You want your brain to hurt to come up with more and more ideas. One possibility right now is to list ten ideas that are too big for me and what the next steps might be. For instance, one idea might be launch solar panels into outerspace to more efficiently generate solar power. Another idea might be, genetically engineer a microbe that sucks the salt out of water. I have no idea if thats even possible. Another idea might be, within one year I am going to write a book and give away a million copies for free.The first step would be to write the book. Then maybe I can crowd fund on kickstarter to give the book away for free. OR, I can maybe print up nano-sized copies of the book so that you can only read it with a microscope but it would only cost me a couple of sheets of paper to print up a million copies. And so on. With the solar panels, I can call up SpaceX and see how much it would cost to rent space. For the microbe that desalinatesI have no idea. Can you help me?You dont ever have to look at these ideas again. The purpose is not to come up with a good idea. The purpose is to have 1000s of ideas over time. To develop the idea muscle and turn it into a machine.Here are some FAQ's about becoming an idea machine:A) Do you have a theme each day for your ideas?Yes. As a simple example it might be 10 businesses I can start? Or 10 books I can write or 10 chapters I can write for a book on quality parenting (which would obviously be a fiction book).A theme is like a target, and knowing that you can come up with 10 decent ideas gets you closer and closer to hitting the bullseye on the target.B) What if I cant come up with 10 ideas?Heres the key: the first three ideas are always easy. The next two are a little harder, and for me, I find that ideas 5-10 make my brain literally sweat. It almost hurts.Ideas, art, business, life is all about connecting the dots of one area of your life with the dots in other areas of your life.Doing this directly translates into biologically building up the neural pathways between collections of neurons in your brain.This is what changes you from becoming a person with the occasional idea, to a creative person, to an idea machine. You become the one-eyed king in the land of the blind.D) My idea muscle has atrophied. How long will it take to become an idea machine?If you come up with 10 ideas a day for 180 days Im pretty convinced based on what Ive seen from 100s or 1000s of others then you will be a full force idea machine.To read the other FAQ's, click here."

S' This is the wrong question. It\'s upside down.But ok. Another friend of mine wrote a good post on this topic. But I know him and how he made his millions and although his answer was good, it wasn\'t how he made his money.Money is not everything. It\'s a side effect. It\'s a byproduct. It\'s nuclear waste after all the energy has already powered the Earth.Focus just on the habits. Only the first half of the question.Everyone needs different habits. If someone has an arm amputated he needs a new arm. Another person might need a new eye.Another person needs to listen better.20 HabitsI\'m sorry. I was about to answer. But I need to define "habit".When I was lying in the gutter at 3 in the morning, drunk, and cars swerving around me, I needed first to be pulled to the sidewalk.That was a habit. I couldn\'t just wake up and be sober. I needed to be pulled to the side first. I needed consequences first. I needed one day at a time first. I needed to surrender control of the outcome first.I needed to improve 1% a day and that never ends. I needed to remember I had two little girls to be a better person for.1% compounds into many millions. And so on. "And so on" is a habit. It\'s not a done thing. It\'s never done.20 Habits- Every day, be around people who are kind to you and love you.This is a difficult habit. So don\'t sweat it. Just improve a little bit each day.A bonsai tree grows every day. But the bonsai master knows where to prune to create a work of art over years.- Every day, avoid death.Which means: avoid things you know are bad for you. Be a little healthier each day. You can\'t get rich from a hospital bed. Or a grave.People think metabolism changes as we get older. This is not really true. What changes is we sit more. So move more.- Solve difficult gratitude problems.This is a practice. When angry, or stressed, find one thing to be grateful for. Where is the practice? Is this really so hard.The hard part is noticing that you are angry and stressed. It\'s the difference between being scared in a movie and saying, "wait, it\'s just a movie".- Write down ten ideas a day.I\'ve written this a million times. Watch the movie "Limitless". Bradley Cooper takes a pill that turns him into a superman of brain power. Writing down 10 ideas a day is that pill. Try it for six months and you will see.- Plant seeds.Many people have ONE GOAL in life. And they aim their lives for that one goal. Good luck with that.The real key is to plant many seeds. 1% of the seeds planted will turn into 50% of the flowers. That\'s Garden Math.What are some seeds?Send a thank you letter. Send an intro letter. Send ideas to people. Exercise. Eat well. Surprise your spouse. Make a website. Come up with an idea. Write an article. Read a book. Think of 100 more seeds.Every day plant some seeds.- No excuses.Blaming is draining. Complaining is draining. Explaining is draining.People say, I don\'t have enough time. I get that. For instance, I don\'t have enough time to become a professional astronaut.But even that excuse, which two seconds ago I thought was a truism, is false.One day Virgin Galactic and SpaceX will send tourists into space for cheap. So one day I\'ll be an astronaut.I have enough time again. No excuses.- Warren Buffett\'s 5/25 rule.Make a list of the 25 things you want to do in life. Now do the top 5. And NEVER THINK ABOUT THE OTHER 20 EVERY AGAIN.Else they will take time away from the 5 that are most important to you.- Follow up.I\'m really bad a this. Which is why I have to build a habit instead of "do this!"The other day I had dinner with a bunch of interesting people. I have a perfect idea how to follow up with them.But I havn\'t done it yet. I don\'t know why. It\'s hard for me to followup.So it\'s a practice. But I\'ll do it. I want to get better at this habit.Following up might be a "nice to meet you" email. Or maybe it\'s buying them a first edition of their favorite book. Or maybe it\'s one of the 10,000 things in between that.- Stand next to the smartest person in the room.Harold Ramis did it (Bill Murray). Steve Jobs did it (Steve Wozniak). Craig Silverstein did it. (who? Larry Page.) Kanye West did it (Jay-Z).I\'ve done it repeatedly. (Yoda). I have a motto: "I am the dumbest person in the room". Then it helps me to find the smartest person in each room.The smartest person in the room is going to do something. Watch what they do. Something special. Just follow them without asking questions.- Do one thing every day you loved as a kid.I loved to write. So I write every day. I loved being nice to girls. So I\'m nice to women every day.Other people loved sports. I didn\'t.- Ask questions.Brian Grazer, the world famous movie produce or Apollo 13, Arrested Development, and about 100 other movies, would have "curiousity conversations".He\'s simply call up anyone he wanted (the Dalai Lama, Steve Jobs, etc) , explain who he was, and asked them questions.That\'s how he met Ron Howard (the smartest person in his room). That\'s how they together started Imagine Entertainment. That\'s how he\'s now got the top show on TV ("Empire").- Make MistakesI was teaching my daughter to serve harder. She had a good consistent serve. She never missed. But it was too soft. Easy to return.So I said, "hit it so hard you have to grunt".She started missing. She was getting depressed. Every shot came in about 6 inches to the left of the box.But then she adjusted. The shots started to hit in the box. And they were harder.I asked her, "what was going on in your head?"She said, "I saw I was hitting too much to the left so I moved it over."If she kept hitting her safe easy shot, she never would have improved.Only mistakes made her improve. ONLY MISTAKES.- Sleep.Everyone has a different opinion on this. I sleep nine hours a night. Then I try to take a nap during the day.Your brain is most active 2-5 hours after you wake up. Do your productive passion work then.Stay away from people who claim they only need 3-5 hours a sleep a night. They are evil.- Say "NO"I used to travel a lot for meetings. None of them made money. Not a single one.I remember one time sitting by the pool at a hotel in LA. That was fun. I drank and swam and drank and swam.In between, I had meetings that went nowhere. Then I went back to my company.How was LA.Great.One week wasted.- A little every dayI want to write a novel.I write a few paragraphs a day. I maybe tweak the outline every day. Guess what. If you write three paragraphs a day you\'ll write four novels a year.Three of them might be bad. Maybe ten of them will be bad. Maybe the first twenty will be bad.That\'s ok. That means in five years you will be a success. Because of "a little every day".- Don\'t be in a rush.I\'ve interviewed about 150 successful people so far for my podcast. I don\'t mean "financial success". Again, money is a byproduct.One thing in common: 10 - 20 years for an overnight success.BUT...Celebrate small successes.Along the way to overnight success (20 years) you will have many many small successes.You can only give yourself permission for the next one if you celebrate the small success. It gives reinforcement to all of these habits.Plus, it\'s fun. You know what I mean.- LoveI don\'t have to teach you what love is. But here\'s what I try to do:a. if it\'s someone I don\'t know, I pretend like they are going to die tomorrow. So I treat them with the love we treat someone who will not exist anymore.b. if it\'s someone I don\'t like, I treat them the way a mother treats her child. I wish for their best, no matter what my personal feelings are.c. if it\'s someone I love but is not making me happy, I sincerely wish them the best for the future.d. if it\'s someone I love, I listen. I help. I surprise.Often we pray to things that don\'t exist. Often we meditate with invisible goals in mind. Often we believe in science fiction.But right this second you can feel love, and that\'s the only religion.- Right now.Every time I\'ve had a problem in the future, it never came true.Every time I\'ve had a regret in the past, the regret kept me glued to the mud.Right now you are dealt cards. No other hand before or after will help you right now.So this is the only moment to focus on. Right now is best predictor of Right Life.---I said I had 20 habits. I can\'t count that high. So I don\'t know if this is true. I give myself permission to not be exact all the time.Oh! That\'s another habit: Give yourself permission to not always be right. Give yourself permission to not always be liked. Give yourself permission to not always be at peace. Give yourself permission to not be a success.Then you will gradually have whatever you gave yourself permission "to not".--Will these habits make you a millionaire? Yes. Definitely.Will these habits make you a success? Yes.But more important:These habits will make you the sort of person who has these habits.No longer will you be a single ray of light. You will be the sun.'

S' Six years ago I was so depressed I thought I would kill myself. I had nothing going on in my life. And the girl I was dating kept calling me "crazy", would break up with me every day, and refuse to introduce me to her friends. I had three failed businesses that year and the year before. And I was going to go broke with two kids to support. This past year, one of my investments sold for 4000% of my initial investment. A business I started went from $0 in revenues to $12,000,000 in eight months. I published two books and wrote 100s of articles and do 12 podcasts a week. But I don\'t work hard. I\'m about to go get a sandwich. I slept late today. I don\'t say this because it\'s so great. I\'d like to be a little more effective in my work. It\'s a practice and not a formula. Every day I practice. Here\'s what I do. If you don\'t like it, that\'s fine. I think each person has to find what works for them. I used to not do these things. And when I didn\'t do these things, nothing would happen. Life doesn\'t stand still: it either gets worse or better. Eventually it gets a lot worse. We die. That\'s the only real truth. But in the meantime, here\'s what I try to do to be successful and work harder. - NOTHINGI don\'t read the News. I used to work for the news. I know what happens there. The more you read news, the less informed you are, the more time you just wasted. Since I stopped reading news, I read more books. i get more info. I feel more alive. I get less scared. I also don\'t talk to people who want to gossip. Gossip never made anyone a success. And I don\'t say "yes" to things I don\'t want to do. Else I resent the person who asked me, I hate myself for saying yes, and I\'m bad at whatever it is I said "yes" to. So, in order to work harder, I try to find as much NOTHING in my life as possible. - EAT WELLIt\'s a simple diet but I try to follow it. No snacks. No eating after 6pm (so my liver isn\'t on overdrive when I am trying to sleep). Plates at 10 inches. (Studies show when you reduce plate size from 15 inches to 10 inches, you eat 30% less calories). Note! If your plate size is 8.5 inches, you eat more - your body is not stupid. It knows you are tricking it. And that\'s it. The Plate Diet. Or the - not after 6pm Diet- MOVE A little exercise every day is known to have just as much effect on your mood as a full dosage of anti-depressants. - SLEEPIn the morning, you have energy. At the end of the day, you don\'t. Which is why you need sleep. The average person needs eight hours of sleep. For instance, they took some famous orchestra and determined that the professional violinists in the orchestra were sleeping 8.6 hours a day. Don\'t think that less sleep makes you more productive. Whenever I get only six hours of sleep, I know the day is going to be useless. Preparation is how you win the game, and lack of sleep means you didn\'t prepare well. - GRATITUDEWorry never solves tomorrow\'s problems, and only takes energy away from today. Worry and Gratitude can\'t exist in the mind at the same time. Regret and Gratitude can\'t exist in the mind at the same time. Anger and Gratitude can\'t exist in the mind at the same time. Whenever I notice these things happening in my head, I try to replace with gratitude. Now I can continue my day - LAUGHTERThe average child laughs 300 times a day. The average adult...five. Dr. Norman Cousins did a series of studies on the benefits of laughter. It improves health, cures disease, improves productivity, and of course, makes you happier. So I try to watch standup comedy when I\'m low. Or thing of funny things. Laughter heals the soul. - SURRENDERToo often I would try to control things that were outside of my control. For instance, when a boss is yelling at me, it\'s his problem. I can\'t control him. So that\'s when I try to find a better job rather than put up with abuse. The same in relationships. One of the most important decisions you can make in life is who you spend your time with. It\'s like falling into an sea of hands and hoping they catch you. When you surround your self with good people, you can surrender that they will catch you. When you are creative, you can surrender to the fact that your ideas will always catch you.When you sleep well and are grateful, you can surrender to the fact that your good health and spiritual attitude, will guide you through the difficult moments. Whenever I\'m scared, I surrender. I do my best. I\'m honest. I know good things will happen. IDEASI write down ten ideas every day. The Idea Muscle always needs to be exercised. It atrophies after about two weeks of no use. like any other muscle. People think that ideas are nothing and execution is everything. Execution is just a subset of ideas. You still have to have the ideas in order to execute. And the only way to have good ideas is to exercise the idea muscle. Every day. The result: your life will look completely different in six months. You will be an idea machine. You can be stuck on a highway in the desert with no gas and you will have 100 ideas to save you in no time. The idea machine is magic. FRIENDSThe people in your life are like a bonsai tree. It\'s always growing. And every day you prune the bad branches and keep the good branches. Do that every day and you get more productive. Every entrepreneurial movement, every artistic movement, every leap in science, was done by a group of people. There are no lone geniuses. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates had the HomeBrew Club. Jack Kerouac had the BeatsAndy Warhol had his community of Pop artists. Even Larry Page had the thriving entrepreneurial cultures of both Stanford and Silicon Valley and all the search engines before him that he was able to stand on the shoulders of. You can\'t be productive without shoulders to stand on. MESSAGE OVER MONEYI think people are scared. I know this. I am often scared. We live in a hard world. It\'s a sentence of frightening nightmare punctuated by periods of intense joy. The message I like to convey is that these ideas help you not only be more productive, but more creative...happier. At least for me, this has worked and transformed me from someone crying on the ground in a pool of vomit, to someone who wakes up and (some of the time) feels the full beauty of the day. I do the above. I surrender to it. And hope for the best.Read More:The 100 Rules for Being an Entrepreneur '

S' Many people make a "to do" list. I used to make that list also. And it felt great. I\'d make the "to-do" list and then every time I did something on the list I\'d cross it off and felt a sense of accomplishment. Woo-hooo! I called five people by 11am! Accomplishment releases all of these chemicals in the brain that then make you feel better. Very addictive chemicals. Dopamine, Endorphines, blah blah. So I\'d put more things on the to-do list. More people to call. More things to write. More places to go or people to meet. Ugh. What the hell. Then at the end of the day I\'d be spent and I\'d feel bad for not finishing the things on my list. What a waste. I\'m a waste. I\'m a waste of human life. On my deathbed: "I didn\'t finish my to-do list". Now I have ONE thing on my list and then I\'m done: I have to create one thing. This doesn\'t mean I\'m an artist. Most things I create are really bad. Yesterday I made my first Vine video. Vine lets you make these six second videos. Here\'s my Vine. I shared it on Twitter.That was my "thing" of the day. It\'s neither good or bad. It was my one thing: Vine by James AltucherWhat happens when you only have one thing on your "to-do" list?More emails don\'t get answered. Most phone calls don\'t get returned. People think you\'re a jerk. I don\'t know. Lots of bad things happen. Things slip through the cracks. And where do they go? I have no idea. Garbage. People get disappointed. That\'s ok. They\'re all going to die. They won\'t say on their death bed, "everything would\'ve been better if James just returned my call." One thing a day not only adds up, it compounds: - you have the one thing- you learn from creating one thing. That learning makes the next "one thing" better. - once you have a lot of "one things", each markets the other. - You learn new tricks. I had never used Vine before, for instance. - Without the pressure of everything else, your "one thing" gets your full focus and energy. This doesn\'t mean the other things don\'t get done. I still make calls to people I want to. I still talk to people or write stuff or do podcasts or take care of business and hang out with Claudia or my kids. But these things just aren\'t on a list. A MUST-DO-TO-BE-HAPPY List. BUT then at the end of the day, I do my "I Did" list. Even though only one thing was on my "to do" list. A LOT of things get on my "I DID" list. Because in the 15 or so hours I\'m awake, if I spend one hour doing my one thing, I have 14 hours to do a lot of other things, all things I want to do. People I want to be with. Idea lists.Things I\'m grateful for.But what if I work a 9 to five job?Ok, that\'s fine. If you listen closely enough to what your life is telling you, there\'s a lot of empty silences and pauses. You can do whatever you want in those silences. What if I have to take care of kids when I\'m outside my job? Same thing.I\'m not going to give the BS line: "children are our greatest teachers". They aren\'t really. They are mostly annoying. They are hard work. The best thing a kid teaches us is patience and how to avoid these new, very enticing kinds of anger and annoyance. I had nothing extra on my "to do" list this past week. But when I look back at my "I did" list I\'m very proud. If I had to pick one thing I\'d want to share it would be to check out my podcast with Hugh Howey. Two and a half years ago, Hugh was working in a bookstore, shelving books for $10 an hour. On the side he was writing novels. He had no publisher so he was self-publishing through Amazon and then hoping some of his friends or family would read his books. "I thought if one reader liked a book then it would be worth it," he told me. I would give up on one novel if nobody read it. I\'m a wimp. Most publishers will give up on you as well. Which is why Hugh kept self-publishing.Hugh wrote nine novels. He had a full time job the entire time.On his ninth novel (ninth!), "WOOL", a lot of people liked it. So he wrote "WOOL 2", then "WOOL 3", then "WOOL 4", then the "WOOL Omnibus" that collected them all. Soon his books were all in the top ten for science fiction on Amazon. Now everyone was reading his books! And people were reading his back books. He had done zero marketing. Doing that one thing a day proved to be the BEST marketing. This is what many people don\'t get. So he wrote more: "Dust", "Shift", "Sand", and more. His one thing each day: write. Ridley Scott bought the movie rights to "WOOL". Simon & Schuster bought the rights to distribute in bookstore. When I visited Amazon last week I spent time with people in every department of publishing. They all spoke about Hugh\'s success but also about the successes of many authors now choosing the self-publishing route. Persistence is a magic power. Again: "If one reader liked my novels then it\'s worth it". He quit his full time job. He writes full time. I am sure Hugh\'s "I did" list is much greater than his "to-do" list. He answers emails. He has to deal with the business now of being a writer. He came on my podcast. He writes a blog. He analyzes data about self-publishing versus traditional publishing. He approves covers and goes over his royalties I am assuming. But every day he writes. Pick your one thing. Do it. Share it if you can. And at the end of the day or week, write your "I Did" list. Life doesn\'t have to die in the cubicle. Weave magic out of the hidden silences in between meetings. Create your one thing a day. Good or bad. Who cares? You\'ll get better. And then shout as loud as you can, "I DID IT!"So let me know in the comments...what was on your "I Did" list today?Read More:How To Be a Slave The One Thing I Remind Myself of All Day '

S' I have done all of these ten things and seen the results. I was very unhappy.Before I can give you the rules I must establish my credentials.I have started about 20 businesses and failed at 17 of them. I have failed as a husband, as have many.I hope I don\'t fail as a parent but certainly some people would look at my track record and say, "yes, yes indeed, he failed as a parent."I\'m not the best boyfriend. One time I broke up with a girlfriend while I was on the elevator up to meet her her in her apartment. I just hit the down button and never spoke to her again.But I also have had a few successes. Do I wish I had known these sooner? I don\'t know. I don\'t have a window into alternate realities. But I hope maybe other people\'s futures can be helped. HERE IS WHAT FAILURES DO:1) THEY BELIEVE IN THE WORD \'FAILURE\'We dont live long enough to fail. Like if a planet is around for 4 billion years and produces no life-forms, I would call that planet a failure.Everything else is an experiment.Thomas Edison never said, I failed 10,000 times before I made a lightbulb."The guy was in a LABORATORY. He experimented. And now everyone gets into failure porn and says "I\'m a failure". Thats BS!John Coltrane didnt fail when he couldnt stay in Miles Davis quartet.He was experimenting with Miles Davis style but ultimately, with 20 years of practice and study under his belt, he knew that only his unique style could survive and flourish in his own quartet.He experimented, learned from the experiment and moved on.HERE is the key on experimenting:THE MORE MISTAKES YOU MAKE THE BETTER YOU GET.Why is this? It\'s brain science: when you make a mistake, you repeat and repeat until you get it right.This repetition is "practice". Practice makes perfect.People who just get it right the first time (e.g. when I sold my first business) never learn all the subtleties you learn with practice.So they get fooled into thinking that "luck" equals "good" when actually "mistakes + repetition = good".2) FAILURES "UNDER PROMISE AND OVER DELIVER."Everybody is told a lie: to be a success you have to under promise and over deliver.This is the worst form of lack of integrity. The idea is that you are safe. Lets say you under promise and you under deliver.You think, incorrectly, hey, at least I have my integrity intact.No, you have nothing intact. You are just like everyone else. There are 3,000,000,000 employees on the planet and they are all under promising and most of them are under delivering.You are just like them.You have to: OVER PROMISE AND OVER DELIVEROver-promise sets you apart from the people who under-promise. Over-deliver sets you apart from people who just delivered.It\'s not that hard to do both. (It\'s easy to slightly over promise and slightly over deliver because nobody else is doing it).Try it and you will see the results. its amazing.3) PEOPLE WHO FAIL SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF ACCIDENTSThey left their important project on the subway. They are sick.Their dog got sick. They broke up with their girlfriend or boyfriend. Theres a way to minimize accidents and its called health.You cant succeed if you are sick in bed. You cant succeed if you spent all night the night before reading your wifes emails because you cant trust her.You cant succeed if you arent grateful for being given at least the chance to be something better than what you are now.When someone consistently has a lot of excuses for why something has gotten done, I know they are not ready for the next step.When I was young, I was the man with the excuses. I had them every day. I was a master of them. But I fooled nobody. And so I was given less opportunities for success.And you know what: I was right! If Im reading my wifes email and shes cheating on me, I deserve to fail.So heres what you do: You cant be perfect.But every day: Move, Eat, SleepWellImprove your relationships (Call a friend, surprise a spouse, be kind to your kids)Be creative (only you know how to do this but at least write 10 random ideas a day)Be grateful for where you are. (and this is the Now that people brag about)4) FAILURES DONT TAKE IT THE NEXT LEVELBobby Fischer always took it to the next level. Nobody ever thought he was the greatest talent in chess history. He probably had average talent. But he always said, "how can I take chess to the next level". When he was a kid he learned Russian so he could read the Russian chess magazines. After that, he never lost a US Championship. He was 13 years old. He was so much better than the Americans he even stopped playing in the US championship. And he took it to the next level right up until the world championship. For the first time in his life he played a different first move.His opponent, the older world champion had ONLY prepared for the one move Fischer ever did. So Fischer came up an entire new opening with a new first move. Gandhi took it to the next level. Every revolution before him was done with violence. He experimented. He had a vision. He felt that 300 milllion Indians didnt need to do violence. He was right, despite everyone disagreeing with him. Take the advice of everyone around you, and then take it to the next level. Practice taking it to the next level (because at first you wont be good). Come up with your ideas but then think, "What has never been done before" (it\'s not true that everything has been done before. Only shadows of things have been done before). But do it over and over again and you will be THAT PERSON that knows how to take things above and beyond. 5) FAILURES TAKE ALL THE CREDITFailures are insecure. When they do their little stupid thing at work they want the credit. Give others credit all the time. Then you are the source of credit. Just like a bank. When people want more credit, who do they go to? They go to you! Just like they would go to the bank when they need more money. Credit is like currency. If you\'re the bank, then in the long run you will end up with all the real credit. 6) LACK OF INTEGRITYI dont mean be honest. Thats obvious. How do you take honesty and integrity to the next level? You become vulnerable. You admit mistakes before you have to. You offer people their money back when you\'ve lost it and didnt have to. I was talking to Ev Williams who started Twitter. When his older company, Odeo, wasn\'t working out - he and his board decided to give everyone their money back before moving on. That\'s integrity. Nobody has ever given me my money back. You give advice and help people when you sincerely want them to do better. Do this every day. It adds up. No, it doesn\'t add up. It multiplies. It compounds. Theres negative integrity and positive integrity. Negative integrity is saying to your boss: I failed because I missed the train. Positive integrity is, I like your idea for A, B, C reasons but how about you give a chance to X, Y, and Z and I bet we can make your idea a huge success to your boss. And then you give your boss total credit. Remember, these rules dont live in isolation. Its all one big rule. Its all about you being a vessel for a vision. People live for 75 years on average. But a vision can live for millenia. 7) NO MONEY MANAGEMENTI thought there was only ONE rule about money: making it. So I lose it all. Because first I had to learn there are three rules to money:Making it. Keeping it. Growing it. Making it is what we deal with for a long time. We need to pay the bills. We need to reduce money anxiety in life. But many people who are failures think that once they make it, the job is over. I thought my job was over when I had millions in the bank. So I stopped being healthy. So I stopped being nice to the people around me. So I spent money on a penthouse apartment and buoght art and got a house in Atlantic City and started gambling after taking helicopters back and forth. So I put money in every investment possible just to impress people. And then I had $143 left and I was dead broke and blame myself for the deaths of at least two people. When you make money, keep it. Dont even invest it. Put it in the bank. Dont be greedy for more. You only need to get rich once. Unless you want to buy a basketball team you dont need to get rich twice. And only when you are confident you can Keep it, you can THINK about growing it. But that takes a year or two first of keeping it. Please trust me on this one. Almost every failure I know (and I know a lot) didnt fail because they couldnt make money. They are broke now because they couldn\'t keep it. 8) NO FOLLOW THROUGHI have a very good friend who is a brilliant brilliant scientist. Maybe the most brilliant man I know. I would tell him this to his face: you have no follow through. He has an idea. Everyone says its amazing! AMAZING! You are so SMART! He gets about 30% of it done. And then he is on to the next Brilliant idea. BRILLIANT! His kids live on food stamps. And every single one of his ideas is not just a million dollar idea. But a TRILLION dollar idea. Im not exaggerating. But he cant follow through. The next idea is always bigger. Thomas Edison didnt say, I did it! when he made the light bulb. He called up the mayor of New York and worked out a deal to light up downtown New York City. The first city in history to be lit up at night by electricity. He got paid for that. He made a company. He followed through. He got rich. That\'s the difference between Edison and Tesla, who was probably smarter in every way than Edison but died penniless. If you have trouble following through, delegate. But dont forget the other rules above: Over deliver. Integrity. Health. etc. 9) THEY DONT HAVE NOTEBOOKS I carry at all times a waiters pad. I have over 100 waiters pads. In my pocket right now is one. In the table next to where I sleep is one. Saul Bellow once said, you never have to rewrite what you write in the middle of the night. How many times do you think of a great idea and you think, this is so GREAT I will never forget it and then you forget it. It happened to me this morning. Claudia and I were talking last night and she said, You have to write this down! and I said, there is NO WAY Im going to forget this. Well, I forgot it. I pray to the gods of memory I will remember it but I forgot it. 10) THEY DONT LISTENI say, on average, 10,000 words a day. I ALREADY know the things Im going to say. They already got to my brain somehow. And now I\'m just waiting to vomit them out. When you listen, you learn. When you learn, you get better. When you get better you start to have a vision, you start to over deliver, you get more creative, and all the other good things above. Im going on a word diet. 2500 words a day. MAX. I might not succeed (its an experiment) but Im hoping I learn more today. And tomorrow. Listening is a form of giving credit. It means you value the words of other. Listening is a form of integrity. Because everyone offers something, you acknowledge that. Listening is a form of improving relationships with others. Listening is a way to outsource good ideas since if you let many others talk, some of them will give you good ideas you might not have thought of. Buddha didnt start a major religion by talking. It started because he sat under a tree and listened. Jesus spent 40 days in a desert. Listening. Moses listened to his wife (err.I mean a burning bush). Everything that has moved history happened because of listening instead of talking. Talking inspires. But listening creates the inspiration. I can say break all of the above rules is the final rule. But Im not going to say that. You know why? Because this is not bullshit. This is not about how to fail or to succeed. You can read those rules in a birthday card.This is how I failed and succeeded. I hope I can die now without any more pain.MORE FROM JAMES ALTUCHERRecommended Blog Post: The 9 Ways To Guarantee Success. I really blew it and everyone knows it.

S' My most popular book, Choose Yourself! sold 44,294 copies in its first month out, hit the Wall Street Journal Bestseller list, was #1 on Amazon for all non-fiction books for a few days and is still flirting with #1 in its various categories. This post is about what I did differently, why I did it differently, and how I think anyone can do this to self-publish a bestseller. I describe all the numbers, who I hired and why, and how I made the various choices I did.In January, 2012, I wrote that every entrepreneur should self-publish a book, because Self-Publishing Your Own Book is the New Business Card.If you want to stand out in a world of content, you need to underline your expertise. Publishing a book is not just putting your thoughts on a blog post. Its an event. It shows your best curated thoughts and it shows customers, clients, investors, friends, and lovers, what are the most important things on your mind right now.Unfortunately, most people suck at it. Ive largely sucked at it. Ive published 11 books  5 with traditional publishers, and six that are self-published.The distinction now is no longer between traditional publishing versus self-publishing. The disctinction now is between PROFESSIONAL versus UNPROFESSIONAL publishing. My first ten books were done unprofessionally. Even the ones with the big publishing houses. They will probably hate me now. I hope not. I really like the people I worked with at these publishers.I hope that everyone self-publishes. The benefits are enormous:A) more money.Unless you are a John Grisham or EL James you will make much more money by PROFESSIONALLY self-publishing. Its not just money on sales but also foreign rights and special packages that you can offer if you control all the rights to your work. Packages that the traditional publishers almost never go for.B) control over design. Traditional publishers usually keep that control.C) speed. You will probably speed up your publication date by over a year or more if you self-publish.D) content control. My bet is close to 100% of the people reading this post have content in them strong enough for a book. But 22 year old interns at publishing companies wont recognize that content. Even the editors, the publishers, the marketing guys  most of them  will not recognize the message you have to offer. Which leads me toE) Avoiding bad things in life. I hate getting that feeling of, I hope he or she chooses me for X. Where X could be an investment, an acquisition, publishing a book, buying my product, whatever. I try to limit this feeling in my life whenever possible. When you have to deal with more and more layers of people who have to choose you, you dont get the opportunity to choose yourself (!), which is infinitely more valuable.ENTER PUBLISHING 3.0: HOW TO PROFESSIONALLY SELF-PUBLISH YOUR NEXT BOOK Heres what I did step by step with my latest book for the first month since publication.1) Build your platform.A traditional publisher is not even going to look at you unless you have your own platform which means: Twitter following, Facebook following and/or a significant blog following. But if you already can hand-deliver the customers, what do you need the traditional publisher for?Wasnt that supposed to be what the publishers would get for you? Dont they get you in bookstores? The answer is no.Bookstores take very few of the books published by publishers. And whenever you see a book facing forward, or on the front table, or a staff pick that means the publisher usually paid to have that special placement. Most books dont get this. And if you dont get that, chances are your books wont sell.2) How do you build your platform?Have an honest voice. Dont be afraid to say things about either yourself or your industry. Provide unique perspective.If it doesnt bleed it doesnt lead. Make sure every post or video you do bleeds from the heart, entertains, and educates. In that order.How do you get traffic? Blog on bigger sites that aggregate bloggers or podcasts or whatever. It takes time to build up. But sincere voices will always rise to the top.3) Write. This is not a post about writing or how to write a good book. The assumption is that you will write a good book. BUT, two tips: write 500-2000 words every day to keep exercising the writing muscle. And read good writers every day. Then you will write an even better book.A typical book is anywhere from 40,000-80,000 words. So if you can average 1000 words a day, seven days a week, you can write four to eight books a year. Or one very very good, edited, revised, professional one. Or ten! Knock yourself out!I also wanted a high quality foreword for the book. I was really grateful that Dick Costolo, CEO of Twitter, agreed to do mine. I realize why he used to be an improv comedian when I read what he wrote.4) Know what you want. If you are self-publishing then you can publish your book right now without any other effort. Go to Createspace (owned by Amazon), check the box that you want to be both paperback and Kindle (it costs an extra $69 to be on kindle), pick a cover, upload your manuscript, and in a few days you will be published on Amazon and people can start buying your book.If your goal is to have a published book and use it to get customers, consulting gigs, speaking gigs, etc. or a beginning set of readers for your next book, then by all means publish this way. Its the fastest way to do it. I highly recommend it.But if your goal is to put out the best possible product, maximize the money you make, and get the most readers, then follow the next steps. What follows is what I call Publishing 3.0.1.0 was publishing with a traditional publisher.2.0 was when the stigma of self-publishing went away and an entire new artistic outlet was open to millions of people (15 million books published last year versus 300,000 ten years ago). Its cheap, quick, and easy to get your book published.3.0 is starting right now  where you can self-publish better, more successfully, better edited, better designed, better marketed, and make more money than if you go any other route. The reason this is possible only now is because for the first time, the best editors, designers, marketers are no longer working at the big publishing houses. Instead, they are striking out on their own and independently charging for their services. The demand is there. This route is more expensive than publishing 2.0 but is much more lucrative.5) Editing. Previously my editing was to just a spell check. And that was more than some of my mainstream publishers did. My wife asked me if I was kidding on this. But I told her to read my second book and she didnt question this. So in other words, it was awful.With my latest book, Choose Yourself!, I went all out. I hired two copy editors to go through the basics on spelling and grammar. Then I hired Command Z Editing, run by Nils Parker to help me structurally edit, i.e. do the job that editors used to do (example: Maxwell Perkins in the 1930s) but have been sorely lacking in the past 20 years from traditional publishers. Nils has previously edited bestsellers from Tucker Max, Kamal Ravikant, Ryan Holiday, and a dozen writers as well as written screenplays, books, etc.I am not saying hire Nils by the way. Im just saying this is who I used (and paid). Make sure who you use is among the best in the world. Else you arent taking advantage of what the Publishing 3.0 world has to offer. Nils and I went back and forth on over 15 different rewrites for my book. The difference between the original version and the final version is like the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.And yes, publishers have editors. Some very good ones. But I specifically wanted to choose my own editor and use an editor that has worked on books that have sold millions of copies. The entire idea of Publishing 3.0 is that I am not limited to who is on the publishers staff but I can pick the absolute best people in the industry. With millions of books out there, the competition is incredible. As my friend, Srinivas Rao puts it, I had to build a small army to create the best possible product. Hiring the best editor, design firm, marketing firm, and audio firms were all part of that. Not just the best around but who I felt were the best in the world.6) Design.I never liked any of the designs on my traditionally published books but I had no control over them. I dont mean this to sound so anti-publisher. But they were busier with bigger authors than me and I dont think they were always willing to devote resources to me.I made sure I put out a product I could be proud of. I used Erin Tyler Design who helped me find the right cover designer and she also managed the interior design process, which was a lot trickier than I thought. She designed the spine, picked the fonts, designed the inside flaps, the back cover, and all the quirks, tables, pictures, asides, etc inside the book and then helped format for when I uploaded to Kindle Direct on Amazon.7) Audiobook. I was at a dinner that Amazon had for self-published authors last October.One guy who was making a solid living self-publishing science fiction novels told me that he always made an audiobook. I thought that was a horrible idea, and told him so.But two things about audiobooks:He said, When people see you have an audiobook, they see your book as even more credible. It stands out from the average self-published book when you have an ebook, a print version, and an audiobook. Plus, the audio book is more expensive, so even though there are fewer sales, its decent money. By the way, if you self-publish, always do a print book at the very least. Even if 99% of your sales are going to be ebook.I asked the head of an ad agency what marketing tips he had for for my upcoming book. He said, first thing, Make an audiobook. For your kind of book, people will love listening to it while they drive into work.So Claudia, my wife who has been supportive of every aspect of this effort, set up her office in our house to be a mini-recording studio. I wrote to Tucker Max that I was going to make an audiobook. He wrote back:James, where are you doing the audio, and whos editing it? Please tell me you arent just doing it yourself with your Mac and a mic you bought online.We looked at our Mac and a mic that we had just bought online and decided to go to a professional studio. Tucker suggested John Marshall Media . They had done audiobooks ranging from President Clintons autobiography to the Harry Potter books to Freakonomics.It was a thoroughly annoying experience but was worth it.I felt uncomfortable just sitting there for eight hours reading words I had written. For one thing, it hurt. Reading for eight straight hours was killing my throat.Second, I didnt want to just read stories I had already written. So I did it totally unabridged and improvised quite a bit, making it somewhat original compared to the book.But the best reason for doing the audiobook is it forces you to really look at your writing and hear what works and what doesnt. I rewrote about 20% of the book after reading things that didnt quite sound right out loud.So, it was another round of edits (with the help of Nils) to improve the book, a process I never wouldve gone through if I hadnt done the audio version.8) Title.This deserves its own category. I had total control over the title. My first choice for the book was The Choose Yourself Era. But whenever anyone asked me to say the title I had trouble saying it. Era sounds like Error. One person asked me if it was going to a book about archaealogy. So somehow it wasnt working.So I picked ten titles that I liked, combined them with the cover and created Facebook ads that I sent out to all my friends and friends of friends in the US. Then I sat back and watched the click-thrus. After a few days and thousands of click-thrus I had my title.The Choose Yourself Era came in a distant 3rd place. Pick Yourself! was right above it in second place. And Choose Yourself! came in first by far.I then took the same Facebook approach to pick the subtitle and the final version of the cover.9) Marketing. I used Ryan Holidays company Brasscheck. Ryan was/is the head of marketing for American Apparel, and has marketed many bestsellers including books by Tim Ferriss (The Four Hour Chef), Robert Greene (Mastery), Tucker Max (I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell), and others.I had never before used an outside agency, always trusting either my own basic platform or a publisher. What Ryan provided was unbelievable. Between his rolodex and mine we scheduled about 60 podcasts, radio interviews, speaking engagements, and guest posts on popular blogs and websites.Additionally, other things that I would not have been able to coordinate: A reddit AMA that got over 3000 comments and probably close to a million views over the past month. His company created a slideshare presentation that became the most viewed slideshare on the site the week of the launch with over 300,000 views. My schedule the month after launch was non-stop marketing. I was burnt out by the end of the month.Other marketing ideas:I had become a fan of bitcoin. So I set up bitcoin.chooseyourself.us a month before I released the book and became the first book ever pre-released solely on bitcoin. Ryan then got several key media sources to cover this.I also wanted to market an offer I was making in the beginning of the book. My goal was not to necessarily make the most money but to make sure the message got out to as many people as possible.On the very first page of the book, before the editorial information and dedication, there is the offer.I offer to pay people back for the book if they could prove to me they both bought it and read it. Then I would pay them back completely for the book (losing money on each transaction because of the cut Amazon takes plus shipping). The idea was: I would be happy to give the book for free, but I know people dont value things they get for free. And I also know most people dont read the books they buy. Hence the offer.Ryan was successful at making sure that the offer itself was covered in various media outlets.Brasscheck also scripted the video trailer which was produced and animated by Simplifim. I describe the results of the marketing below.10) Foreign Rights. I found with my prior books that the traditional publishers would more or less wait for foreign publishers to call and then they would sell the rights and my split would be minimal.Typically the split was 50-50 but out of my 50 would come my agents split. I was competing with too many of the other authors in the publishers stable to get any attention from foreign publishers.Now I own all the rights to my book. Most people who self-publish arent thinking foreign rights. You still have to have someone who is going to be your advocate with the foreign publishers. So I got a foreign rights agency, 2 Seas Agency, to handle all of the foreign rights on a commission basis. They go to book conferences all over the world and have connections in each country.In June, the first month the book was out, Marleen Seegers from 2 Seas sold rights to: Brazil (USD 2500), China (USD 4300), Korea (USD 5000). She is currently in negotiations with publishers from ten other countries. The three mentioned above are where the contracts were finished blindingly fast.11) Other merchandise.Since I own the rights I can do whatever I want. Below in the Numbers section I describe a bundle I put together combining a hardcover version of the book with three earlier books plus some original writing that was sent out by an e-newsletter company that did all of the fulfillment and split the proceeds with me.With the help of The Social Pages and Litographs I also made a poster that is designed like the cover of the book when you look from afar but when you get close to it you see clearly all 67,000 words of the book. Im also making that into a shirt. What will I do with it? I have no idea. But its fun and I wanted to do it.In the below photos you can see the far away version and the words when you are standing about an inch from the poster.12) The numbers. First off, what were my prior numbers.Here are my advances on my first mainstream-published five books in order: $5,000, $7500, $30,000, $100,000, and $30,000. Advances are coming down quickly!My first book made back my advance and with about a 10% royalty I probably made another few thousand dollars on it. None of my other books came close to making back their advances.On my first five self-published books I dont have all the numbers but I gave an enormous number of books away for free in order to build up my readership. Almost all of those books I produced for free but my revenues were minimal even though I had many readers for them.In the first week Choose Yourself! was out I got onto the WSJ Bestsellers List with about 10,000 copies sold. To hit the New York Times bestseller list I can tell you anecdotally (and it depends on the week) that you need about 2500  3000 copies sold in your first week. I couldnt get on the NYT Bestsellers List because they do not look at books that do not appear in bookstores. Im not in any bookstores at the moment although Im working on ways that can change. Suffice to say I wouldve hit that list as well as the WSJ list.Altogether in the first month I sold 44,294 copies between my paperback, audio, ebook, and even hardcover versions. The hardcover version was sold via an email newsletter run by Porter Stansberry that bundled the hardcover with 3 free versions of my past books plus an original report written by me. He split the proceeds 50-50 with me after the cost of the hardcover was recovered. I sold about 20,000 through this method in the first month. Of the remaining 24,000, close to 50% was Kindle, 45% was Createspace and 5% was Audible. On all the Amazon Kindle sales the royalty is 70% of the $4.99 cost. On the Audible version the royalty is approximately 52%, give or take a few percent. On Createspace the royalty given my pricing was about 26%.The total cost of everything described above was $31,000, not counting traveling I did for the marketing and other marketing costs involved in building my platform.Related posts:33 Unusual Tips to Being a Better Writer Why and How I Self-Published a Book '

I was so scared I didnt know what to do.I would do anything, even pray to a god I didnt believe in, in a house of worship that I didnt feel welcome in, and asking for something that prayer was never intended for.Someone asked me yesterday. what do you feel strongly about?I said, nothing.He said thats a strong response. Dont you worry about death?I said, Why waste any part of today worrying about something that will happen later?Today Pope Francis arrives at St. Patricks in NYC. My guess is his motives will be loftier than mine. But I dont know. Maybe he wants money also.So I did some research. God or not, religion or not, Catholic or not, I try to learn from everyone.Heres what I love about Pope Francis on this holiest of Jewish holidays, Yom Kippur. And I dont believe in the sanctity of either.A) HE LIVES IN A STUDIOWhen Pope Francis traveled to the Vatican for his inauguration he stayed in a hotel that he paid for himself.And rather than move into the lavish 12-bedroom residence all prior popes live in, he chose a small studio with no staff.Rather than mimic him, its interesting to just ask why? and think about it.What is the example he wants to live by?B) CUBAPope Francis wrote letters to Barack Obama and Raul Castro, encouraging them to get together.Thats why we now have relations one again with Cuba, after 50 years.Biologically were one species. But politically, for thousands of years weve divided up by false and artificial borders.Imagine a world with no borders. Where trade and innovation flourishes. Where friendship and kindness can transcend ethnic and religious differences.A world with no more arguing on daytime talk shows.C) HE TOOK A SELFIESee the photo. A bunch of teenagers approached him. Asked him for a photo. And they took a selfie.He doesnt put himself on a pedestal (he drives a Kia instead of the previous popemobile). He wants to show that we all have the potential for direct happiness.During the time of Jesus, there was no Pope obviously.In fact, Jesus said, The kingdom of God is within you.Jesus was speaking to the Jewish layman of the time. But now he might even say, the choice for freedom is within you, and not anyone else.And thats why the Pope takes a selfie.Quote from him: Depicting the Pope as a sort of Superman, a star, is OFFENSIVE to me. The pope is a man who laughs, cries, sleeps calmly and has friends like everyone else. A normal person.D) HE MAKES PHONE CALLSTwo years ago, a young woman was pressured by her husband to have an abortion. She said, no, and got divorced.She was depressed. She wrote the Pope.A few weeks later the phone rang. She picked it up.Hello, the other side said, its Pope Francis. He comforted her and then baptized the newborn when it was born.He regularly makes calls to the people who write him, shedding the layers of bureaucracy that have existed for almost 2000 years in the Vatican.How often we forget the immense benefits a simple touch makes.The most impressive display of beauty is not the Sistine Chapel, with God reaching to grasp the first man but a man reaching out to touch a single woman who needed help.How many of us do that simple act, the creation of art and beauty, every day? I dont. But I should.D) HE HATES THE NEWSThe media only writes about the sinners and the scandals, but thats normal, because a tree that falls makes more noise than a forest that grows.The media sells subscriptions. But every day we have a choice. To focus on what is growing in our lives, or the negativity and fear that try to bring us down.Another quote: How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure but it is news when the stock market loses two points?E) THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF MANThere are something like 8 million species on Earth. We always think of ourselves as somehow king of the food chain.Maybe we are and maybe we arent. After all, we made the definition of the phrase food chain so why not make ourselves king of it.Certainly many species are not even aware of us.Nor is it so great that we are supposedly, intelligent. How many high IQ people are truly happy and free and live every day with well-being.Francis quote: No one can grow if he does not accept his smallness.F) HE TEACHES PEOPLE TO CHOOSE THEMSELVESWe know that happiness is not related to money. Countless studies have shown this.Often its related to our mindset. To the choices we make. Again, when someone asked me why not worry about tomorrow, there is no real answer. Why should I?Francis quote: This is the struggle of every person: be free or be a slave.Even if you are stuck at the bottom of solitary confinement in jail, you can still choose to be free inside your spirit.This is not self-help BS. This is your choice: do you be miserable or do you root yourself in your inner freedom? Why choose to be miserable?And yet, often when I wake up in the morning, all my past memories suck me in as quickly as possible and its an effort not to say ugh.Then I'm a slave again. Its a practice every day to choose freedom.G) HE SECRETLY READS MY EMAILSHis quote: Living together is an art. Its a patient art, its a beautiful art, its fascinating.How does he know that Claudia and I recently had a horrible argument.It was so painful. I couldnt even function for days. We dont argue a lot and when we do I feel like my heart bursts open.Do you ever feel like that? Like you argue with someone and the only way out of it is to crawl into a cave. To disappear and not even think until the storm seems to pass.But it does pass. And you figure your way through the maze to find a greater intimacy.I dont brag about it. I hate arguing. I dont ever want to. Id honestly rather have less intimacy in my life than argue to find greater intimacy.But when its there I do feel like we just made a work of art.H) HE DOESNT TEACH FEARFor all I know he is an atheist. I cant find one quote from him about hell or damnation.In my view (and I may be wrong, it doesnt matter to me) he uses the word god as a placeholder for well-being.Many studies show that the key to contentment and confidence is three things:Growing competence in a pursuit you loveStrengthening every day the relationships around youIncreasing your freedom of choices3Quote from the Pope: If we start without confidence, Already we have lost half the battle and we bury our talents.I) HE THINKS LIKE THE DALAI LAMAA friend of mine who is a believer in Tibetan Buddhism and has spent much time with the Dalai Lama once told me this: when you are with the Dalai Lama you feel as if he loves you the way a mother loves her baby.Quote from Francis: To protect every man and every woman, to look upon them with tenderness and love, is to open up a horizon of hope. It is to let a shaft of light break through the heavy clouds; it is to bring the warmth of hope!J) LIVE BY EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF PREACHINGImagine youve had a hard day at your construction site. You finally get a break, sit down with your friends, and break out your lunch.A man walks by. Hes tired also from his job. He leaves the crowd surrounding him and asks you and your friends if he can join you for lunch.He pulls out his lunchbox also and starts eating and talking to you.He lives in a simple studio, drives a simple car, and refuses all gifts anyone gives him.Hes the Pope and this happened.Quote: These two criteria are like the pillars of true love: deeds, and the gift of self.He doesnt just say it. He lives it.It doesnt matter if you are Jewish on the holiest day of the year. It doesnt matter if you are an atheist. It doesnt matter if you are Christian, or Catholic.Pope Francis lives a message. I wish every day I could try to live closer to that same message.K) HIS NAME IS HIS ENTIRE BELIEF SYSTEMHe chose the name Francis when he became Pope because of Francis of Assisi. How come?He explains:Francis of Assisi loved, helped and served the needy, the sick and the poor; he also cared greatly for creation.To me, this is the entire belief system of Pope Francis. He did not use the words god or jesus or spirit above.This is all anyone needs to transform a life of fear and stress and anxiety and regret into a life of well-being and happiness.Sometimes I think Im not a good person. Sometimes I look at people on the street and hate them for no reason. Sometimes Im not as good as I could be to family or friends.But Im trying to be better. I hope every day I can wake up and remind myself of Franciss exact words above.To care greatly for creation is the essence of choosing yourself instead of letting anyone else do it for you.Instead of being held back by judgments or anger or fear or regret.Maybe one day I will be able to live in a studio, call people who need help, eat lunch with strangers, take selfies with whoever.For now, I write blog posts. And maybe tomorrow Ill die.Read More: How To Live ForeverHow to be THE LUCKIEST GUY ON THE PLANET in 4 Easy Steps"

S' When was the last time you felt like this little boy?Ive spent the past 20 years worrying about money. Worrying about what other people thought of me. Worrying about relationships, love, loss. Awkward about people, places, things, agendas Agendas. Thinking about the people who were angry at me. Obsessing on the people I was angry at. Scared to fail. Afraid to adventure. Thinking I had to achieve goals to alchemize unhappiness into happiness. Thinking I had to be the smartest person in the meeting, the room, the building, the city, thinking that the only way to I could ever be HAPPY was to get away far away far far away fromHEREjust so I could getTHEREin the land of the goals. In the land of the motivations. In the land of success."What a waste.Now I hear the birds chirping, its not yet 5am. If I can picture it for a second  being a young boy, smiling, I have my bread. Picture what is in the eyes of that boy. Picture those are your eyes. Feel that moment of flight through the air, society hasnt yet given me my orders, my goals. Im free to run, to enjoy, to relax. Yesterday is long gone. Tomorrow will never come. Im happy today, with my bread, with my smile, with both feet flying in the air. Like a bird. Like nothing Ive ever felt before.For the briefest of moments happiness is the absence of everything that has happened to me ever since.Read More:The One Thing I Remind Myself of All Day - Altucher ConfidentialThe One Thing That Increases My Happiness'

S' The way to have good ideas is to get close to killing yourself. Its like weightlifting. When you lift slightly more than you can handle, you get stronger.In life, when the gun is to your head, you either figure it out, or you die.When you cut yourself open, you bleed ideas. If youre broke and close to death, you have to start coming up with ideas.If you destroy your life, you need to come up with ideas to rebuild it.The only time Ive been FORCED to have good ideas is when I was up against the wall. My life insurance policy was like a gun to my head: Come up with good ideas OR ELSE your kids get your life insurance!At an airport when I realized a business I had been working on for four years was worthless.Or when I was sitting in the dark at three in the morning in the living room of the house I was going bankrupt and losing my home, my brain figuring out how to die without anyone knowing it was planned.Or when I was getting a divorce and I was lonely and afraid I wouldnt make any money again or I wouldnt meet anyone again. Or my kids would hate me. Or my friends would be disgusted by me.The problem is this: youre NOT in a state of panic most of the time. States of panic are special and have to be revered. Think about the times in your life that you remember  its exactly those moments when you hit bottom and were forced to come up with ideas, to get stronger, to connect with some inner force inside you with the outer force.This is why its important NOW to strengthen that connection to that idea force inside of you. This post is about HOW.Nothing you ever thought of before amounted to anything  thats why you are exactly where you are at that moment of hitting bottom. Because all of your billions of thoughts have led you to right there. You cant trust the old style of thinking anymore. They came, they saw, they lost.You have to come up with a new way of thinking. A new way of having ideas. A new ways of interacting with the outside universe.Youre in crisis. Time to change. Time to become an IDEA MACHINE.People know what runners high is. Its when you are running for a long time, at the point of exhaustion, and then something kicks in and gives you a second wind.400,000 years ago people didnt jog for exercise. They didnt even have jogging shorts. Or sneakers.400,000 years ago people need to eat and live. And either youre running to catch a prey, or you are running from a lion. Youre the prey! And you need that second wind in both cases or you DIE.The same thing happens in the brain. When you are about to die, a second wind kicks in. Ideas, experiences, opportunity, and probably hidden forces and neurochemicals we dont understand.But you cant get runners high unless youre ALREADY in good shape. Unless you are already able to run long distances.This is why its important to exercise the idea muscle right now. If your idea muscle atrophies, then even at your lowest point you wont have any ideas.How long does it take this muscle to atrophy? The same as any other muscle in your body: just two weeks without having any ideas. Atrophied.If you lie down in a bed for two weeks and dont move your legs you will need physical therapy to walk again.Many people need idea therapy. Not so that they can come up with great ideas right this second (although maybe you will) but so that people can come up with ideas when they need them: when their car is stuck, when their house blows up, when they are fired from their job, when their spouse betrays them, when they go bankrupt or lose a big customer, or lose a client, or go out of business, or get sick.IDEAS ARE THE CURRENCY OF LIFE. Not money. Money gets depleted until you go broke. But good ideas buy you good experiences, buy you better ideas, buy you better experiences, buy you more time, save your life. Financial wealth is a side effect of the runners high of your idea muscle.Whoah! That was a big intro. Depending on where I post this, some people will write tl;dr which I had to look up and it means too long, didnt read. I encourage those people to stop reading here and save yourself the trouble. Its ok. Im not mad at you. Ill write smaller articles also. Ill even draw cartoons.Ive often written about the idea muscle as part of what I call my daily practice. Every day I have to check the box on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health.And I get a lot of questions about it so I will try and answer them here. If you have more questions, ask in the comments and I will answer.Sometimes people ask, did you only start coming up with ideas because you already had it made?ANSWER: I was on the floor crying because I was dead broke and dead lonely and had no prospects so thats why I had to do it.So now, 1000 words in (tl;dr) The Ultimate Cheat Sheet for Becoming an Idea MachineThe below is what I do and what works for me. If you have anything to add, please add them in the comments, I need all the help I can get.A) WHAT DO YOU MEAN  IDEA MACHINE?You will be like a superhero. Its almost a guaranteed membership in the Justice League of America.Every situation you are in, you will have a ton of ideas. Any question you are asked, you will know the response. Every meeting you are at, you will take the meeting so far out of the box youll be on another planet, if you are stuck on a desert highway  you will figure the way out, if you need to make money youll come up with 50 ideas to make money, and so on.After I started exercising the idea muscle, it was like a magic power had unleashed inside of me. Its ok if you dont believe me. Or maybe you think its bragging. There are many times when I dont have ideas. But thats when I stop practicing what I am about to advocate.Try it for yourself. Im not selling anything here. I have no reason for you to try this. I just want to share my exerience. Its like part of your brain is opened up and a constant flow of stuff, both good and bad, gets dropped in there.From where? I dont think about it and I dont care. But I use it.In early 2009 was one of those times when I desperately needed to do this. I was fulltime either trying to find a girlfriend or I was trying to start a business or both. I was also going broke in the stock market and losing my home (until I personally saved the entire stock market  see my book).Every night, Id have waffles for dinner and a bottle of wine and start writing ideas down. This is before I went paleo (no waffles!) and stopped drinking alcohol (five years sober!) and I was writing 10-20 of the most ludicrous ideas a day down.And you know what ? It worked.B) HOW DO I START EXERCISING THE IDEA MUSCLE?Take a waiters pad. Go to a local cafe. Maybe read an inspirational book for ten to twenty minutes. Then start writing down ideas. What ideas? Hold on a second. The key here is, write ten ideas.C) WHY A WAITERS PAD?A waiters pad fits in your pocket so you can easily pull it out to jot things down.A waiters pad is too small to write a whole novel or even a paragraph. In fact, its specifically made to make a list. And thats all you want, a list of ideas.A waiters pad is a great conversation starter if you are in a meeting. Someone at the meeting will eventually say, Ill take fries with my burger and everyone will laugh. You broke the ice and you stand out.A waiters pad is cheap. You can get about 100 for $10. This shows you are frugal and dont need those fancy moleskin pads to have a good idea.Oh, and I just found out another reason for a waiters pad while I was writing this. Someone with alcohol on his breath, a bottle in hand, looking like he could crush me with one hand, just came up to me in the cafe Im sitting at and asked for money. I held up my waiters pad and said, Can I take your order? and he said, OH! and he walked away.D) WHY TEN IDEAS?If I say, write down ten ideas for books you can write I bet you can easily write down four or five. I can write down four or five right now. But at six it starts to get hard. Hmmm, you think, what else can I come up with?This is when the brain is sweating.Note that when you exercise in the gym, your muscles dont start to build until you break a sweat. Your metabolism doesnt improve when you run until you sweat. Your body doesnt break down the old and build the new until it is sweating.The poisons and toxins in your body dont leave until you sweat.The same thing happens with the idea muscle. Somewhere around idea number six, your brain starts to sweat. This means its building up. Break through this. Come up with ten ideas.E) WHAT IF I JUST CANT COME UP WITH TEN IDEAS?Heres the magic trick: if you cant come up with ten ideas, come up with 20 ideas.F) BUT IF I CANT COME UP WITH TEN, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO COME UP WITH 20?For the obvious reason. You are putting too much pressure on yourself. Perfectionism is the ENEMY of the idea muscle. Perfectionism is your brain trying to protect you from harm. From coming up with an idea that is embarassing and stupid and could cause you to suffer pain.We like the brain. But you have to shut the brain off to come up with ideas.The way you shut the brain off is by forcing it to come up with bad ideas.So lets say youve written 5 ideas for books and they are all pretty good. And now you are stuck. How can I top this brilliant list of five!?Well, lets come up with some bad ideas. Heres one: Dorothy and the Wizard of Wall Street. Dorothy is in a hurricane in Kansas and she lands right at the corner of Broadway and Wall Street in NYC and she has to make her way all the way down Wall Street in order to find The Wizard of Wall Street (Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs) in order to get home to Kansas. Instead, he offers her a job to be a high frequency trader instead.What a bad idea! Ok, now go onto the next 15 ideas. (and it anyone wants to buy the movie rights to The Wizard of Wall Street please contact Claudia.)G) HOW DO I KNOW IF AN IDEA IS A GOOD IDEA?You wont. You dont. You cant. You shouldnt.Lets say you come up with ten ideas a day. In a year you will have come up with 3650 ideas (no breaks on weekends by the way if you want to get good at this). Maybe more if you are trying to do 20 ideas a day.Its unlikely that you came up with 3,650 good ideas (after you become an idea machine your ratio goes up but probably in the beginning your ratio of bad ideas to good is around 1000:1).Dont put pressure on yourself to come up with good ideas. The key right now is just to have good ideas. When Tiger Woods is practicing he doesnt get disappointed himself if he doesnt hit a hole in one every shot. Youre just practicing here.Practice doesnt make perfect. But practice makes permanent. So that later on when you do need good ideas to save your life, you know you will be a fountain of them.When theres a tidal wave of good ideas coming out of you, you only need a cup of water out of that to quench your thirst.H) HOW DO I EXECUTE ON MY IDEAHeres what I do often when I am writing down ideas that I think I might want to act on.I divide my paper into two columns.On one column is the list of ideas. On the other column is the list of FIRST STEPS. Remember, only the first step. Because you have no idea where that first step will take you.Imagine you are driving 100 miles to your home late at night. You turn on your headlights so you can see in front of you. All you can see is about 30 feet in front of you but you know if you have the lights on the entire time, youll make it home safely, 100 miles away.Activating the idea machine is how you turn the lights on so you can get home. But you dont need to do any more than that.One of my favorite examples: Richard Branson didnt like the service on some airline he was flying. So he had an idea: Im going to start a new airline. How the heck can a magazine publisher start an airline from scratch with no money?His first step. He called Boeing to see if they had an airplane he could lease.No idea is so big you cant take the first step. If the first step seems to hard, make it simpler. And dont worry again if the idea is bad. This is all practice.For instance, lets say one of my ideas is: I want to be a brain surgeon. My first step: I would buy a bunch of books on how to do brain surgery. I dont have to plan my whole way through medical school.Wait!? Did I just say I would be a brain surgeon without a medical degree? No. I simply had a bad idea and the first step I would take if I was going to execute on that idea. And, yes, Im absolutely confident I would be able to do successful brain surgery before someone throws me in jail (hence, the bad idea aspect of it).A real life example: In 2006 I had ten ideas for websites I wanted to build. I knew how to program but didnt want to. So my first step was to find a site like Elance and then put the spec up and find programmers in India who could make the websites for me. One of them I paid $2000 to develop and sold for $10,000,000 9 months later. (this is not bragging  I went dead broke about 2 years after that).Nine of the ten ideas were BAD. But you only need one.I) BUT IF IM COMING UP WITH BUSINESS IDEAS, HOW DO I KNOW IF IM ON THE RIGHT TRACK?Theres no way to know in advance if a business idea is a good one. For instance, Google started around 1996 but didnt make a dime of money until around 2001.Heres my favorite example. A company called Odeo was a software company to help people set up podcasts. Since I do a podcast now this seems like a great idea to me. So they raised a ton of money from professional venture capitalists.Then one of their programmers started working on a side project. The side project got a little traction but not much. But the CEO of Odeo decided to switch strategies and go full force into the side project without having a clue if it would work.He felt bad since this isnt what the investors invested in. So he called up all of the investors, some of the best investors on the planet, and described the side project to them and all the traction they were getting, etc and then made an offer, Since this is a different direction, Id be willing to buy all of your shares back so nobody will lose any money.100% of his investors said, YES! GIVE IT BACK! and so he bought all of his investors shares back. Now, Ev Williams, the founder of Twitter (which was the side project), is a billionaire as a result.Nobody knew. Nobody knows. You have to try multiple ideas and see which ones gets the excitement of customers, employees, and you can see that people are legitimately using it and excited by it.When I started Stockpickr someone once wrote me and said, please block me from the site. Im too addicted to it and its ruining my life. Thats when I had a sense that I had a halfway decent idea. And that was one of ten ideas I was trying simultaneously. The rest failed.So dont be afraid to test, fail, test, fail, try again, repeat, improve, test, fail again, and keep improving. The way to keep improving? Keep coming up with ideas for your business and for other new businesses.As your idea muscle improves, so will your ability to fail quickly. Failing quickly is a better skill than executing quickly.J) WHEN DO I SHUT DOWN AN IDEA?In 2009, I started The Leading Love Site on the Net. It was going to be a dating website where your twitter feed was your profile. Everyone I spoke to say, thats a great idea! I had already raised money and was raising more.Then, on the day I was going to close the fundraising round I woke up shaking. I had this vision of myself a year from now explaining to all of the investors why it wasnt going to work. I returned all the money. I was out the money I had spent to create the website.I can guess why it was a bad idea (people on dating sites want to be anonymous, for instance) but I didnt really know. I just knew I had to return the money.When your idea muscle is developed and the other legs of the daily practice are fully developed (Phyiscal, Emotional, Spiritual) youll have a better idea when you should shut things down. When you are shutting them down for the right reasons. When you are failing quickly as opposed to self-sabotage or fear of success or youre just stupid.That was the last time I tried to start a business. Since then Ive done very well by not starting businesses. Starting businesses is not the only way to make money in this world. There are many ways.K) HOW DO YOU KEEP TRACK OF YOUR IDEAS?I make a list of ideas and then I usually just throw them out.The whole purpose is to exercise the idea muscle. I know most of the ideas are bad ideas so I theres no sense keeping them around.If one of the ideas is good then I will probably remember it and build on it for the next day. Sometimes its kind of funny when I come across an old list of ideas to see what I was thinking. Every now and then I think I find a good idea in my old lists but its rare.And then what do I do with that rare good idea? Probably nothing.L) ARE ALL OF YOUR IDEAS BUSINESS IDEAS?No. Almost never. Its hard to come up with over 3000 business ideas a year. Im lucky if I come up with a few business ideas.The key is to have fun with it. Else you dont do it. People avoid things that are not fun.Heres some types of lists I make:IDEA SEX. Combine two ideas to come up with a better idea. Dont forget that idea evolution works much faster than human evolution. You will ALWAYS come up with better ideas after generations of idea sex. This is the DNA of all idea generation.OLD TO NEW: 10 old ideas I can make new. (Dorothy, Wall Street, etc). Similar to idea sex.10 ridiculous things I would invent (the smart toilet, etc).10 books I can write (The Choose Yourself Guide to an Alternative Education, etc).10 business ideas for Google / Amazon / Twitter / you10 people I can send ideas to10 podcast ideas I can do. Or videos I can shoot. (Lunch with James, a video podcast where I just have lunch with people over Skype and we chat).10 industries I can remove the middleman.10 Things I Disagree With that everyone else assumes is religion (college, home ownership, voting, doctors). Or, for any one of those ideas. 10 ideas why!10 ways to make old posts of mine and make books out of them10 ways I can surprise Claudia. (Actually, more like 100 ways. Thats hard work!)10 items I can put on my 10 list ideas I usually write list10 people I want to be friends with and I figure out what the next steps are to contact them (Azaelia Banks, Im coming after you! Larry Page better watch out also.)10 things I learned yesterday.10 things I can do differently today. Right down my entire routine from beginning to end as detailed as possible and change one thing and make it better.10 chapters for my next book10 ways I can save time. For instance, dont watch TV, drink, have stupid business calls, dont play chess during the day, dont have dinner (I definitely will not starve), dont go into the city to meet one person for coffee, dont waste time being angry at that person who did X, Y, and Z to you, and so on.10 Things I Learned from X. Where X is someone Ive spoke to recently or read a book by recently. Ive written posts on this about the Beatles, Mick Jagger, Steve Jobs, Bukowski, the Dalai Lama, Superman, Freakonomics, etc.Random: 10 Things Women Totally Dont Know About Men. (that turned into a list of 100 and Claudia said to me, uhhh, I dont think you should publish this).Todays list: 10 More Alternative to College I can Add to my book: 40 Alternatives to College.10 Things Im Interested in Getting Better At (and then 10 ways I can get better at each one).10 things I was interested in as a kid that might be fun to explore now. (Like, maybe I can write that Son of Dr. Strange comic Ive always been planning. And now I need 10 plot ideas).A problem I have and ten ways I might try and solve it. This has saved me with the IRS countless times. Unfortunately, the Department of Motor Vehicles is impervious to my super powers.This is just a sample. Every day, 10 ideas. The other day, 10 ways I can release more endorphins into my body. Today is, 10 ways I can help people build their idea machine. Tomorrow is 10 Ways I can turn my next book into a webinar for Oprah. The day after that: 10 things I can talk about in my next talk on May 3 (which means, developing an entire standup comedy act from scratch since I have a rule, if its not funny, then a tree fell in the forest and it didnt make a sound.)M) IS THE IDEA MUSCLE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT YOU CALL THE DAILY PRACTICE?No! They are all EQUAL.Imagine youre sitting on a stool. By the way, I only see stools in bars because you have to be drunk to sit on a stool. Its so uncomfortable. And then invariably, someone falls off a stool and then half the people laugh and half the people say is he ok? but everyone crowds around because we smell blood.So, now youre on a stool with four legs. If someone pulls away one of the legs you might still balance and the stool stays up but its tricky. If someone pulls two legs off, youre down for the count.The Daily Practice is to be: Physically, Emotionally, Mentally (the idea muscle), and Spiritually healthy.If you arent physically healthy you wont come up with ideas. Youll be coughing and vomiting.If you are around people who hate you, you wont come up with ideas. Because they will be yelling at you while you are trying to think.And if you arent feeling grateful and calm in your life on a regular basis, then you will be anxious and it will be harder to come up with ideas.So all four parts of the Daily Practice work together to come up with great ideas.N) DO I REALLY DO THIS EVERY DAY?Lets say you get tired for a day of writing ideas. Try something different. The key is to keep activating parts of your brain that have atrophied.Sometimes if I dont feel like writing down a list of ten ideas Ill do something else.Like Ill draw ten eyes.Or Ill make a collage.Or Ill take photographs of the ten most beautiful women I see today. Or the ten ugliest men (if I take picture of the ten most handsome men then I might get jealous and thats a whole other thing Id have to deal with).Or I might come make ten prank calls (well, when I was a kid I did that. I never do that now! Maybe).O) IS IT IMPORTANT TO READ BEFORE WRITING?I dont know. But I do. Heres what I do:At any given point I have about 10-20 books on my to go list. Books that I can just pop in and continue reading.Every day I read at least 10% of a non-fiction book that gives me tons of new ideas, an inspirational book, a fiction book of high-quality writing, and maybe a book on games (lately Ive been solving chess puzzles). And then I start writing.Right now the inspirational book is The Untethered Soul. The non-fiction book is Antifragile. The fiction book is Blind Date (Kosinski) and the games book is actually my chess app (Shreder) which has non-stop puzzles. But this list changes almost every day.P) HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?It takes at least six months of coming up with ideas every day before you are an idea machine.Then your life will change every six months. Ive said this before but my life is completely different than it was six months ago, and six months before that, and so on. So different there is no way I couldve predicted the differences.Six months ago I had no podcast. Now its a big part of my day. Six months before that, Choose Yourself had not come out. Six months before that, several I had not yet gone on several board seats that have done well for me. And so on.Q) DO I GIVE MY IDEAS AWAY FOR FREE?When you come up with ideas for someone else, always give ALL the ideas away for free if you think they are good ideas (remember: six months).I read recently one person said to give HALF of your ideas away for free and make them pay for the other half.This is very bad. This guarantees you will only come up with bad ideas. Because you will hoard your ideas. You will develop a SCARCITY COMPLEX around your ideas.Ideas are infinite. But once you define your capacity of good ideas (half) then they instantly become finite for you. Not for anyone else. But just for you, your ideas will be finite.If you stick to an abundance mentality, and be grateful for the ideas that are flowing through you, then they will be infinite. Where they come from, nobody knows. But they will be infinite and lucrative for you.So give ideas for free, and then when you meet, give more ideas. And if someone wants to pay you and your gut feels this is a good fit, then give even more ideas.R) I KEEP COMING UP WITH IDEAS AND THEY KEEP FAILING. WHAT DO I DO?Theres this cult of failure that has popped up recently. That you need to fail to succeed.This is not true. Failure really sucks. You dont want to fail. There is an easy way to solve this. Take the word fail out of your vocabulary.Everything we do in life is a success. We breathe, we love, we practice kindness, we deal with other human beings. We improve. We have experiences. This is magnificent and abundant success. Just even being able to try new things is something to celebrate every day. To smile at another person. To play.Most things I try to do dont work out as I planned. But who am I to predict the outcomes of my preparation. My only job is to prepare.Everybody, EVERYBODY, is a poor predictor of outcomes. From the weatherman, to the stock analyst. But we can all be good at preparation.And once I prepare, I show up at the starting line. Then the whistle blows, the race begins, I try my hardest with the most amount of integrity, and the results are not up to me.Then I go back and learn from the race, I prepare more, I love more, I celebrate more, and I shop up for the next race. The whistle blows, and eventually good things happen. Preparation leads to Faith in yourself.I used to think good things never happen. I saw my father die without anything good happening to him. I thought my fate was going to parallel his. But every moment, this moment while you are reading this, you get to choose abundance, gratitude, kindness, integrity, goodness. Only you get to choose what is in your universe.When you dont choose, you excuse.S) IS IT REALLY WORTH IT TO BECOME AN IDEA MACHINE?Every day I come up with ideas. I havent had a business since 2009. And it failed, as mentioned above.Since then Ive made more money than I know what to do with because I come up with ideas for people, for companies, for me, for people who have no idea who I am, for random anonymous things.I then get invited to share my ideas. Sometimes I get paid for them. Sometimes I give them for free. Sometimes I get more introductions to people and sometimes I get a chance to advise companies that do well and make me money. And sometimes I write books.When youre an idea machine, everything you look at breaks down into a collection of ideas, just like physical objects ultimately breakdown into collections of particles if your eyes were subatomic microscopes. Your eyes and brains become sub-idea microscopes that see the ideas that become the building blocks for everything in society.See them, build them, change them, seed them, birth them, love them, live them. Ideas are the dark matter of the universe. We know its there but only those in the know can see them.  What do you do once you become an idea machine?This is what I dont know the answer to because you are the master of your life.Now you have super powers. Now youre ready to take your unique place in the world. You will know how to get to the Justice League satellite that orbits the Earth and solves problems at a moments notice.You will know what to do. I dont know. Nobody else knows. Youll do it and the world wont be the same.Whew. That was long. If you are still interested in reading more though, you can check out some of my other posts on my site:How to be THE LUCKIEST GUY ON THE PLANET in 4 Easy Steps FAQ on How To Become an Idea Machine '

S' Jerry Seinfeld was asked by Howard Stern, why didnt you continue the series? After all, Seinfeld was being offered $100,000,000 by NBC if he agreed to just one more season.For Seinfeld everything boiled down to timing. He didnt have any special gimmicks in his act. So timing and writing was everything.In an interview with the LA Times he once said, A laugh is not just a laugh. It has different breadth, different pitch, different amplitude, and you learn to interpret what those things mean.Analyzing every detail like that is what made his comedy special. So he learned to interpret what the laughter was about for his show, the highest rated show in history.He told Howard Stern, The public wanted more. But, Howard, the public is NOT in show business. So you should do the OPPOSITE of what the public wants. Theres a reason they are not in show business.This is almost like the stock market. If everyone in the world thinks the market is going up then it means its probably going down soon. And vice versa.Everyone is the same when they die. But many people become the same as everyone else much earlier.Why die earlier than you have to?Seinfeld never followed the herd. He kept his comedy clean when nobody else was. He created a show about nothing when every other show was about something.And he went out at the top when $100,000,000 was being offered to him and everyone was begging for more.Its hard to do that. We have needs. We have bills to pay. If everyone is doing it this way then maybe this way is the right way? Its scary.So we often do things we dont really want to do. Other people, or societal myths, make our decisions. And much later, at least with me, I would start feeling stuck or depressed. I wandered off of my path and ended up on the crowded death path.At every fork in the road you have a choice. This is what I try to do now: I ask, which choice makes me feel better.Then I dont think about it. Thoughts are too biased by evolution, society, our past, our neuroses. My only job is to ask the question.Then I take a breath. Maybe more. Whats my heart say? Whats my stomach say? Eventually, if Im healthy in other ways, my body will tell me the answer. (maybe this sounds corny, but its what I do).The public is not in YOUR business. Thats why you are you. Choose the path at the fork where your heart goes on fire. Go down that path.Dont look back.Read More: The Tao of Louis CK'

S" In 2003 I really disliked Warren Buffett. Like, I personally hated him. After 9/11 he stated Were going to have something in the way of a major nuclear event in this country. It will happen. Whether it will happen in 10 years or 10 minutes, or 50 years  its virtually a certainty.Everyone on TV nodded their head. Why not. The man is bigger than Jesus. But listen, WB (we call each other by our initials when we whisper softly to each other) charges for insurance AGAINST NUCLEAR ATTACKS. If I were a door to door life insurance salesman you know what I would say to you? You can die tomorrow! Why not protect your kids just in case? And I dont like when people, even Buffett, spread nuclear panic.But I forgave him. We hugged it out. Sort of. He never met me. And he wouldnt pick up the phone the one time I called him. But I took a cab to his house. Hey, wouldnt you take a cab to his house? If you could?(my masterpiece about Buffett. And the worst cover in the history of the printing press)I went to the 2003 annual meeting in Omaha. The Buffettpalooza. I think 20,000 people were supposedly there. No exaggeration. People got on line at 5am to get into the meeting. Krispy Kreme donuts were served on the line outside. Then, when it was time to go in, everyone RAN in order to get a good seat. But since they had just cleaned the floors everyone was slipping, falling, sliding as soon as they got into the building. It was exactly what would happen if everyone was running to escape, well, a nuclear attack.The night before the meeting there were some parties.I got invited by pretending to be media. I got a special badge. One guy had some numbers written on a napkin. What do you think Berkshires intrinsic value is? he asked me. He had all the parts of Berkshire written on a napkin with numbers written next to them. If you didnt know it, this is referred to as back of the napkin investing.I met another guy who told me a story. He bought 200 shares of Berkshire in 1976. The shares doubled in a year or so and he got nervous. So he sold 100 shares and used the proceeds to start a restaurant. The other 100 shares (assuming he still holds them because he told me he was never going to sell them) are now worth $18,000,000. So its safe to say that this guy I was speaking to is the worlds greatest investor ever. He bought 100 shares. Never had to even think again. About anything. He couldve watched MTV and eaten nothing but Pringles for the next 35 years. And now hes got $18,000,000 in the bank. But he has big regrets. Because he sold those other 100 shares on only a double.Oh well. We have some work to do here. Because its not easy to find unusual things about Warren Buffett. But if you didnt notice the picture above, I wrote THE book on Warren Buffett. The one book thats not even mentioned in the exhaustive list of books mentioned on buffetts Wikipedia page.1) House I really did drive right up to his house in a cab. Heres his house:Its a 5 bedroom house he bought in 1956 for $31,500.Its one house among many on a normal suburban block. The guy next door to him might as well be worth $0 and his next door neighbor is worth $60,000,000,000.00To me, that shows a lot of discipline. Every time in my life I've ever made moneyI would make mistake of buying a home. Heres a story about Buffett.Hes playing golf with a bunch of people and they all bet a dollar on a particular hole. Buffett wont bet. Why not, Warren? they ask him, youre worth a gazillion.He said, I never break my discipline.By contrast heres the house of his bridge partner Bill Gates:(a 9 building compound worth $150 mm)2) His worst investment ever I asked this question on Twitter earlier. I said, he lost his self-esteem and 20% in that order. Everyone came back with very smart responses: Conoco Phillips, where he lost $1 bb (but not 20% of his net worth (not even 2% of his net worth) and certainly not his self-esteem). The Berkshire Hathaway business itself was a bust. But the stock zoomed and Buffett made the bulk of his net worth on Berkshire Hathaway.No, the answer is a Sinclair gas station he bought in 1951 with a friend of his. On the weekends hed even squeegee peoples windows. But the Texaco station right across the street destroyed him. He lost $2000, when his savings was about $9600 at the time.He put a lot of work and love into that little baby and it all went down the drain. But that experience probably gave him the desire to have a more passive management style. A style he later mastered at Berkshire.3) He was rejected from Harvard Business SchoolIf you think about it, Harvard must have a pretty bad reputation by now. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg hated it so much that they dropped out. And the one time they couldve landed the best businessman ever, they rejected him.Like most smart people, Buffett didn't even really want to go to college. He started out at Wharton but then switched back to his hometown college in Omaha because he didnt like it. Then, after being rejected by the best business school in the country, he went to Columbia.The reality is that people at the genius level (Buffett, Einstein, Gates, etc) have no use for college but some cases (Buffett) reluctantly go through the motions.4) He was a victim of reverse anti-SemitismWhen he originally wanted to work for his mentor Ben Graham, on Wall Street, Graham said, no. Buffett was shocked and asked why. Graham told him it was because he wasnt Jewish. Graham wanted to save a spot in the firm for a Jewish person. To be fair, Graham was worried that Jews couldnt be hired anywhere else on Gentile Wall Street so he wanted his firm to be Jewish-friendly.The key to success though is persistence. Buffett went back to Omaha but kept pitching ideas to Graham until Graham eventually hired him. Persistence is the only sure-fire method for obtaining success.5) Adam SmithIts useful to look at the history of the field you want to master. When I was trading for Victor Neiderhoffer I saw that he had collected just about every finance book from 1800 on. So I started reading books anywhere from 100 to 30 years old just to see what people were thinking and how finance and trading had evolved.One book, Supermoney was by the pseudonymous Adam Smith detailing random adventures he had as a reporter in finance in the late 60s, early 70s. On one adventure he decided to visit a retired investor (the book was written around 1972) who was trying to figure out what to do with the rest of his life now that he had $20 million after shutting down his hedge fund. They drove around and had a rambling conversation. At one point they passed a furniture store and the investor pointed out the window, Im going to own that one day.Obviously, that investor was Warren Buffett. But Smith didnt know then that he was dealing with WARREN BUFFETT because he wasnt in all-caps yet. And, in fact, many years later Buffett did buy that furniture store.I thought Supermoney was fascinating for its predictive abilities. How could Smith know that Buffett would be the best investor to profile? In the next profile after Buffett , Smith wrote about a guy who was sitting in a Swiss jail. If you screw up a bank in Switzerland you are going to jail, no get-out-of-jail free cards. What was this guy doing while in jail? Trying to write some fiction. Thats where the profile ends. Paul Erdman went on to become the bestselling finance thriller writer ever. I highly recommend his novels.In any case, its a great chance to see how someone described Buffett before he became BUFFETT. I mentioned this to Pamela van Giessen at Wiley and she ended up republishing the book as a Wiley Investment Classic. I give myself full credit on that one even if she disagrees with me.6) The SEC investigated Buffett in 1974-1976 for manipulating penny stocks. This was a serious charge. And Buffett takes his reputation seriously. And the reality is (I wont get into details but Janet Lowe covers it here), he WAS manipulating penny stocks and he sort of admits it. But he had a good reason. He was buying a company and he promised a shareholder of the company that the price wouldnt be lower than a certain number. So he made sure the price of the penny stock never fell below that number. Or something like that. If I got the details wrong, Warren, you can put a gun to my head and fire the bullet. Suffice to say, the SEC didnt know what to do with someone like Warren so they slapped him on the wrist (some historical versions say the face) . He admitted nothing but one of his companies paid a $115,000 fine.Im sure he was nervous his reputation was going to go down the tubes but he survived to live another day.7) Zen Its not so bad to pick up the habits of Warren Buffett for a week and try them out:No computer on his deskNo cell phoneHe plays bridge 12 hours a week (I guess he uses a computer at home for this). Bill Gates is often his bridge partner.Try it for one week: no computer, no cell phone, play a game for at least 12 hours for the week.(Buffett and Gates playing bridge)8 ) LoveUgh, I was going to do 10 of these but Im getting tired. Theres a fun story about how he actually took over Berkshire Hathaway. It was more ruthless than anything JR Ewing would do. And Im not going to mention the intertwining personal relationships he had. Thats well-documented everywhere. But I give him credit for being open, unconventional, and living the life that best suited him with the least amount of stress. As his daughter, Susan, says: Unconventional is not a bad thing. More people should have unconventional marriages.But, one thing struck me as interesting. The annual meeting is about eight hours long. I dont recommend it to anyone. I cant remember anything he said except one thing. Actually I remember something Charlie Munger (Buffetts number two) said. Something to the effect that long-term you better bury all your guns and valuables in the backyard and at that point Buffett shut him up.But one thing Buffett said always stuck with me. Someone asked him, How do you measure success? And all 20,000 of us leaned forward to hear what the magic number was. But he said this: I measure success by how many people love me. And the best way to be loved is to be loveable.And that, to me was the most unusual thing about Warren Buffett.Read more: The Ultimate Cheat Sheet For Investing All of Your Money "

S" I'm glad you asked, because someone recently asked me: Why is Failure Good?Failure is the worst thing possible. You feel sick. You feel like youre going to die. You feel like if you dont die you might kill yourself.There is absolutely nothing good about failure. And theres nothing you can pretend to learn from failure.Lately, weve been living in the Golden Age of Failure Porn. Everyone wants to share their story. Everyone wants to fail forward.You cant learn anything from failure because dont forget that every single moment in your past has added up to that one moment in your present - where you are lying on the floor moaning your painful and abysmal failure.Stop whining. And stop using the word failure. Blah!Here are better things to learn from. Failure has many cousins. Learn from one of the cousins:- CURIOSITY: When something happens and you dont understand why, then ask, Why?Keep asking questions. Clearly, something confusing happened. Ask and ask and ask.Guess what will happen: you will get answers. - EXPERIMENT: Sometimes people say Thomas Edison failed 999 times before he finally came up with the lightbulb on the 1000th try.This is a total lie. It is normal in a lab to experiment with many many materials before coming up with the right one.Oh! Youre experiment didnt work? Ok, change something and lets try a new experiment.- PERSISTENCE: I get asked: how do I market my book? Or my app? Answer: write another book. Write another app.The best way to get better, to get more known, to learn the subtleties of your art or your field or your sport, is to simply do it again.Persistence + Love = Abundance. - FORGIVENESS: I used to live in regret. One time I sold a business for $15 million. Within two years I had lost almost all of the money.And it wasnt money on paper. It was money in real life. If I tell you how I lost it you would hate me forever. Thats ok. But its not important for this.Failure is a word used to label a past event. Thats 100% up to you how you label a past event.When you label a past event failure it prevents you from moving beyond the past. You get stuck there. You keep time traveling to the moment of failure under the excuse that there is something to learn there.The thing you learn first is forgiveness. Forgive yourself. Then you move back to the present. Get healthy. Be around people you love. Start being creative again.- STUDY: When you get a question wrong on a test, a good student doesnt call it a failure.Its a pointer to one single question wrong on a test. Study a bit more next time and you wont get that question wrong anymore.Understand and study and remember the correct answer. Dont keep living in the past where you remember the wrong answer.Athletes always go over their losses. They study videos. Go over games. Get advice from coaches. The coach doesnt say, heres where you failed!He says, heres where you should turn right instead of turn left.Botvinnik, the World Chess Champion in the 1950s, noticed he often lost chess games to people who smoked.So he would play practice games against people who would smoke in his face.He didnt say I fail against smokers. He became the World Chess Champion because of smokers.Failure is not a detail you can learn from. Again, its a label that describes nothing except a feeling inside of you.Details are what you can study and learn from. - HARD PROBLEMS: The key to success is to solve hard problems. Searching the Internet is hard. Google does it better than anyone.Making an electric car is hard. Tesla does it better than anyone.Figuring out a market for post-it notes was hard. The inventor tried for over 20 years. Now its 3Ms most successful consumer product.Writing a book is hard. Maybe your last book was bad. Thats ok. That happens to everyones first book. Now read a lot of good books so you can solve the hard problem of what makes a good book. Then write.Failure is not a hard problem. Its a label. Failure is in the past. Hard problems can be solved right now.- DONT CARE:When I thought I had failed, what I really was worried about was: would other people think I was a failure?Yes. Yes they did.When I stopped caring about that, when I took the word out of my vocabulary, I suddenly stopped caring what people thought.Then what happened? Only good things.My dad failed. He had a company that went bankrupt. He went broke.Then he got depressed. He couldnt stop thinking about the failure.Then he got sick. He was always sick. Because his body broke down from obsessing on the failure.Then he got a stroke. Depression + stress + sick = stroke. Then he never recovered and for two years he never moved and could only blink.Then he died.Ive started a lot of businesses. Some worked. Some didnt. Over a period of many many years. MANY.I hope Ive solved a lot of hard problems. Maybe not the best I couldve but I tried. And then tried again.Ive slipped on the ice rink and got up. Ive cried and wished I were dead but then I started asking questions.Lots of questions. Lots of studying. Lots of learning. Ive never failed.I am still alive.Read More: 13 Other Ways to Deal with FailureThe 1% Rule for Creating All Habits"

S' After losing over one million a week, cash, for the entire summer of 2000, I was forced to sell my apartment. So one day in 2002, all the boxes were packed, the apartment was empty. We had two moving trucks waiting downstairs to move us an hour north of the city. It was like an exile. My self-esteem was gone, my apartment was gone, I hadnt slept a full night in almost three years, and other things I cant even talk about. My ex-wife, my two toddler girls, and Lynne, a close family friend who was helping us move, were taking one last look around. Oh. My. God, Lynne said. This is really it.Its been a decade and a lot has happened, good and bad (mostly good). Someone on quora yesterday asked the question, whats it feel like to be rich? I figured Id answer based on my pre-2000 experiences. Ill save 2000-2010 for another time.A lot of people started answering the quora question with I was able to buy this, or that, or this and that.  Money was never about that for me, then or now. Theres never been anything I wanted to buy (other than the next ipad!) I have minimal material possessions. If you know me youd see I dress like crap and the edges of all of my pants are frayed. I dont own a suit. I dont have a drivers license so fancy cars are out. I like comic books more than paintings. I dont like to fly or sail. And I dont drink wine or eat out a lot. So what did it mean for me back then: DNA. I finally felt good enough about myself to pass on my genes and have children. I never wanted to have children before that. Theres apparently some evolutionary reason that we feel a strong urge to pass on our genes. I had never felt that before but somehow having a significant amount of money gave me permission to want to have kids. Safety. For the briefest of moments, I felt safe  like nothing could harm me and I could live forever. In 1999 I visited the Chairman of a company I was a shareholder of. I was in LA and he picked me up at the hotel in his latest Porsche. We drove to his enormous house and he gave me a tour. When we sat down he told me, I dont even have to do this anymore. I have so much money now that nothing can touch me. I know it sounds unbelievable and a clich but a year later he came down with cancer. After battling with cancer for years he was given worse and worse news about the outlook until eventually he shot himself and his kids found the body. I heard about the news when his wife called everyone in his address book. This is not meant to be a lesson. Money has its benefits but immortality is not one of them. (Although, if you must  How To Live Forever).Another example. A friend of mine was running a prominent gaming site and wanted to maybe sell it or do something with (it was 1999, so why not?) I introduced him to a successful guy I knew on Wall Street. I couldnt even find the guys office. I had never been down as south as Wall Street. My friend and I sat there while Shlomo (not his real name, but you get the drift) said, look at me! Ten years ago I was a shlub. Now I have 100 million dollars. Only in America, right? About two years later Shlomo was in the center of a massive FBI sting involving a currency brokerage he had started that had been simply pocketing investors money since the 70s. He went to jail. Even my orthodox friends turn away and refuse to talk about him whenever I ask if they knew him. Scarcity. My feelings of safety and immortality quickly gave way to scarcity. After all, I thought, if I could make 10 million dollars then it must be too easy. In fact, I honestly thought, everyone else had probably already made 11 million dollars. So then I felt poor again. I now needed 100 million dollars to be happy. I drove in a car with a friend of mine and his wife. I said, everyone has 10 million dollars now. She quickly said, not everyone. Friends. I lost some friends. Then I made some new friends. By the time I was going down in the elevator from my apartment that one last time, 100% of those new friends were destined to never speak to me again (at least through January 12, 2011). My new friends said things like, Mark Cuban is a stud or Fuck him. Take away all his shares or Good luck. Have a nice life or of course its legal!(one of many paintings I bought) The value of money. I realized (too late then, but I learned) that I never knew the value of money. I had never even been aware of money before. My prior goals had been playing games, making fun websites, or writing novels. Then my only goal was money, money, money, and more money. I told my therapist at the time, in 2001, its like losing a loved one and she said, sweetie, sounds like youve never really lost a loved one before.Money is a great thing. Its the payoff on hard work, great luck (which is often earned luck) and you can do amazing things with it. Build new businesses, create jobs, buy your independence and freedom from corporate America. But first you have to climb many hurdles, of which earning the money is only the first. Very few things are better than earning a lot of money.Money finds a home only in places where its appreciated. I didnt appreciate the money. So it left me.When we were in the car, driving to our new home back in 2002 it was in the middle of a snowstorm. I wanted to cry I felt so bad about what was happening. But it was too much to think about. So for a brief moment I watched the snow and remembered what it was like to be a kid. Tasting the first snow of the year on the tip of my tongue.Read More: What do you do after you make a ZILLION dollars?'

S' At midnight my door opened and I saw the shadow of someone about 4 feet tall walk into my room and stand by my side of the bed. I cant sleep, she said and she was smart enough to also say, my mind is racing. Over the nine years of her life so far she has probably heard me say that many times. Racing racing racing. At noon there are many things to think about. At 3 in the morning, there\'s nothing to think about. So we race. Like when I was losing a home and I threw a chair and the police were called. The third time police had to be called on me in life (out of five).So I took her hand and we walked downstairs and she gave me a lecture on what was going on in each one of her classes and she concluded with a discussion of the various Greek gods (Athena is my favorite, she said. Who is yours. Hermes?) And then I saw her yawn and I said maybe now she can try to go back to sleep, which she did.Im scared for her. My mind races also. How many times has my mind woken me up at midnight to remind me of how little money was in my bank account, or how many bills I had to pay, or how much I hated my job, or even hated being an entrepreneur with customers, clients, people screwing me, people hating me. I dont want her mind to wake her like that when shes older. Its the worst pain. And I might not be there then for her to talk to.Will she kill herself? Will she wake up her husband or girlfriend or whatever and say, my mind is racing. Talk to me.One time some bad business things were happening to me. Something was shutting down, other things were going down. Some people were cheating me. Whatever. My mind was racing. I woke up Claudia. Breathe like this, she said. It was two in the morning but she wanted to help. She had me do a breathing exercise that involved quickly exhaling but I forget the rest of it. Then I fell asleep.One investor of mine told me I had a scarcity complex  that I always had a strong feeling that I had nothing even when I had many things to be happy about. This was about eight years ago. I agreed with him. He wanted to be my mentor.  I wanted him to sell his business  then let me invest the money. So I agreed to everything he said. I did that back then. But in this case maybe he was right. Unless Im at optimal health in every way I constantly feel like I have less than nothing. Its post-traumatic stress from losing everything several times and watching my father lose everything twenty years earlier.No toys will ever patch that bleeding.The country now has a scarcity complex. The banks took everything. The government took everything. There are no jobs. There is no money. Everyone is in despair. Everyone is scared about feeding their family. Scared and scarred. Greece, Japan, China, Libya, terrorism, Jamie Dimon, Obama, Rich Perry. These are the monsters in the closet at night.Im tired of monsters in my closet. Anger wont change anything. Complaining wont change anything.I want to be consistently in the 1%. Not of money. Money comes and goes, talking of Michelangelo.I want to be in the 1% of the happiest people on Earth.My only goal is to be in the 1% of happiness. Else, if Im in the 99%, then all of my other goals will also fall short of the 1%. You cant meet the love of your life, for instance, if youre in the botton 99%. At least, from my experience it will be harder. Its like taking out the garbage and expecting to meet the love of your life in the garbage can.My life is like a laboratory and happiness has been the experiment. Only when Ive been in the 1% of happiness have my other goals been satisfactorily achieved.So I know what I have to do when I slip into the 99%. This might not work for everyone. Maybe some people have to protest with signs to be in the top 1% of happiness. That doesnt work for me.But these ten things work for me:A) Lately, exercise has worked for me to stay in shape and sweat out toxins. Bad stuff builds up in the body. You have the usual disgusting methods to get out bad toxins that go into the digestion system. But what about bad stuff that builds up in every pore of your body. You have to sweat it out. Sometimes just 100 pushups a day will do it. For me, I like doing yoga.B) I dont have a lot of friends. But I do know enough people that I can do this: every day I make sure I dont talk to people who bring me down. And I try to meet new people who bring me up. I wont do business with anyone who brings me down. The last time I tried that, my body told me, Bad James! On the second day on the job I fell straight to the ground and sprained my ankle for no obvious reason. If you let it, the reactions in your body (any part of your body) will tell you if you are with good people or bad people. When I get an email from someone who is bad for me, I usually get a quick stomach ache. So I delete the mail and put the emailer in Spam. Itss the only solution if I want to be in the 1%. I dont engage at all with anyone who is going to bring me down. Why should I? [See. How to Deal With Crappy People"]C) I like to be creative. Whether its through this blog or writing down a list of ideas or even drawing. It makes my brain come to life in ways that its not used to. Its important here, to never expect results from your creativity. When I was working on the pilot of a TV show, for instance, it made me very anxious to know whether or not it was going to get accepted. I was too attached to the results of the creativity. Just like now I might be too attached to blog traffic.D) Avoid these nine obstacles to success: @The Nine Ways to Guarantee Success - Altucher ConfidentialAny one of these nine will make me unhappy.E) I try to avoid all leaks For instance, Im happily married. Cheating on my wife would make me unhappily married. BAM! That would put me in the 99%.F) I try to be as grateful as possible. When I remind someone what theyve done for me and how happy it made me it not only brings back memories of that happiness it also makes me happy that Im helping them be happy by being grateful for them.G) I try to surrender. I say to myself, I cant do everything. I cant take this pain. I cant have everything I want. Sometimes Im helpless in the face of my material goals. So YOU figure it out. I dont even know who Im talking to. Who YOU is. I might be talking to my teddy bear when I say that.But having a sense of surrender and humility will help me reduce my needs (I dont need a yacht for instance) and help me to feel humility. Theres a physical exercise thats good to practice surrender if you are not good at it. In America were not really good at surrender. We never give up. We want to win every war. The exercise is to reach down and touch your toes. It obscures your vision (because you are staring at your knees), its almost impossible (you have to be flexible, both physically and mentally), and it looks like your bowing, which is an unusual thing for Americans to do. So it teaches surrender if you are uncomfortable with it.(Claudia touching her toes)H) I try not to lie to anyone or harm anyone. Because then you have to keep track of which lie was told to who. Or you feel bad about who you harmed, which was usually as a result of either anger or greed. If I never harm anyone I never have to deal with anyones anger (unless its irrational anger). Anger makes me unhappy.I) Sometimes you cant avoid work that you dont want to do. We all have to feed our families. But, in general, if I were to move every day towards staying away from corporate America (fluorescent lights and bosses make me less happy) then Ill be more happy.J) I need a tenth thing so that I can call this post, Ten Ways to be in the Top 1% so hold on a second while I think of somethingcoffee? No, sometimes it spills on me. A lot of sex? Makes me VERY happy but sometimes makes me jealous or anxious. Ahh, sleeping 8-9 hours a day. Because then I know Im in the top 1% for at least 1/3 of the day. And I also know I wont be tired the other 2/3, which would put me in the bottom 99%.And if Im consistently in the top 1% of happiness, maybe theres a slight chance my two daughters , and maybe others I interact with, will be in the top 1% when theyre older. Happiness is both contagious and hereditary. And so onRead More: The 1% Rule for Creating All Habits'

S' Habits dont change in a day. But 1% a day makes every habit work. Every.The reason is: they work if you do a little each day. If you relax and give yourself permission to only improve a little each day, then a good habit works.Its permission to improve. Its also permission to fail. Because when you first start something, youre on day one.If you want to succeed at anything, you have to give yourself permission to fail twice as much as you thought you would.If you insist, I need to change RIGHT NOW, then it wont work. Youll only get worse.If you insist the habit changes tomorrow, then the habit will certainly fail.Coolio, the rapper, wrote lyrics every day for 17 years before having a hit.Commander Hadfield, the astronaut, improved his skills every day for 20 years before getting into space.Kurt Vonnegut wrote every day for 25 years before he had a major bestseller.Even Mozart, despite being a prodigy, wrote music for 10 years every day before becoming a true master.Improve a little each day. It compounds. When 1% compounds every day, it doubles every 72 days, not every 100 days. Compounding tiny excellence is what creates big excellence.You cant be a master in one day. You have to improve a little every day.Picasso created 2 works of art a day. Thats 50,000 in a lifetime. It adds up.But its too late for me!.No, its not. Compounding creates fast results.If I read 5 pages a day from non-fiction books, then in a year I will have read 1830 pages of knowledge. And each page I read will build upon the pages Ive read before.And its 1830 pages 99% of people wont read. Most people dont pick up a book after age 20.If I write 1000 words a day, then in one day thats nothing. In one year thats the equivalent of 6-8 novels.Also you can also decrease 1% a day. We can say, aww, its only one day. Dont pressure me!Such an easy choice. It seems trivial. 1% up or 1% down. But it sneaks up. And then were old and lonely.Every day matters.When I was losing all of my money, and hanging around with the wrong people. And taking the wrong drugs and dating the wrong people, Its because I was saying, its just 1 day. Or, I dont need to improve every day, it adds up to nothing.Because I couldnt see how it was adding up at first. And that became my trademarked technique for losing everything, For losing my mind. For being lonely.It was the one thing that worked: 1% decrease a day cost me everything. I had to get back to 1% up a day.The 1% Rule can be applied to everything. If I spend 1 less minute feeling regret and use that to feel gratitude, how much better for my stress levels will that be2 in one years time.Stress is 100% reverse correlated with longer healthier happier life. With more money. With more love. With more creativity.Every habit can be built using this technique.Thoughts are in the head. Thinking, this seems like a good habit is a start. Reading about it is a second start. ButActions are outside of the head or body. Take 1% action per day.More than that and youll give-up (diets dont work!). Less than that and it might take too long (diets dont work!).It doesnt happen in one day. There are no goals. Theres only practice. Practice never makes perfect. Practice makes happy. Practice makes habits.I started writing 23 years ago. Every day I read a little. Every day I wrote. I wanted to get better.I was very bad at the beginning.I just looked at some fiction I wrote 23 years ago. WOW! Very bad.Every day I wake up and think, how can I be a little better? Just a tiny bit. Because I know it will make me feel good today to practice. And I know it will add up.Read More: How to be THE LUCKIEST GUY ON THE PLANET in 4 Easy Step'

S' I once went to a Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. I met a guy who told me how in 1976 he bought 200 shares.After a year the stock had doubled so I decided to take some profits off the table. I sold 100 shares and started a restaurant and ran that for the next 30 years, he said. Made a decent living." "The other 100 shares I did nothing with at all. Now its worth over $12 million." I admit it. I was jealous. I wanted to be him. After that I got ahold of Warren Buffetts letters. Not his Berkshire letters, which were available to the public. But his hedge fund letters, which at the time were private. I studied each one. Then I wrote a book, Trade Like Warren Buffett" (dont buy it) because when he was running his hedge fund in the 50s and 60s he was a much more active trader than he is now. Much more nimble. Warren Buffett doesnt look at P/E ratios. Hes not a value investor in the classic sense. He bets on demographic trends. The most important investing quote hes ever said is, If a company will be here in 20 years then it is probably a good investment now. This is not always true. He said, probably. So what companies will probably be here in 20 years? I have no clue. Nor does he. But I will bet on the companies that are returning cash to shareholders. As Mark Cuban told me the other day, a company is only worth the money you get back from it." So lets look at the companies Warren Buffett (or his team) added to in 2014, and highlight the ones that are returning money to cash holders. The ones paying dividends. USB (US. Bancorp) - paying 2.2%. US Bancorp didnt raise its dividend in 2009 but it raised its dividend for the 37 straight years before that and has raised its dividend since. XOM (Exxon). With the US about to become the next Saudi Arabia, Im always looking for the leader to buy. XOM yields 2.7% and has raised its dividend for 32 years in a row. Its pretty likely this company will be here 20 years from now. GSK (Glaxo SmithKline). People are getting old. Old people need medicine. GSK pays a 4.7% dividend and has raised it at least 10 years in a row. CBI (Chicago Bridge & Iron). What an odd name for a company based in the Hague that builds power plants but the reality is: if we need more energy, which we do, we need someone to build the power plants. CBI has a yield of 0.40%. WMT (Wal-mart) Buffett added also to his position in Wal-mart, the biggest store in the world. Im on vacation in South Florida right now. I feel like theres a Wal-mart every mile. WMT yields 2.5% and has raised their dividend for at least the last ten years straight. PSX (Phillips 66) - again if you believe, as I do (and Warren Buffett does) that the US is going to be a bigger exporter of oil than Saudi Arabia than the marketing and refining of that oil is key. Buffett added to his PSX position, which has been raising dividends since 2002 and now yields over 2.3%. IRM (Iron Mountain). In the past ten years, the US has multiplied by ten the regulatory requirements of corporate America. Im not saying this is good or bad. I dont really care. But I do care about making money from it. IRM provides all storage management for companies: paper, digital, etc. And yeilds 3.7%. Theyve raised dividends for at least 10 years in a row and have also been buying back shares. (I asked a cab driver to take me by his house. Just a simple house on a corner of a suburban block). Ok, thats the basic idea. My rule of thumb is to always invest behind people who are smarter than me. Warren Buffett is smarter than me. One anecdote from the meeting. Someone asked Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett what was going to happen to the US dollar. Munger, who barely spoke the entire meeting, said, "you better start burying all your valuables in your back y-And thats when Buffett interrupted him with a stern, Charlie!" I dont know whats going to happen to the US dollar. Or any of these stocks. Or my relationship with my wife. Or my relationships with my kids. One time a doctor told me we all have cancer cells, we just dont see them all the time. Ok, all of this is good to know. But I do think Buffett knows more about all of this than I do.And if I filter his knowledge with the basic fact that its good for companies to pay me cash every day, and if I filter that with demographic trends, and if I throw in an added filter that these companies have been raising their dividends for years, and on top of that I say, am I diversified, then I know that I will build an ok portfolio. And if Warren Buffett is picking all the stocks for me for free (he is my unpaid intern after all), then Im pretty confident that this is a good start.

S' Me.Here is one quick story of many...I gave my 11 year old daughter important advice the other day: theres no painless way to kill yourself.What about with a gun? she said.I told her about a friend of mine who shot himself in the mouth. He put the gun in his mouth and pointed upwards towards the brain.He missed.He shot off half his face, he went blind in one eye, and he is now in a wheelchair.If you type in "I Want to Die" into google, my website is the first result.My first business I sold for $15 million. We built websites for entertainment companies. Bad Boy Records, Miramax, Time Warner, HBO, Sony, Disney, Loud Records, Interscope, on and on. Oh, and Con Edison.Mobb Deep would hang out in my office. Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails would stop by. RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan would want to play chess. We even made a website for a brothel in Nevada.Then I saw that kids in junior high school were learning HTML. So I sold the business.I bought an apartment for millions. I rebuilt it. Feng Shui! I bought art. I played a lot of poker. I began investing in companies. A million here. A few hundred thousand there.Then I started more companies. Then I bought more things. Then I became an addict. The worst kind of addict.From June 2000 until September, 2001 I probably lost $1 million a month.I couldnt stop. I wanted to get back up to the peak.I wanted to be loved. I wanted to have $100 million so people would love me.Writing this now I even feel like slitting my wrists and stomach. I have 2 kids.I felt like I was going to die. That zero equals death. I couldnt believe how stupid I had been.I lost all my friends. Nobody returned calls. I would go to the ATM machine  from $15 million to $143 left.There were no jobs, There was nothing.One weekend when I had $0 left in my bank account I called my parents to borrow money but they said no. College was enough they told me, even though I had ended up paying for every dime of college. That was the last time I spoke to my dad, who had a stroke six months later.I tried meditation to calm down but it didnt work. I never slept. I lost 30 lbs. Im 59. I went from 160 to 130. I couldnt talk to anyone. I couldnt move. I stopped having ideas. I cried every day.There was never a moment when I didnt feel sick. I had let my kids down. I would die and they would never remember me.We moved 80 miles north of NYC with the tiny bit of money we took out of our apartment after being forced to sell at a million dollar loss.I couldnt leave the house for three months. I was depressed. I gained back all my weight and then another 30 lbs.Finally I had to either die or feed my family. I was forced to choose myself. I started to exercise every day. I started to eat better. One item for breakfast. A healthy lunch. Tiny dinner. No snacks. I started to sleep 9 hours a day. I started to only be around people who loved and supported me. I broke off all ties with anyone who I felt bad to be around. I wrote down ideas every day of articles I could write and about businesses I could start. Bit by bit I started to get paid to write. If you dont exercise the idea muscle it atrophies. I decided I wanted to help people every day and be honest every day. I was grateful for my daughters. I was grateful for what I had. I didnt fight reality or regret. This was my reality and I had to make the best of it. Every day I came up with ideas for new businesses. I had a waiters pad. I would go to a cafe at 6 in the morning with about 4 books and read for an hour or two and then start writing down ideas for new businesses, articles, etc. I started a hedge fund. I started a fund of hedge funds. I started a newsletter. I did deals. I made introductions every day, expanding my brand new network from scratch. At least 5 introductions a day. I got involved in a mental health company I sold for $41 million. I started a website, Stockpickr! which got millions of unique users. I found advertising for it. I sold it to The Street. I had made millions again from scratch.Then I stopped using the fundamental techniques I described above. Every time Ive lost money its because I squandered my physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health.I was really bad. I did everything you should not do. I was like an addict. Picture the worst abuses. That was me. Again.And then I lost it all again. Everything. Agh!I had to start over. I couldnt even believe I had to start from scratch atgain.Every day without fail I focus on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. And its worked. I hope. I hope I dont squander again.People say its not about the end, its about the journey.This is total BS.Its not about the journey and it never was.Its about right now.Right now is the only place youll ever be. Choose yourself not to waste it.-----To read more stories about failure and success, you can check out my blog here-> Altucher Confidential - Ideas for a World Out of Balance'

S" Well, read my writing. Why would I make that up? I was living on 40 Wall St. I was watching the traders go in and out of the exchange super-depressed. It was 2009. People were literally killing themselves at least once a day on my block. I wanted to do something about it. Nothing in the book is made up at all. So why would I make up that section. That section is almost stranger than fiction, which the truth often is. Hold on one second. I'm going to try to find the section and cut and paste it here so you don't even have to get the book to try and read it...one minute.....finding....OK. HERE. HAVE FUN WITH IT: (from Choose Yourself, middle of the book). Have you ever wondered why the stock market didnt just keep going down? Why it bounced at all from March 2009 until the day I am writing this, when the market is hitting all-time highs? Very simple--and I state this with all humility--I personally saved the US stock market. I moved to Wall Street in early March of 2009. Specifically, the corner of Broad and Wall in the building that was once JP Morgans bank. You may recall from your history books that the building was the site of the first major terrorist attack on the United States. On September 1, 1920, Italian anarchists exploded a bomb, killing 38, and injuring 143 (thank you Wikipedia. Thank you World Wide Web. Now I have every number I ever need for the rest of my life. My building, a bomb, 38 deaths). About 89 years later, at the worse possible time, someone decided to convert the building into apartments. The building was a ghost town. Nobody wanted to live on Wall Street. It was the black hole of capitalism. My building had bowling alley. A basketball court. A pool. A gym. And you couldnt give those apartments away. So, of course, I moved in. Directly outside my window: the world famous New York Stock Exchange. A huge flag lit up at night, projecting its negative shadow straight through my apartment. You couldnt find a more depressed group of people than the ones going to work every day at the New York Stock Exchange. But I loved living there. I felt like I was part of history. That maybe this would be a new start for me. I looked out my window and there was the New York Stock Exchange. I looked to the right and there was Federal Hall where George Washington was sworn in. I loved it. Which was an odd feeling, because everything else was going to hell. The S&P 500 was heading towards a 20 year low, where it reached the magically hellacious number of 666. I was losing more money than I thought possible and going through a divorce. One time I looked at my bank account. I considered, once again, jumping out the window, or figuring out what drugs would anesthetize me long enough Id never have to think about my problems again. I lost my job. Nobody wanted to talk to me because I was bullish on the market and everyone thought I was crazy. Nobody called me. Nobody wanted me. Certainly nobody wanted to help me make money. They had their own concerns. I was trying to get other companies started but I just didnt have my health and priorities intact and as we will see later, those are critical for success. I was just as depressed as everyone else. And it wasnt just that the stock market was at a low. Thats too easy an excuse. The human race hasnt survived for 200,000 years just to be shattered by a little blip in capitalism. Wed all had a tough decade. We all suffered from post-societal traumatic stress syndrome. The first step was admitting it: Internet bust. 9/11. Corporate corruption at a scale never seen before. Housing bust. Financial crisis. Bailouts. Madoffs. On and on. It was rough. As a society we got afraid. Too afraid to move. So I did the only thing I could do. I woke up early one morning in early March and bought a bag of chocolates. Small Hershey chocolates, like you hand out on Halloween. At around 8am I stood outside the entrance of the New York Stock Exchange and started handing out chocolates to everyone walking inside. People would be staring at their feet like zombies as they walked in, but 100% of the time, they would stop, look up, take the chocolate, and they would smile. Chocolate releases phenylephylamine , the same hormone that is released when you fall in love. Suddenly, for a brief moment, everyone in the stock exchange was a little closer to falling in love. This made them less likely to be depressed, at least that day. This is not to say you should eat chocolate all the time. Youll get obese. Much better to just simply fall in love.But we were having a hard month/year/decade right then and everyone needed a break. Everyone needed a piece of chocolate at the beginning of the work-day. It was March 9. A Monday. The Friday before, the S&P closed the week at its lowest point in 13 years (and ever since). By the end of the week, the S&P was up nearly 75 points. By the end of the month, it was up more than 125 points. And its been going up ever since.I'm not trying to brag. I'm not trying to say how great it is that I saved the global economy. It's not bragging if it's true."

S' This is like magic. Thank you. Finally a question made for me. I don\'t even need a belt to fit this question around my waist. First, I have some credentials. I\'ve failed at 17 businesses. I\'ve succeeded at a few. But failed at most. I\'ve also run a $125 million venture capital firm and I\'m currently invested in about 30 companies, many of which I advise or on the board, etc. Oh, one thing before I answer the question: the companies that NEVER call me are always the ones that are doing the best. I made lots of mistakes as a first time entrepreneur. In every possible way. And I see a lot of those mistakes repeated in companies I\'m invested in. I keep telling myself to remember these. Maybe this answer will be a good way for me to remember. Note: these are MISTAKES. So they are like double negatives. A) START YOUR BUSINESS WHEN YOU ARE BROKEDon\'t start a company if you\'re broke. This is not the same as "having no money". If you are fine staying on the floor of a friend\'s house and living on nothing then you are not quite broke. You have food and shelter. But if you have kids and a wife and a mortgage, etc (the other extreme) don\'t go broke and start a business. When I started my first business, I stayed at my full time job for 18 MONTHS before I left to become CEO of my startup full-time. We had 12 employees by then and almost as many clients. In other words, I knew I could replace my salary and still pay my employees for at least six months even if everything went down hill. Which leads me to....B) IF YOU ONLY HAVE MONEY TO LAST YOU SIX MONTHS THEN YOU ARE ALREADY OUT OF BUSINESSI was on the board of a company once and when I read the monthly financials I realized the burn (the monthly loss in cash) was such that we would run out of money in six months. I called the other board members. They hadn\'t even looked at the financials. I called the CEO. He said, "but we have six months!" This is really really important: if you have six months, IT IS ALREADY SIX MONTHS FROM NOW. What that means is: no matter what you do: you will not be able to raise the money, do the legal, find the customers, do the work, get paid, or whatever you need to do - in six months time. You are the walking dead and you don\'t know it. Here\'s what we did. I called an emergency board meeting. We explained the situation to the CEO. He refused to believe it. I called him separately and gave him ten different examples. He finally got it. We fired a lot of people to reduce the burn. Somehow it didn\'t reduce enough. We hired a bank. We went to all the usual players. Everyone said no about buying us. They all were waiting for us to die. And then they would scrape us up for nothing. Finally, someone bought us for a good amount 2x what we put in a few months ago. I don\'t know why did it. I just thank god they did. The CEO, who didn\'t even realize he was going to go broke, made $6 million and moved to another country. We officially sold the company the day before the company was going to run out of money. Six months after that first phone call to the day. C) SMOKE CRACKWe have a cognitive bias to think that our own ideas are great ideas. It\'s hard to admit that they won\'t work. Profits are the purifier of a business. That\'s the best way you can tell you have a good idea. If people give you SO MUCH money that you have money left over. Revenues are the next bests thing after profits. And users are the next best thing after that. If you are having trouble with any of the above three and this situation lasts more than a few months then you are smoking crack. You have to come up with a better idea. This doesn\'t apply to biotech or scientific companies that need to raise a lot of money. But it applies to every other business. D) UNDER PROMISE AND OVER DELIVERYes, this is a MISTAKE first-time entrepreneurs make. Your competition is over-promising. Here\'s what you can go wrong if you under-promise and over-deliver. First off, anyone who over-promises is going to win the business. They might do a bad job but possession is 9/10 the law. They have the client and they can do things to fix the relationship. Second, you might under promise and UNDER deliver. Then you\'re just a bad vendor and they will eventually switch to someone else. What\'s the solution? One thing: Over promise....and over deliver. Now you\'re amazing. And the client is there forever. E) DON\'T COMMUNICATEHere\'s the magic rule: talk to a new customer every day for 100 days. It doesn\'t matter what you talk about. Just call them and say, "how\'s it going?" Some customers might look at this and say, "I don\'t want to hear from my vendor for 100 days in a rule." They are lying. They do. And they don\'t know it. This is often called, "following up". As soon as you meet a potential customer, have an entire system in place to follow up. As soon as you deliver a proposal, follow up, as soon as you deliver a product, follow up. Even when you are in the middle of completing a project, follow up. FOLLOW UPYou call and just say, "I always want to make sure I\'m doing my best for you. Is all ok?" And then listen. And then say good-bye so you don\'t waste their time. Do that and you have a client for life. Trust me trust me trust me. F) HIRING PEOPLEMost startups don\'t need to hire that many people. Like, don\'t hire a secretary. Or a head of HR. Or even a head of sales. If you\'re the CEO, then you are the head of sales, the project manager, the secretary, and the head of HR. Wait, in each case, until you absolutely overwhelmed before you start hiring people. Once you hire someone there is a world of S**& that you have to deal with. Personalities, fights, politics, disagreements, gossip, etc. And, the most basic - they might do a bad job. A worse job than you would do because you are the OWNER and they are not. By the way, being overwhelmed is a good thing. It means you have revenues, profits, or users. Then you are allowed to hire people. The best business I\'ve ever started is when there was only one other person besides me. We started our first product for $2000. We sold eight months later for $10,000,000. We outsourced almost the entire business (by the way, the one bad thing about this is that Google wouldn\'t buy us because of this).It\'s not as good as it sounds. I\'m an idiot and lost a good chunk of the money later. But at least I didn\'t hire anyone.  G) CLEAR ROLESA lot of partnerships fail because there are no clear roles defined. Like, the two partners are "co-CEOs" so nobody knows who to talk to. This is BS. There have to be clear rules. I have a lot of examples. I\'ll give one I\'m dealing with right now. These are the roles of the founders: one person is a scientist - he makes the product. one person is an accountant - he does the booksone person is a good business guy and has been involved in startups - he makes the deals and finds partnershipsone person is good at raising money - he raises money and I forget who is CEO. One of them. It doesn\'t matter. Each is the final world on what he is good at. You can even divide up equity equally according to categories like this (and so some people might fit into more than one category so they get more equity): - made product- raised money- made sales- manages people- had the ideaThat\'s a sample. Not every business is structured so neatly but many are. When I was in a business where we did not have clear rules over who made the final decision, it was a mess. We ended up selling that company but now NONE of the original partners speak to each other anymore. We got lucky we sold that one.  H) DON\'T TESTIf you have a product idea, and you love it, and all your friends tell you its great, don\'t forget to test. Let\'s say your product is "protein water" - clear water that has zero calories and 30 grams of protein. BAM! Seems like an amazing idea. Put a Facebook ad up, with the design of the water bottle and say, "30g PROTEIN WATER". Simply see if people click. If noboody clicks, then you have a bad idea. If a lot of people click, then it\'s a great idea. This is one example. But this is a very important side-rule that most people don\'t believe: GOOD ENTREPRENEURS ARE RISK-ADVERSEBefore you risk, test. Before you leave your job, have customers. Before you hire people, have money in the bank. Before you even create you product, test it. Smart people test. Smart people don\'t take risks. I) WORRYING ABOUT STUFF YOU DON\'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUTToo many people think they have to hire lawyers and accountants and make a logo before they even start their company. Don\'t do BS stuff. Start your company, make your product, see if people want it, repeat. That\'s it. One company I don\'t think I even incorporated until they day before I sold it. Don\'t have too many meetings. Don\'t debate forever your list of values. Or your marketing slogan. If you make something people want, then the sale is easy, and you have a company. Period. No matter what your slogan is. So many people ask: but should we be an "S" Corp in Delaware. I don\'t care. It has nothing to do with how much money you will make. Believe in your product. Believe in helping your customers. Believe you can do it cheaply and always over-deliver and (repeating) HELP. Be risk-averse. Hold onto your money. I can throw some stuff in here about don\'t get bad investors but that\'s really a different topic. If you avoid all the mistakes above, then you will have a good shot at having a good business. Trust me on this. I\'ve seen a thousand businesses. You will have a good one if you follow the above ideas (or I should say, avoid the above mistakes). Oh, one more. J) HAVE SEX WITH EMPLOYEESThis is a really bad idea. Employees are there to help you get customers, deliver to customers, follow up with customers, and handle the running of your business. Once you start having sex with them, all sorts of bad things happen. I\'m not even kidding here. You might fall in love with them. You might have to deal with legal stuff. Other employees might get upset. And once one employee gets upset, that "upset-ness" spreads like a disease. Whenever an employee gossips badly about you, you have to fire them or the disease spreads. This is what starts to happen once you start having sex with employees. I\'ve seen great startups totally blow it because of this. Don\'t do it. -----There\'s a lot of other things that can go wrong, but this is the top. For instance, did you know its important to have a great relationship with your landlord?How come? Because he has to approve if you sell your company. Because suddenly he has a new tenant. But this is a small thing. There are many small things. Running a business is hard. These are the top 10 out of 100 (or 1000) mistakes I have seen. Good luck. And, seriously, don\'t do what I would do.'

S' Most non-fiction books are bad. And sometimes that\'s a great thing. It\'s because the writer spent his life getting GOOD at what he was writing about. He didn\'t spend his life being good at writing. He didn\'t spend his life typing. He ran a country. Or built a robot. Or discovered DNA or walked between the twin towers. He or She DID something. Something that changed lives. Something that went from his or her head out into the real world. I like reading billion-person books. Books, that if read widely, would change a billion lives. I like reading books where I feel my brain have an IQ orgasm. Like, I literally feel my IQ go up while reading the book. Before I give my list, I want to mention there are three kinds of non-fiction books: - BUSINESS CARD BOOKS: These are books like "How to be a leader". They establish the author as an expert. The author then uses this book to get speaking gigs or coaching or consulting gigs. These books usually suck. Don\'t read one. But nothing wrong with writing one. - BOOKS THAT SHOULD BE CHAPTERS: A publisher will see an article somewhere like, "12 ways to become smarter" and say, "that should be a book". Then the write mistakenly says, "ok" and he has to undergo the agony of changing something that was a perfectly good 2000 word article into a 60,000 word book. Those books suck. Don\'t read one. And DEFINITELY don\'t write one. Unless you want to waste a year of your life. I wasted 2004-2009 doing that. - BRAINGASM BOOKSHere\'s my top 10 list of braingasm books. Books that will raise your IQ between the time you start and the time you end. By the way, there are more than 10 of these books. This is just my TOP 10. Although not really in that order. It\'s hard for a small mind like mine to order these. "Mastery" by Robert GreeneThis book is like a curated version of 1000 biographies all under the guise, "how to become a master at what you love". "Bold" by Peter Diamondis and Steven KotlerBasically if you want to know the future, read this. Supplement it with "Abundance" by the same two and "Tomorrowland" by Steven Kotler" and even "The Rational Optimist" by Matt Ridley. I feel "Abundance" is like a sequel to "The Rational Optimist". So I\'m giving you four books with one recommendation. "Outliers" by Malcolm GladwellGladwell is not the first person to come up with the 10,000 hour rule. Nor is he the first person to document what it takes to become the best in the world at something. But his stories are so great as he explains these deep concepts. How did the Beatles become the best? Why are professional hockey players born in January, February and March? And so on. "Where Good Ideas Come From" by Steven JohnsonAlso add to this: "How We Got to Now" by Steven Johnson. Basically: don\'t believe the myth of the lonely genius. Ideas come from a confluence of history, "the adjacent possible" specific geographic locations, etc. The connections Johnson makes are brilliant. For instance, The Gutenberg Press (which, in itself, was invented because of improvements in sewing looms), made everyone realize they had bad vision. So the science of lenses was created. So microscopes were eventually created. So germs were eventually discovered. So modern medical science was discovered. And so on. Johnson is a thinker and a linker and tells a good story. "Man\'s Search for Meaning" by Victor FranklI\'m at a loss for words here. Just read it. Don\'t read it for the holocaust. Or psychological theory. Read it because when you\'re about halfway through you will realize your life is no longer the same. "Born Standing Up" by Steve MartinAnd while you are at it, throw in "Bounce" by Mathew Syed, who was the UK Ping Pong champion when he was younger. I love any book where someone took their passion, documented it, and shared it with us. That\'s when you can see the subleties, the hard work, the luck, the talent, the skill, all come together to form a champion. Heck, throw in, "An Astronaut\'s Guide to Earth" by Commander Chris Hadfield."Zero to One" by Peter ThielThere\'s a lot of business books out there. 99% of them are BS. Read this one. So many concepts really changed my attitude about not only business but capitalism. Thiel, the founder of PayPal, and first investor in Facebook, is brilliant in how he simply shares his theories on building a billion dollar business. "Quiet" by Susan CainProbably half the world is introverts. Maybe more. It\'s not an easy life to live. You feel as if you can\'t move, you can\'t talk, you can\'t go into a room and spread a vision you might have. Quiet shows the reader how to unlock the secret powers that probably half the world needs to unlock. "Antifragile" by Nassim TalebAnd throw in "The Black Swan" and "Fooled by Randomness". "Fragile" means if you hit something might break. "Resilient" means if you hit something, it will stay the same. But Nassim discusses "Antifragility" - building a system, even one that works for you on a personal level, where you if you harm it in some way it becomes stronger. He discusses Antifragility throughout history, up to our current economic situation, and even in our personal situations. "Mindset" by Carol DweckAgain, I am fascinated by the field of mastery. Not self-improvement (eat well, sleep well, etc) but on how can you continue a path of improvement so that you can really enjoy the subtleties at a very deep level of whatever it is you love. Carol Dweck, through massive research and storytelling, shows the reader how to continue on the path of improvement and why so many people fall off that path. These are not books I\'m picking so I can look smart. These are books that I feel have made me smarter.If I die now and I\'ve only read these books I\'m fine with that.'

S' I made the decision that ended up being unfortunate for this man and his family. But you can tell me if you think I made the right decision or not. We were pitching the US Post Office on a big project. It could\'ve been a million dollar project or more. Which was big for my small company. Everyone worked late Friday. Everyone worked Saturday and Sunday. The project proposal got finished. Relief! I handed to X. "Send this to them as fast as possible." So he used Federal Express. To the US Post Office. They called us the next day (10am delivery) and said, "are you kidding?" They said, "You used FedEx to pitch the US Post Office?" We could\'ve come up with something smart to say, "Hey, that\'s why you have to improve your branding." But we didn\'t and that would not have worked anyway. You don\'t FedEx the US Post Office on a million dollar project. This guy wasn\'t an intern. He was an employee for five years and just had his first kid. I had to fire him. Not because he made a dumb error. Not because he was a bad guy. But everyone worked hard on that project. And it meant a lot of salaries would get paid if we got that project. The project meant something to a lot of people. He did a bad job. But bad jobs are excusable. But you can\'t set a precedent that we can just give up on millions of dollars and all is ok. There has to be consequences. I don\'t know if I did the right thing. I\'ll never know. He lost his job and was probably scared for his family. But other people lost their jobs much later because we didn\'t have a potential million dollar project to fall back on. Running a company is hard and it\'s painful and a CEO is scared all of the time (at least I was). And that\'s why I will never be CEO of a company again.'

S' This is one of those questions where I give "the rules" and then at the end of the post I can say "and the last rule is to break all of the rules". It\'s almost a rule of "rules" posts that you have to have that at the end. You know why? Because we are all individuals. We all get physically healthy in different ways, for instance. Take diets as an example. Every diet says "don\'t". Don\'t eat carbs. Or don\'t eat meat. Or don\'t eat calories after 6pm. Etc. But for every "don\'t" there is at least one large massively healthy society that ONLY eats that macronutrient and yet they are healthy and live to 100+, etc. The essence of creativity is to take rules and figure out the way to break each rule so that it benefits you. I am an expert on what it takes to not be successful. Before I can give you the rules I must establish my credentials, which date back to six years old but after 10,000 hours of being a failure I have had my peak moments around 2002 and 2010 and maybe some at 2004 and 2005. and perhaps 2008. And a few failures around 1991 and 1994. I have started about 20 businesses and failed at 17 of them. I have failed as a husband, as have many. I hope I don\'t fail as a parent but certainly some people would look at my track record and say, "yes, yes indeed, he failed as a parent." I\'m not the best boyfriend. One time I broke up with a girlfriend while I was on the elevator up to meet her her in her apartment. I just hit the down button and never spoke to her again. And then I was a good boyfriend because I sent a teddy bear to the other girl who was in the elevator with me. We ended up dating three months. Before I met the woman who is now my wife. Am I the only person who is not successful at so many things? Maybe. Yes, maybe. But I also have had a few successes. So I know both sides of the story, as they say. And so I will give my rules. What worked for me when I was a success. And what failed for me as well. HERE IS WHAT FAILURES DO:1) They believe in the word failure.We dont live long enough to fail. Like if a planet is around for 4 billion years and produces no life-forms, I would call that planet a failure. Everything else is an experiment. I have started 20 businesses. But in the worst case, at best it was an experiment that didnt go right. People say, only focus on the Now and yet they dont know what that means. Focus on your past also. And really take a look. When I went to graduate school and was thrown out, did I fail? Perhaps in some versions of the English language. But I view it that I experimented going to graduate school (or raising $30 million for my second business) and the experiment didnt work out. It didnt work out for a host of reasons. I didnt really want to be a professor (the IPO book was ending). I would rather be a writer than a computer scientist (I had no idea what my company even did. We were just trying to ride the IPO boo). And so on. Thomas Edison never said, I failed 10,000 times before I made a lightbulb. The guy was in a LABORATORY. He experimented. And now everyone gets into failure porn and says he failed. Thats BS! John Coltrane didnt fail when he couldnt stay in Miles Davis quartet. He was experimenting with Miles Davis style but ultimately, with 20 years of practice and study under his belt, he knew that only his unique style could survive and flourish in his own quartet. He experimented, learned from the experiment and moved on. 2) THEY UNDER PROMISE AND OVER DELIVER. Everybody is told a lie: to be a success you have to under promise and over deliver. This is the worst form of lack of integrity. The idea is that you are safe. Lets say you under promise and you under deliver. You think, incorrectly, hey, at least I have my integrity intact. No, you have nothing intact. You are just like everyone else. There are 3,000,000,000 employees o the planet and they are all under promising and most of them are under delivering. You are just like them. Try this: Over promise. And over deliver on what you over-promised. Believe me, if we can send a rocket to the moon powered by a computer 1/100,000 the power of your smart phone then you can over promise and over deliver on almost everything. Try it and you will see the results. its amazing. 3) PEOPLE WHO FAIL SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF ACCIDENTSThey left their important project on the subway. They are sick. Their dog got sick. They broke up with their girlfriend or boyfriend. Theres a way to minimize accidents and its called health. You cant succeed if you are sick in bed. You cant succeed if you spent all night the night before reading your wifes emails because you cant trust her. You cant succeed if you arent grateful for being given at least the chance to be something better than what you are now. When someone consistently has a lot of excuses for why something has gotten done, I know they are not ready for the next step. The next step is an invitation to glory. They are not invited.yet. When I was young, I was the man with the excuses. I had them every day. I was a master of them. But I fooled nobody but myself. And went from job to job, business to business, blaming others, blaming external circumstances, etc. And you know what: I was right! If Im reading my wifes email and shes cheating on me, I deserve to fail. So heres what you do: You cant be perfect. But every day: Move, Eat, SleepWelllImprove your relationships (Call a friend, surprise a spouse, be kind to your kids)Be creative (only you know how to do this but at least write 10 random ideas a day)Be grateful for where you are. (and this is the Now that people brag about)4) DONT TAKE IT THE NEXT LEVELOh man, Im only on rule 3. You know, you ask these questions about how to succeed and fail in life and its not like two paragraphs is going to be the answer. Even long answers are just short cuts. Im working on a big project right now. Theres a lot of small details. If you are helping someone else on a big project. Your mentor, your boss, your teacher, your whatever - the one who has given you a chance - take some of those details and take it to the next level. The other day I was invited to a special screening of the movie Pawn Sacrifice starring Tobey Maguire as insane world chess champion Bobby Fischer. I was going to go. I had an extra ticket. I asked a lot of people to go with me. Finally, someone said yes. But then I realized I was too late. So I was an example of being a failure. I missed a detail. I failed rule #2. Thats ok. That happens to me. Whatever. Bobby Fischer always took it to the next level. Nobody ever thought he was the greatest talent in chess history. He probably had average talent. But he always said, "how can I take chess to the next level". When he was a kid he learned Russian so he could read the Russian chess magazines. After that, he never lost a US Championship. He was 13 years old. He was so much better than the Americans he even stopped playing in the US championship. And he took it to the next level right up until the world championship. For the first time in his life he played a different first move.His opponent, the older world champion had ONLY prepared for the one move Fischer ever did. So Fischer came up an entire new opening with a new first move. Gandhi took it to the next level. Every revolution before him was done with violence. He experimented. He had a vision. He felt that 300 milllion Indians didnt need to do violence. He was right, despite everyone disagreeing with him. Take the advice of everyone around you, and then take it to the next level. Practice taking it to the next level (because at first you wont be good). But do it over and over again and you will be THAT PERSON that knows how to take things above and beyond. 5) FAILURES TAKE ALL THE CREDITFailures are insecure. When they do their little stupid thing at work they want the credit. Give others credit all the time. Then you are the source of credit. Just like a bank. When people want more credit, who do they go to? They go to you! Just like they would go to the bank when they need more money. You look at the history of every company. The founders who never followed through and ended up not being successful (whatever happened to) are the ones who wanted credit too early on. They fought for it. They died for it. They cried for it. They went broke for it. Give credit. Be the bank. Be the source. 6) LACK OF INTEGRITYI dont mean be honest. Thats obvious. How do you take honesty and integrity to the next level? You become vulnerable. You admit mistakes before you have to. You offer people their money back when you\'ve lost it and didnt have to. I was talking to Ev Williams who started Twitter. When his older company, Odeo, wasn\'t working out - he and his board decided to give everyone their money back before moving on. That\'s integrity. Nobody has ever given me my money back. You give advice and help people when you sincerely want them to do better. Do this every day. It adds up. No, it doesn\'t add up. It multiplies. It compounds. Theres negative integrity and positive integrity. Negative integrity is saying to your boss: I failed because I missed the train. Positive integrity is, I like your idea for A, B, C reasons but how about you give a chance to X, Y, and Z and I bet we can make your idea a huge success to your boss. And then you give your boss total credit. Remember, these rules dont live in isolation. Its all one big rule. Its all about you being a vessel for a vision. Visions live for centuries more than people do.7) NO MONEY MANAGEMENTTheres three skills in money: Making it. Keeping it. Growing it. Making it is what we deal with for a long time. We need to pay the bills. We need to reduce money anxiety in life. But many people who are failures think that once they make it, the job is over. I thought my job was over when I had millions in the bank. So I stopped being healthy. So I stopped being nice to the people around me. So I spent money on a penthouse apartment and bouhgt art and got a house in Atlantic City and started gambling after taking helicopters back and forth. So I put money in every investment possible just to impress people. And then I had $143 left and I was dead broke and blame myself for the deaths of at least two people. When you make money, keep it. Dont even invest it. Put it in the bank. Dont be greedy for more. You only need to get rich once. Unless you want to buy a basketball team you dont need to get rich twice. And only when you are confident you can Keep it, you can THINK about growing it. But that takes a year or two first of keeping it. Please trust me on this one. Almost every failure I know (and I know a lot) didnt fail because they couldnt make money. They are broke now because they couldn\'t keep it. 8) NO FOLLOW THROUGHI have a very good friend who is a brilliant brilliant scientist. Maybe the most brilliant man I know. I would tell him this to his face: you have no follow through. He has an idea. Everyone says its amazing! AMAZING! You are so SMART! He gets about 30% of it done. And then he is on to the next Brilliant idea. BRILLIANT! His kids live on food stamps. And every single one of his ideas is not just a million dollar idea. But a TRILLION dollar idea. Im not exaggerating. But he cant follow through. The next idea is always bigger. Thomas Edison didnt say, I did it! when he made the light bulb. He called up the mayor of New York and worked out a deal to light up downtown New York City. The first city in history to be lit up at night by electricity. He got paid for that. He made a company. He followed through. He got rich. If you have trouble following through, delegate. But dont forget the other rules above: Over deliver. Integrity. Health. etc. 9) THEY DONT HAVE NOTEBOOKS. I carry at all times a waiters pad. I have over 100 waiters pads. In my pocket right now is one. In the table next to where I sleep is one. Saul Bellow once said, you never have to rewrite what you write in the middle of the night. How many times do you think of a great idea and you think, this is so GREAT I will never forget it and then you forget it. It happened to me this morning. Claudia and I were talking last night and she said, You have to write this down! and I said, there is NO WAY Im going to forget this. Well, I forgot it. I pray to the gods of memory I will remember it but I forgot it. 10) THEY DONT LISTENI say, on average, 10,000 words a day. I already know the things Im going to say. Meaning: they are already in my head. And Im just vomiting them out. When you listen, you learn. When you learn, you get better. When you get better you start to have a vision, you start to over deliver, you get more creative, and all the other good things above. Im going on a word diet. 2500 words a day. MAX. I might not succeed (its an experiment) but Im hoping I learn more today. And tomorrow. Listening is a form of giving credit. It means you value the words of other. Listening is a form of integrity. Because everyone offers something, you acknowledge that. Listening is a form of improving relationships with others. Listening is a way to outsource good ideas since if you let many others talk, some of them will give you good ideas you might not have thought of. Buddha didnt start a major religion by talking. It started because he sat under a tree and listened. Jesus spent 40 days in a desert. Listening. Moses listened to his wife (err.I mean a burning bush). Everything that has moved history happened because of listening instead of talking. Talking inspires. But listening creates the inspiration. -I can say break all of the above rules is the final rule. But Im not going to say that. You know why? Because this is not bullshit. This is not about how to fail or to succeed. This is exactly how I failed and succeeded. You can do whatever you want. I will never know your truth. This is my truth.'

S' I found my passion the moment I had a bottle full of pills in my mouth and I had the choice whether to swallow them or not. I had carefully researched what would do the trick. But I was worried if I swallowed the pills then the insurance companies wouldn\'t pay my kids $4 million in life insurance. They have a funny thing about being judgmental on suicide. Suicide is a horrible thing for kids. I know this because my wife\'s mother killed herself. Sometimes I hear Claudia crying in her sleep. It\'s either because she\'s married to me or it\'s because of her mother. Sometimes when I wake her I think she\'s about to confess that it\'s both. I didn\'t mean for that first sentence to sound dramatic. But before you can find passion, you have to live. You have to say, I WANT to live. Life is very hard. We\'re born and a moment later, the connection to all of our happiness that we\'ve ever experienced in the womb is cut by scissors. And then we are slapped hard by the doctor. Wake up! We\'re hit and slapped and burned by cigarettes all over our bodies over and over again until the day we die. So there\'s got to be a reason we put up with all this punishment. The first time I kissed a woman, I couldn\'t believe it. My lips touched the top of her lips, then the bottom of her pout. Then I found her, then I found me, and under a torn and desperate moon, I found a single moment of pleasure. It was wonderful. But I wondered, is this where the passion is? Because there are many of these moments, both good and bad, where inspiration might strike us. But at some point, they all meld together. And 10 years out I look back and I say, "that seems like yesterday". The days are bolted together by a stapler called "routine". What happened to those moments: my mom screaming my name though the neighborhood, my friends ignoring the parents, we were all on two or three piles of rocks on construction sites we were strictly forbidden from playing near. We were throwing rocks at each other. Because one side was Saturn and the other side was Jupiter and they were at war. Occasionally one of us would time travel and teleport to the other side. And the rock throwing would go in a different direction.There\'s no north and south in space. And we were in space, with laughter and fun and energy teleporting us back and forth, rocks were our weapons of mass destruction, laughter was our reasons for being, for ignoring the screaming intensity by which one day tediously turns into the next. "I hit him!" Einstein found his passion because he wondered what a man traveling the speed of light on a spaceship if he looked out the window and saw a man standing still. DaVinci found his passion drawing machines with wings that flapped like birds - the first illustrations of what 500 years later became planes. Just doodles. Thousands of them. Charles Darwin found his passion playing with rocks halfway around the world. He played with them, he kicked them around, he drew pictures of the tree of life around those rocks, for EIGHT YEARS, before returning to the land of adults where he accomplished his life\'s work while all of the adults jeered in his path. Mozart found his passion when he finally escaped the adulthood of a steady job in Salzburg, for the virility of Vienna where commanding operas and orchestras and singers and actors he grated Don Giovanni, the opera that changed every piece of music that ever came after that. Marie Curie found her passion, like so many of us, by again playing with rocks. Why did some rocks seem to be like the sun, their own source of light when all else around them was pitch black dark. Mick Jagger had no musical talent at all but would collect blues records from America and he and his childhood friend Keith Richards would lie around listening to them. When his parents sent him off to study at the London School of Economics, he was still listening to those records and doodling the notes rather than paying attention to supply versus demand. Mary Shelley wondered what it would be like if a machine had intelligence. She called her machine Frankenstein and made up stories about how people would treat such a hybrid human/machine. Ada Lovelace wondered what it would be like to tell a machine what to do. Could such a machine ever exist? Steve Jobs loved calligraphy and using electronics to scam the phone system. Nobody discovered their passion as an adult. The child that still lives and breathes and is hidden inside all of us knows the secret of our passion. Will this child tell us. Can we tease it to give us a clue? Will the child lead us on the right path or maybe play with us and show us the wrong directions first. It doesn\'t matter. It\'s by following the child inside of us that we get closer to the treasure buried at the bottom of an infinitely deep ocean. The ocean that is built from our responsibilities, our mortgages, our bosses, our schools, our governments, everything that puts a roadblock in between us and competence, us and our friends, us and our freedom. I try to be a child. And when adulthood gets in the way, I cry. I get scared. I want the childhood back. It\'s not easy. Because the world wants you to "act your age". So it becomes practice. It becomes exercise. But here are ten ways I still try to be a child every day. And every day I find my passion. And every day I know I have to repeat these tricks to find that child inside of me: - PLAYEvery day I have to do something for no other reason at all than that it\'s fun. If I don\'t do it, the no fun. What can you do that\'s fun? Play a game with someone else. Learn a magic trick. Sing. When people want me to meet at their office I suggest the local ping pong establishment instead. It\'s through Play that we get to know each other. That the children we left behind get to meet and together destroy the universe. - FREENobody paid Einstein to daydream about two people staring at each other, with one going through space as fast as he could. In fact, he was a clerk in a patent office and could\'ve stayed that way forever. Nobody paid Ada Lovelace to imagine a world of computers 12o years before one existed. She was supposed to just be a stay-at-home Countess and enjoy her luxuries. Every day I know I have to pay the bills to live. But I also have to do something totally free in order not to die. The world of money is a tiny subset of the world of imagination. - WHY?Why did the micro-cultures on one island look ever so slightly different than the micro-cultures that lived on the next? Darwin wondered. Why did uranium give off light? Marie Curie wondered. She wondered about it until it killed her. Why did Opera make Mozart tingle despite the acclaim he was receiving from the blander concertos popular at the time. Why do children ask why and when you answer they ask why again, and then again. When you take a subway in NYC it says "mind the gap". It\'s in the gaps of adults talking that you have to catch yourself and ask "Why?" "We just got divorced and then I moved to NYC," says one man to the other. "Why?" is what I always wonder. Why did you get divorced. Why did you pick NYC? It\'s none of my business. But a kid doesn\'t care. A kid asks Why?The Whys add up. The Whys add up on the search for passion. - FRIENDSHIPSA friend of mine is working on a TV show. I\'m going to meet him later today to see how it\'s going. To be honest, I want to write an episode for his TV show. Just for the fun of it. I have ideas for stories. It was my list of ten ideas each day this week. It was fun. But most of all, I want to hear all the things he\'s learning by doing his TV show. And then I want to ask him about my own creative challenges. Friendships challenge each other. First we throw rocks at each other. But those rocks ignite the imagination of Jupiter and Saturn and time travel. Look at all of the arts and sciences: Steve Jobs started as friends with Steve Wozniak long before they made a dime. Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. Jackson Pollack and Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein and later Andy Warhol. The friendships that pushed each other to the next level. That pushed each other to compete and to play and to battle and to create. To create!- INTERESTSPierre and Marie Curie simply wanted to find out why a rock would glow. And then they fell in love and became adults. Benjamin Franklin flew a kite to discover electricity. Galileo was interested in finding out what would happen if a boulder and a feather flew off a tall building at the same time and then discovered the most useful scientific theories of all time. - HOPES AND DREAMSWhen I was a little kid I had a notebook. It will filled with "David likes Lorie because I saw him look at her." and "Joanne likes Bobby because she laughed at his joke." I wrote every day. I wrote a play about a moon that was a live. I wrote a story about Presidents. I wanted to write. I had dreams. But dreams and mortgages have a hard time staying in the same head. It\'s ok to be worried about the mortgage. But don\'t forget to have a little bit of hope. And to see what happens if you act on that daydream, even if just a second. - DRAWINGS AND DRUMSI asked for a drumset as a kid. But I never used it. But I did draw. I doodled all the time. I drew every day. Adults say, "I can\'t draw." Of course you can! Here\'s a crayon. Go! I bought a box of crayons (16 colors) the other day. I just doodled. I colored things in. Some of the colors went outside the lines. Just practice staying kid-like. Draw a face. I drew my wife. It looked nothing like her. So I turned her into a monster. It still looked nothing like her. So I ripped up the drawing and started again. Like a kid. - MOVEMENTWhen I was a kid I\'d get home and jump on the bike (no helmet) and drove everywhere I could. I\'d cross the highway! Hopefully my parents never saw me. I ran up and down the street. We played football on the cement, throwing each other down. Movement gets every neuron creating. Gets the body healthy. Gets the emotions roaring as you touch and tackle and daydream and breathe in the air with the sun burnt from the day about to die into a sunset. - CONFUSIONWhen I first moved to New York and I had my very first vacation, I had no money to go anywhere. I was stuck in the city. So I would walk around. I wandered into areas I had never been before. I was confused where I was. I was confused why other people were out at 10 in the morning. Why weren\'t they at their jobs? I wandered from confusion to confusion. Eventually, I started a project, "3am" trying to figure out why people were out at 3 in the morning on a Wednesday night. I was confused and wanted to know. When I do a podcast and someone gives the stock answer they give in every other answer, I get confused. "But didn\'t you cry when that company failed?" I want to know. What did you do? - SOCIAL INCOMPETENCEI try to learn how to small talk. But I\'m not good at it. This is not a bad or good thing. I want to get better. But sometimes at a party with everyone laughing and having gun I feel alone and isolated. I try to figure my way out of that feeling of isolation. How can I have fun also? ---All of these things brings me back to those moments, both good and bad, when I was a kid. I practice being a kid. A kid laughs 300 times. An adult, on average...five. Sometimes I can go a week without laughing. Responsibilties, fear, loneliness, anxiety, regret, can weigh me down. I didn\'t have those as a kid. I try to laugh. I try to find things that make me align. As an adult you have to practice being a kid, letting that child peek out again. He or she wants to come out and play and see the world again. What\'s changed? The child wants to know!But guess what? The adults know. I have experience now. I\'ve had the pills in the mouth. I\'ve been divorced and lost two houses and lost a family. I\'ve lost my money and been scared and lost a business and had people hate me and try to ruin me. I\'ve had people I\'ve loved betray me and reject me. I\'ve had successes that came from hard work and from 100 hour work weeks I thought I would never survive but I learned persistence and I learned how to make it work. And I learned how to succeed and I learned how to survive failure. Some of the time. Experience mixed with childhood is a roller coaster. Is a playground. You swing as high as possible and experience knows you will come down safe. There\'s no one answer how to find your passion. But every day, give the child inside of you some exercise using the 10 ideas above. Mix that child with the experience you\'ve learned over the years of fire and ice. You\'ll find your passion. Your passion will find you. And it\'s there, in that kiss of passion and you, in that kiss of your inner child and your outer adult, that you will find it. In the middle its there, torn asunder but ready to be put together and to come out and play.'

S' When I started a business, by definition, I knew nothing about business. I had just started! I was the worst. Here\'s what I knew. This was the 90s. I knew how to make a website. Nobody else knew. So American Express came to me and said, "Can you build a website?" That started my business. HBO came to me and said, "Can you build a website?" Miramax came to me and said, "Can you build a website?" I\'m going to admit to you what I did not know: I did not know the business world values products (scalable) more than services (unscalable). The reason I did not know this is because services are profitable (You can always fire people when business is slow) Here\'s also what I did not know: how to hire people and fire people. Or how to manage people. I didn\'t know anything. Business is like "micro-economics". Supply and demand, etc. Macro-economics is like: what happens if there\'s a draught and we grow less corn. What happens? So here\'s what I don\'t know now: I don\'t know how to really read a "P&L" sheet. Just tell me your revenues and profits and let me ask some questions and I can figure out what\'s working and what\'s not. And here\'s also what I don\'t know now: what happens if there is a draught and there\'s no corn. Because it seems like that has nothing to do with real prices. The price of oil has nothing to do with the supply and demand for oil right now, for instance. So anyone who writes a book on "Macro-economics" is lying to you. Because it\'s a made up science. And Micro-economics they are lying to you also. Because what you need to know there is how to sell, how to come up with an idea, how to manage, how to build product, and how to be a leader. You can\'t learn that from a teacher. You can learn a tiny bit from books. What do you do if economics is BS and you are answering a question about "What are the 10 best Economics books?" I don\'t want to lie to you. I\'m going to give you the 10 best books that inspired me to make more money. That\'s, pure and simple, what I hear when I hear the world "economics". These books won\'t make you more money. But they will inspire you and point you in the right directions for making money. I\'m not going to give you books I read in college. Those are all BS books. For me, if I am honest, reading these books has caused me to have more money in my bank account. A) Zero to One by Peter Thiel. Changed my mind about the nature of competition, monopolies and the role of employees. Also check out my podcast with him. B) Abundance by Peter Diamandis.  If someone ever "dooms and glooms" you, this is the book to read. The rest of the people are trying to scare you. C) The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene. Not because he teaches you how to be "powerful". That word means nothing. It\'s just...he\'s smart. Read him. D) Mindset by Carol Dweck. Are you fixed, or growth. When and why? E) The End of Jobs by Taylor Pearson. A book about our current world situation is just a photograph. One moment from now it will change. One moment ago it was different. This book by Taylor is about this moment. And it\'s important to read. (Or check out my podcast with him) F) Tomorrowland by Steven KotlerMight as well know what trends are happening and the state of where they are now. G) Are You Fully Charged? This book will make you a better person, leader, businessman. At least...it did for me. Plus I have a man-crush on Tom Rath. H) Sapiens by Blah Blah Blah. I hate always looking up his name. My wife and I always just call him, "Israeli guy". This book is the most important economics book ever. If there were such a thing as economics. Who cares. Read it. The 80,000 year overview of where we\'ve been and where we are going. At the very least you will be smart at cocktail parties after you read this book. I like reading books where I feel like my IQ is going up while I am reading it. I) The Rational Optimist. Again an anti-doom and gloom book by the astonishing Matt Ridley. This is another one of those books where your IQ is higher after you read it. J) History of the World is Six Glasses. My kid had to read this for school. And then I read it. It\'s great to take a well-trodden topic (history) and re-formulate it in terms of what we drank and how the answer to that question is totally what changed history. Practicing having a mindset like that, where you turn the common into the fantastic, is what makes one a good economist. Again, I can list a lot more. I don\'t want to limit myself to ten. I have book club where I list many more but you don\'t need it. [Oh, I\'m editing this post. One more CRITICAL ONE: "Antifragile" by Nassim Taleb. But with a caveat. As you read it, try to determine how it personally can change your life as opposed to reading it as an economics book.]Do this: - start with these ten. - don\'t listen to anyone who uses the word "economics" (after this post of course)- make a lot of money using what you learned in these ten books. Love me.'

S' There are zero good books about writing. They are scams. Many people will say, "Stephen King\'s \'On Writing\'". Total scam. For one thing, the book is about Stephen King having a truck hit him while he was reading while he was walking in the middle of the road. If you want to be a good writer, don\'t do that. Don\'t read and walk in the middle of the road. Some people will say, "Ray Bradbuy\'s \'Zen and the Art of Writing\'". This is a good book but not a book about writing. It\'s a collection of essays about all the things Ray Bradbury has been interested in in his life. It just so happens he later writes about dinosaurs, or people with tattoos, or whatever. He gets so passionate about a man with tattoos that he writes abut them. Occasionally I hear a ridiculous answer like "Strunk & White\'s" book. Who? Who are these people. And yes, grammar is important. But that\'s what editors are for. I love Anne Lamott\'s book "Bird by Bird". But some people hate it. Some people don\'t like how she describes writing. So it\'s not in the top three books about how to write. I can\'t read a book "How to be a great golfer" and get better at golf. Here\'s what I have to do: - I have to golf a lot- I have to take lessons from a pro- I have to take video of myself golfing and have the pro go over with me every stroke I did WRONG. - I have to practice those strokes over and over again. As Bruce Lee says, I don\'t fear the man who practices 10,000 kicks, I fear the man who practices 1 kick 10,000 times. - I have play competitive golf. When you play something competitively you learn the emotional psychology of how to deal with the adrenaline and tension that comes with playing with the grownups. And then with all of the above, I have to repeat. A lot of writers will say you have to write a lot. This is not really as true as people think. It depends what you want to write. If you want to write a piece of literary fiction, you probably need to write a lot. If you want to write 600 pages on butterflies, you have to sit down and write a lot. Only because sitting down that long to do anything is very difficult. If someone wrote a book: "How to sit down for 10,000 hours and not get bored while staring at a luminescent screen" then that would probably be a good book about how to write better. Some people say you have to read a lot. This is partly true. But if I had to research everything, then why not just hand people a reading list of what you researched. Then you don\'t have to write a book. You can write a paragraph about why you used each book and knit that altogether into a theory. You do have to experience a lot. But don\'t be fooled. There\'s two ways to have drama. One is: you can have it in your life. Which is often painful. I don\'t want to go to a war just so I can write about it. I don\'t want to be an orphan just so I can write about it. You either have drama in your life or in your writing. It\'s very hard to have drama in both. You should experience something: passion for what you want to write about. If you have a lot of experience being President of the United States then you can probably transcribe that and make a book. Or if you think that eventually we will colonize Mars and then have a war with the robots we left behind on Earth then you can probably write a novel. But stick to what happens. ("Then the explosions came...") Don\'t focus on being flowery with you writing. I do think reading helps you use virtual mentors to teach you how to do some writing. But it depends on what kind of writing you want to do. If you want to write mystery novels, read a lot of popular mystery novels. That will make you a better mystery novel writer. BUT ONLY if you follow one trick: once you have figured out "the rules" on the popular mystery novels, be strong enough to change them a bit. Now you will turn into a good writer (with 10,000 hours practice and 10 books written). I\'ve written 17 books. 10 of them were awful. I will tell you right now I wish I can buy them back from the publishers and burn them. I will be a book burner of my own books. But some are ok. My reading list should be different from everyone else. But these are the books I\'ve read that have made me a better writer. I bet some of them will work for you. I also encourage you to add to this list in the comments. I\'m always on the hunt for more: 1) A collection of short stories: Jesus\' Son, by Denis Johnson (his literary style combined with his poetry background creates unimaginable beauty on the page) 2) Mastery, by Robert Greene (non-fiction. He\'s just so smart)3) Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut (the way he anchors the story into the most intense moment in his life and then gives himself permission to go off on any tangent he wants after that). 4) Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway (it\'s almost a cliche to say this book. But this is the best example of: if you remove or add one word from this book it will make the book worse). 5) The Road by Cormac Macarthy (same as above, only in a dystopian science fiction world). 6) Interview with a Vampire. (I haven\'t read this book in over 20 years. But I still remember how she had small chapters and ended every small chapter with a cliffhanger. So I always had to turn the page. If all you do is remember: how can I make the reader read the next sentence, you win). I don\'t even like books about vampires but if I am being honest about what influences me, this one is it. 7) Factotum by Bukowski. Again, the beauty of the small chapter on an otherwise totally boring topic. Also, he was a poet first and I think people who read this book often miss the self-awareness that comes cloaked inside his ego. 8) Ant Farm. Simon Rich is funny. Funny is good. 9) A Million Little Pieces. Call him a fraud. Call him whatever. But I like the way James Frey breaks the rules in this book. It\'s a book about breaking the rules in writing. 10) Steps by Jerzy Kosinski. Short chapters. Each one gets intense quickly. It\'s a novel and none of the chapters are really connected. It\'s basically a book by an insane man who later killed himself. And that\'s writing. Also good by him: Cockpit. 11) Man\'s Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl (but only part 1 - not the theory part). His entire "meaning" that helped him survive the concentration camps was writing this book. And you feel it. 12) How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World by Harry Browne. I don\'t always agree with him (and I hate when people say that) but the philosophy has largely become a part of my writing. I guess same with "The Untethered Soul" by Michael Singer. 13) Born Standing Up by Steve Martin. I love standup comedy and to see this part of his autobiography basically taught me the art of autobiography and excellence. 14) No One Belongs Here More Than You by Miranda July. She is a love addict. I feel I am one also. Reading this collection of stories taught me how to write about it. 15) Person by Sam Pink and Spectacle by Susan Steinberg. Their entire personalities are reflected in their literally styles. I love when this happens. You can argue Thomas Pynchon and James Joyce do that also but I guess I might not like their personalities as much. 16) Tiny Beautiful Things by Cheryl Strayed. She invents the genre of literary compassion. I reread from this book before every Q&A I do. This is just a few. I just realized I can probably write 100 down. But these are particular to me. I\'m going to keep writing my 100 (in fact, I have a book club where I do exactly that). But you should try writing your 100. Figure out your influences and you begin to figure out your writing. Read your influences and you begin to figure your writing for TODAY. Then clean the table around your computer. Have a glass of water. Shut down the Internet. Write.'

S' THE BENEFITS OF MEDIOCRITYI used to think nothing bad could happen to me. This was confirmed repeatedly when I was a kid by my parents and teachers and, when forced to, my friends. Then one day I failed all of my finals my first semester of graduate school. I was no longer the golden child. The cowboy genius. Another day, a few years later, I cheated on a girl who wanted to marry me. And yet another day, I started a business while working at a full-time job, sometimes doing projects for their competitors.My parents crying, "I can\'t believe you\'re our son." At some point I had to make a decision - am I a bad guy or a good guy?I was afraid I was a bad guy. Confirmed later when I couldn\'t support my family. Or when I started to hide from my friends. Because I was in a prison of shame, more and more bad things happened to me. Now I don\'t know. Now it doesn\'t matter. I like to sit down and do nothing. That\'s my (almost) favorite activity in the world. Sometimes Claudia is sitting there with me also. I don\'t mind that. I like to be with my kids. 70% of the time it\'s because I love them. And probably 30% of the time it\'s because I don\'t want them to think I\'m a bad father. That will save them money on future therapy bills. Therapy being the one time you go to a doctor and you\'re never really supposed to be cured. Sometimes I judge others I see on the street. I think, "I don\'t want to grow up and be like them". And then I realize I\'m already older them and probably worse. But the person I judge the most is myself. All day long in my head, the chatter. I think the first step towards some sort of self-awareness is when you realize that voice is going non-stop. I think of this when people tell me they are a good judge of character. Almost everyone says they are a good judge of character. How can everyone be above average at this critical skill for life survival? At least half people must be below average. Similarly, in polls, 9 out 10 people think they are above average drivers. So clearly, self-delusion is good protection against mediocrity. Maybe the second step of self-awareness is to simply stop paying attention to that voice that is judging you. But it never seems to stop. Maybe 80% of the time it\'s judging me and 20% judging others. Or it might be thinking of a conversation with my parents that happened 20 years ago. They were wrong! Then it goes back to the present day, the conversation with the boss earlier. Or the co-worker. Or the girl at the store. The one with the nice eyes. The pre-frontal cortex evolved to help us adapt to new environments. It makes us smart so that we can reason out decisions when we are in an uncertain environment. But somewhere along the way we let it take over and run awry. "I\'m a bad person," it might tell me at three in the morning. It might torture me until I cry. How did I end up here?It might remind me of all the times I was fired. I could see all of their faces. Every boss firing me in anger: Bryan, Erik, Jim, Victor, etc. BAD! Or precisely 30 years to the day before I die it might remind me of that urgent email to something-something we have to return OR ELSE. Or why did I say X at the dinner? Now everyone will think I\'m boring. Or even worse - irrelevant. I\'m horrible at group dinners. Everyone is so witty and challenging and I just sit there. I have made a habit out of mediocrity. There\'s the saying, "stand next to the smartest person in the room". The flip side of that is to make sure you\'re never the smartest person in the room. I also don\'t want to be the best at whatever I do. I\'d rather steal from the best. Then I have more confidence I\'m doing the right thing. Anyway, I\'m mediocre and proud. And I use it to my advantage to occasionally get good stuff done. If I ever find myself above-average again I\'m very fortunate that at the very least I have my inner voice. Telling me, "ease up, soldier, things are not so simple. What you did yesterday was pretty atrocious." Ok. But we\'ll all be equal when our ashes spread like dust in a breeze. The breeze kisses all the ashes no matter what we did. And until then, I get to go to sleep early and let everyone else rule the world. All of you who passed the finals and were blessed with blue eyes.'

S' THE 22 CRITICAL THINGS I\'VE LEARNED FROM ELON MUSKI listened to every interview he ever did and compiled what I think are the most inspirational quotes to me. They may not be inspirational to you. Inspiration is somewhat of a risk: it takes you outside the world you once knew and introduces you to a new thought, person, idea, or something totally unexpected. So I wrote down the quotes and what I think I learned from them. Maybe as I think of them more I\'ll learn more. I don\'t know. Here are the inspirational quotes from Elon Musk that stuck with me: 1. If something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.I was thinking: what if it really is impossible. But Elon Musk then takes it to the next level always: "let\'s go to Mars". Or "let\'s make a billion dollar battery factory." So at the very least it\'s always worth exploring the delicious curvature of the impossible. 2. Going from PayPal, I thought: Well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? Not from the perspective, Whats the best way to make money?I\'ve interviewed over 100 people now on my podcast. Each of the 100 have achieved amazing results in their life. That\'s a subjective opinion. "Amazing" to me. But none of them have done if for the money. I was talking to Coolio, for instance, who had the best selling song of 1995. He started writing lyrics every day in 1977. It took him 17 years to have a single hit. "Never do something for the money," Coolio told me. 3. (Physics is) a good framework for thinking.  Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there.My guess is he is not referring specifically to the science and theories of physics but the act of visualizing something, coming up with an idea or a theory of why it might be true, and then figuring out how to prove that theory. To me, thats what physics is. Since the rules are constantly changing, which is another fascinating aspect of physics. 4. The first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.I wonder about this. What\'s impossible? Maybe a time machine is too hard to figure out. But to make an electric car you can imagine first a hybrid car that has a trunk filled with very efficient batteries so you don\'t ever need the gas part. Then it becomes a function of probabilities versus possibilities. 5. Its OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket.Many people think entrepreneurship is about risk. In fact, it\'s the opposite. Good entrepreneurs don\'t learn by failure (the popular "failure porn" all over the Internet). Good entrepreneurs learn by solving difficult problems. Elon Musk controlled his outcome with X . com not by destroying the competitor but by merging with it (paypal).  6. Persistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up.I always think this is the magic equation: persistence + love = abundance. You have to love something enough to persist. You have to persist enough to deepen your love. And then abundance is the natural outcome. Not just for you but for everyone. Since wealth comes to those who create wealth for others. 7. You want to have a future where youre expecting things to be better, not one where youre expecting things to be worse.This is incredibly important. News reporters have zero qualifications to inform people and yet they are all doom and gloom to sell subscriptions. But entrepreneurs are the ones who imagine a better world and how to make the leap to get there. 8. It is a mistake to hire huge numbers of people to get a complicated job done. Numbers will never compensate for talent in getting the right answer (two people who dont know something are no better than one), will tend to slow down progress, and will make the task incredibly expensive.When I was running a software company, we always knew it would take one great programmer to solve a hard problem in one night versus 10 mediocre programmers taking a month to screw up a problem even worse. 9. If you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic  being able to talk to people over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago.And now imagine what it will be like 300 years from now when people look back at today. "They had to actually \'connect\' to an Internet then!" or "It took them 7 hours to get from NY to CA!" 10. My biggest mistake is probably weighing too much on someones talent and not someones personality. I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.I recently watched a company go from a billion in revenues to zero when a founder stole $90 million from the company. Integrity, humility, and doing your best is by far the most important consideration when evaluating whether to work for someone. 12. When I was in college, I wanted to be involved in things that would change the world. Now I am.I always wonder about the phrase "change the world". Can one person change another. Perhaps the most valuable starting point is to do everything I can to change myself each day: to be physically healthier, to be around emotionally healthy people ,to be create, to be grateful. Then maybe I can have a head start on changing the world. 13. I think its very important to have a feedback loop, where youre constantly thinking about what youve done and how you could be doing it better. I think thats the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.I\'m invested in about 30 companies. The companies that fail are when CEOs smoke their own crack. Technology, competition, customers are constantly changing. But we have a cognitive bias to think that the activity we have invested the most time in is, of course, a GREAT activity. What could be wrong with it? So it\'s important to constantly question this evolution-based cognitive bias with constant questioning as if one were an outsider looking in. Without that, businesses fail. 14. I wouldnt say I have a lack of fear. In fact, Id like my fear emotion to be less because its very distracting and fries my nervous system.A small level of fear is motivational. It forces me to have a backup plan. The average multimillionaire supposedly has seven sources of income. They all have backup plans. Even Elon Musk has Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity, and probably a dozen other companies he\'s peripherally involved in. Any endeavor I do, I always ask two questions: "What is my plan B?" and "What is my evil plan?" Meaning what do I hope to learn from this that nobody else expects15. Life is too short for long-term grudges.I always think that I\'m the average of the five people I spend the most time with. So this quote is important to me. Don\'t spend time with people who can even incite a grudge. I try to spend time with the people I love and who love me.16. Dont be afraid of new arenas.Again, inspiration is a risk. It means stepping out of the comfort zone where you\'ve never been before. I try as an exercise to figure out at least one thing a day to do that is outside my comfort zone. One time I was talking to Noah Kagan and he suggested something simple: never time you go for coffee, ask for a 10% discount after they ring up your order. This sounds trite compared with planning a ship to Mars but it really made me nervous when I tried it. It was good practice. Maybe next thing will be the trip to Mars. 17. I think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.I thought about this when I read it. I think it\'s ok for "ordinary" people to be ordinary also. Ordinary is beautiful. But I think every day it\'s worth trying to be a little better (1%, an amount so small it can\'t be measured) in physical health, emotional health, creativity, and gratitude. Maybe that is a path to extraordinary as that 1% compounds. But I don\'t want the pressure of "future extraordinary". I just want to be a little better today18. I could either watch it happen or be a part of it.Sometimes people say to me, "I missed the boat" or "I am too late". I think it\'s never too late to do what you love."What you love is always on the shore, waiting for you to arrive, waiting with open arms.19. Being an Entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of deathPeople say to me, "I hate my cubicle. I want to be an entrepreneur." Entrepeneurship is a disaster. 85% of entrepreneurs fail and failure is not fun at all. Not to mention you have to deal with customers, employees, investors - they are all your bosses and not the other way around. Then you have to sell, you have to execute, you have to build, you have to exit, you have to grow. I like Elon Musks\'s approach of having many things to work on. Many Plan Bs. So any one entrepreneurial endeavor doesn\'t take up all the mind space.20. "I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact."I highly recomend Andy Weir\'s book, "The Martian". He self-published it. Then it got picked up by a major publisher. Now Ridley Scott doing the movie. Discusses this very topic.21. On his favorite book when he was a teen, "The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy": It taught me that the tough thing is figuring out what questions to ask, but that once you do that, the rest is really easy."Here\'s my favorite part of Hitchher\'s Guide to the Galaxy: the idea that all you really need from a materialistic perspective is a towel. Then the Universe sort of takes care of things after that. Hygiene is key22. "I just want to retire before I go senile because if I don\'t retire before I go senile, then I\'ll do more damage than good at that point.""Retirement" is an interesting word, invented by the actuaries who used statistics to come up with social security. So I doubt Elon Musk will ever retire. In fact, from a mortality perspective the two most dangerous years in life are the year you are born and the year you retire.------So I never interviewed him. But maybe read and watched several dozen interviews and wrote down my favorite quotes. Then I wrote what I learned from them. I want to learn from everyone. That\'s how I get inspired. If you don\'t agree with me, maybe you learned different things. But I like these quotes and I hope this somewhat fits the answer.'

S' 13 THINGS WAYNE DYER PERSONALLY TAUGHT MEI was scared to death. Wayne Dyer was going to come on my podcast. I read about ten of his books. I watched five or six of his PBS specials. The man has sold over 150 million books. He\'s inspired millions. He\'s already given 100s of interviews. What could I possibly ask him?I watched other interviews with him. I even spoke to his daughter about him. I wanted to be ready. I didn\'t want to ask the same questions everyone else was asking. "You have to interrupt him," Claudia told me, "or he will keep on talking." So probably the first thing is: I learned how to interrupt people. Afterwards, the guy who did the audio for the podcast said to me, "That was unbelievably inspiring." And then he quit his job. Wayne Dyer has worn many hats. He\'s been a therapist, a professor, a writer, a PBS fundraiser, to many a spiritual leader.I have no idea what he is. I think he wore many hats because in an interesting life, you do many interesting things. The dots don\'t always have to connect. To me he is the ultimate "Choose Yourself-er". He started out dirt poor, an orphan coming out of foster homes. He went to school, got his PhD, became a professor, and was so loved by his students he reached tenure by age 35, in 1975. Do you know what tenure is? It means the school has to pay you for the rest of your life. It means you never have to worry about a job or money again. You\'re set. So what did he do then? He quit.He had written a book "Your Erroneous Zones" and it failed in his eyes. It had sold 5000 copies. When a book sells 5000 copies the publisher typically wipes their hands clean (they have made a tidy profit) and says, "Ok, on to the next one." That wasn\'t good enough. He didn\'t want a publisher to choose whether he was a success or not. He quit his 100% safe job. Everyone said he was crazy and begged him not to. He bought out the rest of the inventory of books from his publisher and put them in the trunk of his station wagon.With his nine year old daughter sitting next to him he drove all over the country, from bookstore to bookstore, begging them to take his books. You choose yourself one choice at a time. You choose yourself every day. You choose yourself with all of your fears and hopes mixed together and nobody knows what\'s going to happen. But if you do it with a sense of mission, a belief in your vision, what happens may not be what you expect, but you will never say, "I wonder what would have happened?"He has sold over 100 million books since then. Before I did the podcast I spoke about Wayne Dyer to a friend of mine who I thought would be very skeptical. My friend is the CEO of a $200 million in revenues a year company. "Wayne Dyer is like a hero to me," he said and I was curious why. "Think of it this way: he\'s done 10 specials raising money for PBS. He\'s raised over $150 million for PBS." That is impressive, I said. "Yes, but that\'s not the point. PBS runs those pledge shows over and over. And PBS has higher ratings than all of the broadcast channels combined.Think about how much airtime and free advertising Wayne Dyer got for himself by doing those shows." I don\'t think that\'s why Dyer did those shows but it\'s interesting the perspective. There\'s nothing wrong with raising money, inspiring millions, and also helping yourself, is what the CEO was pointing out to me. If you go to my recent podcast list, the podcast is about two episodes ago. Here\'s 13 things Wayne Dyer told me that every day I learn from: A) DO WORK YOU BELIEVE IN SO MUCH YOU\'D GO TO JAIL FOR ITWhen Your Erroneous Zones came out it was banned in all of the countries behind the Iron Curtain. So Dr. Dyer smuggled copies into Prague. Thats how much he believed in the message he was spreading.B) LOOK AT YOUR LIFE FROM A DISTANCEDr. Dyer grew up in an orphanage, an incredibly hard experience and one that many people might not be able to overcome. But difficult experiences are what sculpt the soul. Now he\'s thankful, he told me, for those experiences. C) GO TO THE PEOPLE. At the beginning of his career, someone told Dr. Dyer The only way to reach everyone in America is by getting on a nationally syndicated TV show. "No matter how many times he contacted the big shows, they rejected me every time."So he packed his car full of books and drove across the whole country to connect with people face-to-face. Today everyone wants to go viral. They want the internet to make them an overnight success. But sometimes you just need to work insanely hard and go to the people. One at a time, face-to-face."Viral" often is a disease you want to get rid of. But "connection" can lead to lifelong benefits. D) ARRANGE WHATEVER PIECES COME YOUR WAY. He said everyone today is so eager to blame their situation on the stock market or the economy. But whatever meager resources you have, make it work for you. Find a way to move forward. He said that since he was 9 years old hes never been unemployed, even if it meant he had to carry bags of groceries at the supermarket for a nickel.The key to an enriched life is having a burning desire. Wayne says that you must have an inner flame that no matter what goes before you it never flickers. This desire will enable you to seize every opportunity and create the life you want to live.Dont let someone tell you you cant do XYZ because theres no money in it. "People used to tell me \'Dont be a teacher, you cant make any money doing it.\' ," he told me.But now he says hes a teacher with the largest classroom and the most amount of students. Every day, don\'t try to jump into another box. Just try to think a little bit more outside of the box society has put you in. E) ALWAYS TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN LIFE. Wayne says that If something isnt working in his life he always tells himself It must be because I havent used enough determination or I havent been fearless enough or I havent been willing to do whatever it takes to make it happen. He never lets himself make any excuses. Because even if there is an external explanation, he cant control external factors. He can only control himself. F) LEAVE YOURSELF OPEN TO WHATEVER COMES UP On June 26, 2013, Wayne announced to his whole family that he was done writing books. He explained in great detail why he felt like that chapter of his life was done. Then on June 27th he started writing his next book! He had 100% intended to be done with books, but when he felt the urge to start writing that morning he embraced it. Rather than resisting and forcing his own plans, he accepted what came his way and let it direct him.G) WE ARE \'DOOMED\' TO MAKE OUR CHOICES. There are somethings that we cant change. Our hardwiring, our bodies, our physical limitations. But within that framework we have the power to make choices. We choose how to use the resources we were given. Improving (or not improving) 1% a day is not even noticeable. That\'s why it\'s so easy for people to say, "nothing is happening" and inadvertently cost their lives 1% a day. Focus on that 1% improvement and everything changes. H) HOW TO FIND YOUR LIFE PURPOSE. You might be saying OK James, a bunch of these lessons are about following your purpose, but what if I dont know what mine is?! Wayne asked Whats the difference between good and God? The answer is o. Not just oh but zero. So whatever makes you feel good, whatever energizes you and lights you up inside, thats God. Thats God telling you that thats what you are meant to be doing.I don\'t believe that anyone has one purpose in life. And I don\'t like attaching any one religious philosophy to being content in life. But I like the idea of taking that "zero" and filling it up, if only for today, with something you love. I) SELL YOUR CLEVERNESS AND CREATE A SENSE OF AWE. Life is a gift. Dont let your ego get in the way of fully experiencing and appreciating it.When we were kids, we laughed and asked question. When we\'re adults, we cry and shout answers. Sometimes it\'s good to feel like a kid again, even at age 75.J) "THE #1 REGRET OF THE DYING IS \'I WISH I HAD THE COURAGE TO LIVE THE LIFE I WANTED RATHER THAN DOING WHAT OTHERS WANTED OF ME." Its hard living the life you want. It requires determination and strength and wisdom and fearlessness. And those are all difficult things. You only find the alternative waiting for you on your deathbed. K) ENLIGHTENMENTNot in a woo-woo, intangible way with no connection to the real world. Too many people try to scam with that word. "Enlightenment is all about improving your relationships. Being more loving with your spouse. Being more patient with your children. The quest for enlightenment is about improving your daily life in real ways."L) "THERE ARE 3 WAYS TO ENLIGHTENMENT" 1) Suffering: reflecting on pain in the past and learning from it; 2) Being present: learning from what youre going through right now; 3) Getting out front: being proactive rather than reactive.M) "THERE IS A SECRET GARDEN WITHIN US". No matter what happens in the world around us, no matter what happens to us, there is a place inside of you where you are 100% in control of what happens. "Maybe you cant control the terrible things that happen to you, but youre in control of how you respond." Youre in control of your feelings and your own happiness. Thats not to say that its not incredibly difficult, but the point is that NO ONE ELSE has the power over your mindset. "Inside your chest, you are sovereign."---I was sort of in a glow after the interview. I was excited. I felt like doing a podcast was the right thing. I wasn\'t sure until then. Maybe most of all I learned from one thing he said to me towards the end: "Are you willing to do whatever it takes to make the thing that excites you come true. Are you fearless?" I\'ll be honest: I don\'t know. Sometimes it\'s very hard. Sometimes crisis hits and you can\'t move. I think that\'s ok. Sometimes you have to take a rest to re-energize. But I have a faith that his final words to me are the trick: "Come from a place of compassion and love".'

S' FINANCIAL FRIDAYS: THE WTF! ON THIS STOCK MARKET \'CRASH\'Shit, I\'m about to break all the rules of selling and marketing but I don\'t care. People need to stop being fooled. It has to end.I write every day. I publish something here and on my email list maybe 5-6 times a week.These emails are very important to me and they are about 500-2000 words. Short, to the point, life lesson, anecdote, and what I love to do more than anything in the world.The emails go for free to about 200,000 people a day.But there are some messages people need to know to further enhance the work they are doing, whether its financial or starting a business, or part of my daily practice of physical mental emotional and spiritual health.I put my heart into that also.So I write up to 10,000 words once a month for that. That\'s probably too much. Almost like a mini-book. Too big for a Quora answer. For instance, this month, I write about 20 reasons for the crash and I found a super guest writer to basically write the BIBLE of angel investing.And I have about 10 people helping me research, do the tech infrastructure for this, etc. And the whole thing I sell for about $5 and some renewal rate a year from now with money back guarantees.But I\'m not writing this to sell. If the guys I work with find out (and they will once I hit publish), they will probably be upset at me.I\'m sorry: Jeff, Mark, Adam, Dillon, Tim, Emily, Mae, Mary, David, Garin, Peter. Don\'t buy it. I don\'t care.I just want to tell people how much BS the news vomits every day and how it\'s effected the markets.Instead of the 20 reasons I wrote this month, let me give the 3 or 4 most important (all 20 took up 5000 words, with another 5000 words on angel investing).A) CHINAChina growth is slowing. So the Wall Street Journal, which I used to write for, is saying "Chinese economy reeling".Oh my god. Please please please. Stop that.China is GROWING. It used to grow 10% per year because it was communism and 2 billion people were farmers.Now it\'s "going down" to 7% growth.Horrors! The world is over.But what if it continues?Who cares!?Guess how much we "sell" to China per year. I put "sell" in quotes because newspapers make it sound fancy and say we "export". BS economics writers.Less than 1% of our Gross National Product is sales is to China.So even if CHINA DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY the US would still have a growing economy.Oh, did I mention China is not disappearing. It\'s GROWING. At a faster rate than the United States.B) INTEREST RATES MIGHT RISEAre you kidding me?Let me explain simply please.The Fed lends money to banks. When the Fed rate is low, savings rates are low.When savings rates are low, people put money in higher risk stocks than in savings.When savings rates are high (7%+) people put money in their savings account because its safer (it really is).That\'s why people say "when interest rates go up, stocks go down."Oh my god! (sorry for the repeat).The Fed Rate is at 0.25% and has been for six years.They SHOULD raise it to 0.5% or even 2%. Nobody is saying, "Oh, now I should move out of the stock market and get 2% savings rates.And, by the way, the Fed only raises rates when every indicator suggests that companies are growing at a fast rate.Let\'s look at recent times the Fed raised rates. Through most of the 90s (the markets went straight up). 1999, the Nasdaq 100 went up almost 100% over the next year (and value stocks continued to go higher ever after the crash).From 2002-2007 the Fed raised rates every change it could get. The market went constantly up.And none of that was from such a low base of 0.25%.So newspapers, PLEASE STOP LYINGC) IS THIS LIKE 2009?In March, 2009, the market hit an all-time low.Fortunately, I ended it and saved the world. No kidding.I lived at 40 Broad Street, directly across from the New York Stock Exchange.On March 9 I went out and bought 100s of Hershey\'s chocolate bars. Chocolate encourages people to take risks and makes people happy.Chocolate makes people feel like they are in love. And willing to take risks.All of the traders walking into the exchange were depressed. They were all looking at the ground.I started to approach with my chocolates. At first the guards stood up and gripped their guns. Dogs were barking.But then I handed out chocolates. Traders would look up, smile, and take the chocolate. Nobody refused me.And yes, that day was the bottom of the market. I documented on Twitter before I started handing out and when I was done.It\'s not bragging if it\'s true.BUT, I can\'t take all the credit.People blame the 2009 crash on the housing crash. This is not true.Housing prices peaked in 2006. The housing crash was only one small piece of the puzzle in the 2009 crash.I won\'t get into all the details of how banks account for mortgage debt.But basically, the FASB (financial accounting services board) changed the rules mid-flight on how banks should account for their debt. It was a horrendously strict rule change that forced banks out of business.When did they make this rule change? Late 2007, at the peak of the market. Then the real crash happened: the banking crisis.Everyone begged them to change the rules back. When did they change it back? March, 2009. Coincidence? The market went straight up.----In my newsletter coming out on September 1 I give 20. I wish I could give all 20 here but there\'s not enough space.But three is enough. We covered the main issues: China, Interest rates, and the post-traumatic stress everyone is feeling about 2009.I admit I simplified but this is just a simple post. I\'m happy to answer questions and I go into more detail elsewhere.Finally I called a friend of mine who is the head of wealth management at one of the largest (top 3) banks in the world. He\'s the real deal and I just make status updates.He said, "our traders saw everything. Hedge funds trying to protect their fees would automatically trigger millions of sell orders and that kept triggering sell orders. But now it\'s done."I get it. I used to run a hedge fund. This is how it works.I don\'t know if it\'s done. Everyone says the "market crashed".Guess what. The market is FLAT in the past 12 months. What crash? So it can go up or down from here.But here\'s what we know at the very least:A) It\'s not about China!B) It\'s not about the Federal Reserves Interest Rate!C) And it\'s nothing like 2009!I wish I had room for all 17 items. But if all you know are these three, avoid the newspapers, take a deep breath and relax.The world is a hard place to live in.People always say, "you\'re the average of the 5 people you spend time with".But this is true also: "you\'re the average of the five things you read".If all you do is read newspapers (and the major ones lie the most) then you will mis-informed and in a constant state of anxiety.I know I was until I STOPPED reading them. Then I felt free.And then I ate chocolate. And then I fell in love.-----[Oh, and so Jeff, Mark, Adam, Mae, Mary, Emily, Tim, David, Dillon, Garin, Peter:Don\'t kill me, here\'s the link to the $5 offer where you get my book for free, the other 17 reasons, the text on angel investing, and all my back and forward issues, with a full money back guarantee.Choose Yourself For Success and Abundance 5s  The Altucher ReportBelieve me, I don\'t make anything on $5 and you can get your money back the second you download everything anyway.

S' HOW TO HIRE SOMEONE TO LOVE?One time I hired a friend to help me with a writing job. Then I fell hard for her. Then she got pregnant. Then she got an abortion without telling me. Then I found out she also had another boyfriend. And, by the way, she did a horrible job for me. -----In my first businesses, one of my partners was my sister. Ultimately she didn\'t like one of my decisions and she quit. Her last email to me was, "I never want to speak to you again for the rest of my life."And she has lived up to her word. ----When you build a business, or you are doing work that is important to you: you shouldn\'t hire people you love. Because love might hide the things that are very important for you completing your job. I might love someone who can\'t spell. So I shouldn\'t hire them to spellcheck. Claudia, my wife, works with me on a lot of projects. We even do a podcast together.But that was after years of relationship where we got to know each other and what we were good at and what we were bad at. If I were to disappear tomorrow, she could probably pretend to be me. If she were to disappear tomorrow, I would be lost. So she\'s hired! But, sadly, she can\'t spellcheck.----But this post is not about hiring loved ones. It\'s the reverse. It\'s about finding the people you love by using a hiring process. Recently I read the book "Who". The authors had interviewed over 20 billionaires, 30 CEOS, and dozens of recruiting managers and then developed a process of hiring. They then tested the process over and over again to see if it brought the right people into a business. I don\'t care at all about their process for hiring. I\'m glad it works for them. Good luck. When I read their book, I realized I used their process in personal relationships! Wife, friends, work friends, close ties, weak ties, etc. So here it is. A) SCORECARDList all the features you want for a particular relationship. Like, for a wife: I want someone who doesn\'t cheat. For a friend, I want someone who doesn\'t lie to me. I make a list of ten things for each "position". When I was first dating after I got divorced I did not have a scorecard.So I met women who were interested in all sorts of things that had no interest for me. Women who were interested in dating other guys at the same time. Women who were more focused on my belongings than who I was. Women who liked me but wanted to see what else was better. Women who wanted me to dress a certain way, or even women who wanted me to like having ten cats in my house and five babies. I have nothing against any of these people. One woman I really liked once got super drunk at a party I invited her to. I have nothing against that. But then her breasts fell out of her dress and she never noticed. I got her out of the party. And she kept laughing at me, "Your friends only like you because they think you have money. They\'re idiots and you\'re an idiot." And maybe she was right. But we broke up. She is now happily with someone else high up in the banking industry and I am happy for her. She is also running her own company. Very successful and a very good person. But not for me. I was very very unhappy. I got drunk every night. I kept asking myself, "am I crazy? Does nobody exist who has the simple qualities I want?" So I made a scorecard. I made my list. Did I find her? I think I came pretty close. Argentina was originally discovered by pirates escaping who needed a place to escape the British. Well, Claudia is my pirate and stole my heart. I use a scorecard now for everything. Friends, acquaintances, work friends (who are every bit as important to me as friends), people who I will do business with (who are also friends, else I won\'t work with them. Period.), and so on. It\'s only in the past few years I\'ve realized that each role has different criteria. If they don\'t fit the criteria they are probably not good for that role. Probably not good for me. For instance, friends around the neighborhood are different than work friends. Both are very important to me. But both have different roles. Selfishly, I only want people around me who are good for me. Is there anything wrong with that? B) SOURCEYou can meet a woman in a bar. In a yoga class. Or a book club. Which would you choose? It really depends on your scorecard above. But just because you have a scorecard doesn\'t mean you will find what you want. You also have to look in the right places. Whenever I\'ve looked in a bar, disaster resulted. Whenever I\'ve looked in a chess club, I\'d only meet men (who became good friends). I meet friends by making sure I go to places where the people have some similar values to me. So I don\'t go to a hockey game (there might be good friends there but it\'s not a good SOURCE). Or I might go to a conference where people are focused on improving themselves. Or , to be honest, since I so freely express my own values in my writing I tend to like the people who gravitate to my writing. There are a lot of studies that "weak ties" (not your close friends but people who might be friends of friends or acquaintances or Facebook friends, etc) are more beneficial for your career success than your "strong ties". I don\'t know the reasons for this. We can all guess. But I spend a lot of time cultivating my weak ties. Being there for people who I barely know but maybe have that one moment where I can help. I keep in touch with my weak ties. This is also a great way to build the SOURCE for people who might later become strong ties. It\'s worked for me many times now. Also, if someone falls off the scorecard, it gives me a chance to distance myself while still having them in the pool of the source. This all sounds very clinical. Ugh. Like science. But I do wear a lab coat when I write. So I am Dr. Love. C) SELECTYou have a SCORECARD and a SOURCE. But not everyone in the source will fit what you want in your life. There\'s only so many "openings" to fill. You can\'t have a room filled with great friends and lovers every day. Maybe there\'s only room for one lover. Three or four great friends. Ten medium great friends. And 100 weak ties. So you want to make sure you Select well, given your scorecard and your source.So I make lists of questions I want to know. Given the 1000s of bad experiences I\'ve had (see "face down drunk on Lexington Avenue at 3 in the morning" article or "the time I lost 7 million dollars in one day article") I now make sure people meet the criteria. Else, a lot of time, money, and heartbreak can be lost. I hate heartbreak. And I hate losing time and money. This doesn\'t happen in one day, or in one interview. But many experiences with a person. And since there are 7 billion people to mostly choose from, it\'s not so bad if someone you think makes the cut, falls off after one or two strikes. If you pick your Source correctly, then you have many people to go back to. If you select your weak ties correctly, then there are many people to go back to. One time I hired a friend to work for me at a company. Then I found out he went to my boss and tried to have me fired. So, even though we had been friends for years, I made sure he got fired. Almost instantly. There\'s a saying, "Everyone deserves a second chance."My response to this..."not really." D) SELLYou have the right scorecard. You have the right Source. They\'ve made it through the Selection process. Now what? Well, you have to Sell them that YOU are a good person to love, to be friends with, to get to know better, to be a strong tie or a weak tie, or a help when they need it. How do you do that? You can\'t tell them. You can\'t say, "You can trust me".That\'s what real estate agents and stockbrokers say. Do you trust them? You can only show by example. I was talking to Tucker Max and Dr. Geoff Miller recently. They are about to come out with a book called "Mate", about the evolutionary psychology behind how people choose their spouses (and other mating partners). In the book they say that some times the most effective words you can say are not, "I love you" but "Don\'t worry. I\'ve got it." People want to know you are effective at what you say you can do. That you are not the Emperor who wears no clothes. That your word is gold.That you don\'t gossip about others (because then you might gossip later about them).That you don\'t take things personally when you shouldn\'t (I often do that, and when I do - I\'m very hard to deal with as Claudia tells me). So you show, through time, that you are the person they want to be around. My favorite technique. I always try to "over promise and over deliver". When I\'m doing anything: a talk, an event, a book, a post, a trip, lending a helping hand, I always ask myself, "am I over promising and over delivering". Not under promise and over deliver. That\'s for corporate losers. Over promise and over deliver means you learn, other people get helped, and you exceed even your own expectations of what you can do in your life.You become bigger. And you earn the trust of others. And it\'s scary and hard and takes you out of your comfort zone. So I guess it all boils down to what\'s good for you. Even when you SELL, you do it by improving yourself. I guess what I am saying is: I\'m grateful this post is in your scorecard, in your source, that you\'ve selected read it, and I hope I am over delivering. I\'m also grateful to the random people interviewed 30 CEOs and then wrote a book about it. They accidentally gave me a technique to find my loved ones. Maybe you can use this to choose the people you surround yourself with. Try making the lists described above.What\'s your scorecard, your source, etc.Or you can say, "this is garbage"It\'s your choice. But I hope we can be at least weak ties, and maybe friends.'

S' 10 LIFE-HACKS, 10 LIFE-HABITS, 10 META-HABITSImagine a piece of meat. Put some bones underneath it, cover the bones with muscles and nerves and skin. Put on two pairs of eyes and a mouth (but not too big a mouth, those are annoying). Take a huge needle and inject life into it. It\'s going to hurt at first. But that\'s what needles are for. This is what our robot masters did when they began what they call "The Great Experiment" and created us. "What if they find out," they said to each other. "Don\'t worry," said the chief scientist who then laughed to himself. "They are so deluded, that each one of them thinks they are important and have a purpose in life."They are just a bunch of skin jobs". Much later, one of the robot masters, Ridley Scott, used that same phrase in the movie "Bladerunner". ---Then they give us the ability to make other little "tubbies". I like calling little things "tubbies". When I first had a new little tubby around I thought she was very annoying. She was like a new roommate that would cry and not speak English and want food all the time and vomit on me. If she really were a roommate, I would have asked her to not even worry about next month\'s rent. "You just threw up on me and tried to suck my wife\'s breasts. Please get the hell out of here." But that\'s wishful thinking. She can\'t even understand English. Kids are not life hacks. They are life attacks. But we can\'t avoid them. I don\'t know why. They happen. ---As soon as we hit the ground, we want tricks. We want money and sex as quickly as possible. And maybe fame. There are "life-hacks" - things that you can do today to improve your life tomorrow. These work for awhile but then you get tired of them.Then there are "habits" - things you can start today that will improve your life 10 years from now. Habits are difficult though. Because if you are only improving a tiny bit each day you won\'t notice them. You\'ll think nothing is happening. So you\'ll stop. I hate habits. It\'s so hard to remember to do them. So you need "meta-habits" to keep reminding yourself to do the habits. Advice is autobiography. And even though I mostly fail in life, here are 10 life-hacks I try. 10 habits. 10 meta-habits. I\'ve written about some of these before. Who can resist writing about life-hacks involving $2 bills. But I will be more concise and not always explain the reasoning. Just trust me that they work. If you\'ve seen these before, please skip. I don\'t want to bore you. If you haven\'t seen them before, you can figure out why these life-hacks work. Put them in the comments and I\'ll respond. LIFEHACKS1. Carry $2 bills with you everywhere. Tip with them. Nobody forgets a person who tips with $2 bills. You can order $2 bills at your bank. 2. Wear a lab coat in airports. People will let you go past them in line. 3. Carry waiter\'s pads with you. Use them to take notes in meetings. Use them to write down your ten ideas a day. Use them as business cards. People will think you are frugal and clever. And it\'s always a good conversation-starter. People will say, "I\'ll take fries with that burger" and I\'ll leave it up to you to come up with a witty response. 4. Mirror people. I was talking to Nick Morgan, author of "Power Cues". When he was younger he had an accident which changed his brain. He could no longer tell how people were reacting to him. So he made a lifelong study of body actions and what they mean. For instance, he told me. "If you want people to like you, then very subtly mirror all of their moves. If they cross their legs, cross your legs a few seconds later. If they wipe their forehead, wipe your forehead." "Won\'t they notice?" I asked. "No," he said, "People are too focused on themselves to consciously notice what you are doing. That\'s why you have an edge." "Then," he said, "after 15 minutes, reverse it. "You wipe your forehead first. See if they then wipe theirs. You start leading the actions. If they start following you it means they like you and will start to follow your suggestions." I haven\'t tried this yet. If you try it, please tell me if it works. Nick Morgan gave me a few more suggestions on my podcast the other day. 5. Oh, one more from Nick. "Figure out the bottom end of your vocal range and the top end. Speak about 1/4 above your bottom end. If you do this in a meeting, you will dominate the meeting." Ok, I\'ve tried that a bit with Claudia. Not sure it works with a wife. "Do the laundry," she said. But maybe she was using her bottom range when she said it also. Duel of the bottom ranges. 6. Memory Hack. To remember things, you need more than one emotional hook. I\'ve spoken to memory champs Jim Kwik and Josh Foer. They both told me this. For instance, if you can\'t remember "James Altucher" also think "James I\'ll Touch Her" and picture me touching a beautiful woman (go ahead, imagine that). Now you have two hooks into my name. The more hooks you have, the more parts of your brain are at work. The easier it is to remember lots of things, like a room full of names. Or "Claudia Azula" (my wife), I think of a blue monster ("azul" is blue in Spanish) clawing at me. 7. "There\'s always a good reason and a real reason". This always works. If I ask an employee, "why\'d you do it this way?" they\'ll give a complicated, but good answer. Like, "I felt these paints looked good with that blue." But the real reason might be "I was too lazy to get new paints." For everything everyone says, including me, there\'s a good reason (which is hard to argue with) and a real reason. Always look for the real reason. 8. 80/20 rule cubed. Everyone knows that 20% of your employees (or 20% of your efforts, or 20% of the seeds planted), produce 80% of the value (or 80% of your profits, or 80% of the flowers that blood). But let\'s square it. So you apply the 80/20 rule on top of the 80/20 rule. And let\'s square that. So now 1% of your prior efforts produce almost 50% of the value. I tried this in my life. I used to make a lot of phone calls each day to find out how different businesses I was invested in were doing. Now I make 0 phone calls. Result: nothing really changed.Occasionally someone would call me and ask for advice (the 1%) and value would result (the 50%) but it gave me back a huge chunk of my life. HUGE. And I\'m much happier. And pretty much I get the same results. Nobody really wanted to talk to me anyway. 9. No News. This is really a subset of the 1/50 rule above. I used to get my news from newspapers. I\'d read 3-4 newspapers a day and then read online. That would take about two hours of life each day. Now I scan down what\'s trending on twitter. Takes me about two seconds. People always say, "no news is good news". Now....I always have no news. So it\'s always good news Some people have gotten angry at me over this. Like, "how can you change the world if you are so uninformed."To them I say, "Blah!" And it doesn\'t matter. I\'d rather read a book then read about 9 children being killed in Kazakhstan. That\'s depressing!It\'s not like I\'m going to go to Kazakstan and save anyone\'s life. But if I\'m a good person, then perhaps other people will follow my example. And so on. Until it reaches Kazakstan. That\'s the most effective way to consistently change the world. 10. Never say "Hello". Ask a question instead. Even if it\'s the first time you are meeting someone. Like, "Why did you get divorced?" Or "Do you think you can beat me in a fight"? What does "Hello" mean anyway? 11. One more life-hack. ("Over promise and over-deliver")How to cut the 10,000 hour rule by 90%. K. Anders Ericsson and Malcom Gladwell have popularized the idea that it takes 10,000 hours of practice with INTENT to be the best in the world at something. Intent means, measure your success, give yourself feedback, and try to better your results at every attempt. If you just play cards for 10,000 hours, you won\'t get better. but if you study with a teacher, read books, figure out how to measure your success, and analyze your failures, that\'s "practice with intent". 10,000 hours is roughly 10-20 years of hard work. It would be nice to cut it down. Here are my two ideas on this, which I\'ve applied in my life. First off, you don\'t need to be the best in the world to be better than everyone around you. The learning curve is steep but the final 10-20% is very flat. That\'s why it takes young tennis players a few years to get in the top 200 or the top 1000 but then it takes them another 10 years of hard work to be in the top 10. In the ENTIRE WORLD. So if you take 1000 hours. You\'ll be better than just about everyone you can possibly imagine encountering. For instance, take Scrabble. It might take you 1000 hours to remember all the 3 letter words, all the 4 letter words with Js and Qs. All the 6 letter "Stems" (a stem is six letters that, if almost any other letter is added, you have a legal 7 letter word, e.g. S A T I N E. Add "X" to that and you have "Antisex". Add "E" to that and you have "Etesian" and so on. There are about 20 useful stems). It will take you about 1000 hours to do that plus learn basic strategy and then you will be among the best in the world. But not THE best. I used to tape word lists to my kid\'s stroller when she was born. At night she couldn\'t sleep unless I was running full speed with the stroller. But that\'s ok, I was memorizing stems. But now let\'s cut the 1000 hours even more. If you combine two areas of interest then you don\'t even need 1000 hours. Let\'s say I\'m interested in computer programming and the stock market. I can learn basic programming. I can learn the basics of the stock market. And then I can program patterns in the stock market ("What happens if the market falls 5 days in a row") and if I program a few hundred patterns I can see if any results happen that are statistically significant. This won\'t make one a great trader. But it\'s a start. If you intersect two areas, it will be much faster to be in the top 1% of the two areas because other people will also have to pick those exact two areas. Maybe then you need only 500 hours of practice with intent instead of 10,000 hours. Damn, I\'m going to have K. Anders Ericsson on my podcast to see if I\'m right. HABITS12. Sleep 8-9 hours a day. This one is so obvious it\'s ridiculous. At night you are tired so your brain feels you\'re druggy and your movements are slow and sluggish. When you sleep, BAM! Your brain is re-energized and you have new energy that can last you an entire day. There is a ton of research on this. For instance, the average professional violinist sleeps 8.6 hours a day. I\'ve worked with people who tell me they only need three hours a day. Then they also tell me they are bipolar. If you are too busy to sleep 8 hours a day then find micro-habits you can stop so you can sleep more Else you will die earlier. Like...don\'t watch TV at night. Get blackout drapes. No screen time after 7pm. Don\'t eat too late. Whatever you can do. You have to sleep 8-9 hours a day. 13. You\'re the average of the 5 people you spend your time with. If you want to be funny, spend time with funny people. If you want to be a criminal, spend time with other criminals. If you want to be stabbed in the back at work, spend time with people who gossip a lot. (I hope you are not the average of these five people)14. Don\'t Eat Sugar. 15. Move. 16. Small CelebrationsIf you only wait for something big to happen ("I made a MILLION dollars!") you\'re going to be waiting for long periods of time before you can celebrate. Find more things to celebrate. Celebration is fun. And there\'s some brain research that blah blah blah when you celebrate. Today I will celebrate that Claudia and I had an argument over the weekend but we made up. 17. Write 10 Ideas a DayAgain, advice is autobiography. Doing this habit has changed my life every six months. For instance, in the past six months, I finished a book. I started a new podcast (both are coming out September 1), I started a high-level advisory service for people interested in the economy (coming out September 15), I gave a talk in London I never expected to give and I met many new friends. 18. Be grateful.Blah. This is a boring one but it actually works very well. The other day I was very upset about something. Claudia and I were in an argument. It\'s hard to be married for long periods of time without being in an argument. Maybe Jesus can do it. But I can\'t. And when I\'m in an argument with Claudia, it\'s the worst thing in the world. I feel all closed up. Like I can\'t breathe. So it was hard to feel grateful but I still tried. Maybe that helped get me out of my cave. Bit by bit I found myself more grateful for things. And then I was able to crawl out of my cave. 19. HygieneI was talking to Tucker Max and Dr. Geoff Miller, THE smartest evolutionary psychologist on the planet. They said that many people ("mostly men") fail because they don\'t clean themselves. Tucker said to me, "James, just go to a hair salon, throw down 200 bucks, and tell them to make you look good." (I\'m fine with how I look actually). I don\'t think I\'ll do that. But showering, brushing teeth a few times a day, changing clothes, cutting finger nails, washing face...all of this seems obvious. But sometimes I spend days in a house by myself and forget to do these things. I know that sounds gross. But it feels good when I focus on hygiene. 20. Treat Everyone Like You Are Their Mother. A friend of mine says that when she is around the Dalai Lama "it feels like he is treating everyone like he is their mother". So this seems like a good habit to have. When I think of someone I randomly meet and I change my mindset to pretend like I am their mother, I become more concerned for their happiness, their comfort, their careers, their ability to find people they love. I judge less. I treat them with honesty and I am more open to them. This one thing has changed my life. When I\'m walking in the street, though, I have to be careful not to smile at too many young boys. 21. HonestyNot radical honesty, which is bullshit. Just because you want to have sex with your girlfriend\'s sister doesn\'t mean you have to broadcast it everywhere. Just: if you say something, then it\'s either true to you, or you live up to what you say. This maybe is the most important habit. Honesty defines your character. And character defines your future. People want to deal with honest people more than they want to deal with smart people. So honest people get more opportunities for money and sex and fun things. What can be better? META-HABITSI forget what number I\'m on and I don\'t feel like scrolling up. I don\'t have a mouse and I hate using the mousepad. I\'m going to make up a number. 25. Oh, why do we need meta-habits? Because habits are hard. So you need habits to get habits. I call them meta-habits. 26. By the way, I made #25 an entire meta-habit because simply being aware that meta-habits are important is a meta-habit. 1% a day. The problem with this meta-habit is that it\'s not noticeable. If I want to get 1% a day better at baseball it\'s almost impossible to notice. Nothing might change from day to day, as far as I can tell. So you have to be gentle on ourself. And just have the mindset that the goal is improvement, not a number. Just 1% a day improvement. You can also choose to decrease 1% a day. That\'s what most people do. Ahh, I can\'t write today, so I\'m going to read the news and eat junk food. One day won\'t matter. Oh, but it does. It does! 28. Kindness. Do it and reward it. Punish non-kindness. If you are kind, people will want to be around you. If you reward it (by smiling, or saying something nice) then people will want to be kind to you. If someone is not kind to me, then I back off. No matter who they are. I don\'t even let family be not-kind to me. Once we die, they are not my family anymore. This is how you get the "five" that will help you "be the average of the five people around you". 29. Net-netEveryone wants to go on a strict diet. "I will NEVER eat carbs!" Or whatever your favorite macro-nutrient is to hate. Always remember that whatever macro-nutrient you avoid, there\'s an entire society made up of octogenarians who have been eating that food group all of their lives and they are completely healthy. So whatever you do, whatever you eat, whoever you hang out with: if net-net, there\'s more good than bad, then that\'s a good start. And, as you do that, you\'ll find your net-net weighs more and more on the side of what is good for you. For instance, if I have a plate of fruits, vegetables, and a cookie or two - net-net that is pretty good for me even if the cookies are not so good. Mmmm, I love cookies. The key is, if it\'s good in general not to judge people, then it\'s probably good to not judge yourself too harshly either 39. Failure = Experiment. People think "failure is good". Sometimes I even say that. Failure is not good. Failure is the worst. Failure is the mother and father of more failure. Thomas Edison did not fail 10,000 times to make one lightbulb. He did 10,000 experiments. Everything we do today is an experiment. Sometimes it\'s disappointing if an experiment doesn\'t work out. But that\'s ok, we experiment again. You can use this meta-habit when you build a business. Don\'t build a business and see if it works. Try this idea first: put up ads on Facebook or Craigslist or wherever for your product or serve. Use a small budget. See if people click. If a lot of people click then you might have a good business idea. If nobody clicks, then move on to the next idea before you build anything. That\'s a good way to experiment instead of building a whole idea and then watching it go down in flames. By the way, my spellchecking thing spelled "idea" as "ride" at first. That works also. We\'re all on a ride. Sometimes we pass each other on intersections and we wave hi. Waving "hi" is fun. Then we move on. Life has many crossroads. And we all get to choose which path we can choose at the crossroads. Nobody else should choose it for us. That\'s the most important habit, life hack, metahabit of all. Otherwise we\'ll crash.'

S' I wrote the worst book ever when the world was crashing and more people than ever before in history were committing suicide. Specifically, December 2008, banks were shutting down, the stock market had it\'s worst fall ever in history, everyone was losing jobs, homes, families. That month I published a book on investing. It sold 291 copies. It was the worst timing on the worst book in the worst period in recent history. I also lost my house and my wife. So one time my kids were visiting me. I made them come up with me from bookstore to bookstore. Every book I could find, I signed. And I would put weird little notes on each book. Like, "If you buy this book you will make a Zillion Dollars!" Or, "If you buy this book, I will grant you three wishes!" And then I would sign my name. Then I would put the book back on the bookshelf. I was hoping someone would buy the book. I was hoping I would get RICH! One time I wrote a very particular message on the book. My 6 year old daughter even looked at me when I wrote it and said, "Daddy, what are you doing?"And I said, "Maybe someone will buy the book because of that message." It was raining outside. I took them across the street from the bookstore, up to the second floor of a building and there was a magic show going on. In the middle of the world collapsing I was glad there was still magic. ---Move forward six months. None of my books sold. My publisher wouldn\'t return my calls. I had been fired from my job. I was getting an official divorce now. And my kids would visit me on the weekends. I was drinking every night and getting really fat and I was constantly sick. Plus I was broke. In other words, a perfect catch. Maybe I would spend three or four hours a day on online dating sites. That\'s how hard a guy like me would have to work to get even one response on a dating site. Hundreds of messages. Finally, one woman responded. I won\'t get into the details of our first few dates. But I liked her. In fact, because of the low levels of emotional maturity I had, I even thought I loved her. Maybe it was true. Maybe it was true. One time she offered to cook me dinner. So we were going to meet in a bookstore near the train station and then go to her place and she would cook. I was late. She remembered I mentioned that even though my last book was about investing, it had a lot of personal stuff written in it. So she went looking for my book, hoping they would have some. Not suprisingly, they had not sold a single one of my books in the prior six months. They had about eight of them there. The same number that was there six months earlier when I was signing the books next to my six year old. She pulled one of the books off the shelves. She was going to read it until I got there. She flipped it open to the first page and saw that I had already signed the book. She couldn\'t believe the message over the signature. She thought maybe I had arrived at the bookstore first and was playing a trick on her. She looked around. Nobody was there. She looked in the next aisle. Was he here? No, I was late. Now she and I have been married for the past five years. I am so happy about it. I look at her and think, how did this happen? Part of the reason, I suspect, is that she believes in signs from a force above. And perhaps that force above had forced my hand when I wrote a message in that one particular book. What I wrote in that book that day, with the world collapsing and even my six year old thinking I was crazy: "I LOVE YOU - James Altucher".---'

S' I\'m really glad you asked. I am the luckiest guy ever. I\'m so lucky I\'m not even afraid to jinx myself by saying it out. Like standing up in a movie theater and saying to everyone, "I am the luckiest guy ever". Often when people do something like that, they stop being lucky. They take it for granted after that. That won\'t happen to me. I\'m lucky at the cellular level. My cells don\'t even really know English so they aren\'t listening to me. But when people say "luck" they mean many things. Like, have I won the lottery? Yes. Yes I have. Maybe not some specific Lottery with a $100,000,000.00 prize but I have won many lotteries in life. Am I lucky in love. Yes. Yes I am. I am (thank you very much) on my second marriage. She is a very wonderful woman. Many people look at her and then look at me and say, "What the hell was she thinking?" My ex-wife is extraordinary also. She gave me two great kids. Sometimes they love me and sometimes they are very angry at me. But when they get angry I usually laugh at them (I\'m just being honest). It\'s almost ridiculous to me when a 16 year old gets angry. Am I lucky in business? I just had an investment fold on me that cost me $7 million. That doesn\'t seem so lucky. I\'ve started 20 businesses and 17 of them failed. That doesn\'t seem so lucky.But I have yet to open the inside of this ticking clock we call the Universe. Who knows what was in store for me if those businesses haven\'t failed?Perhaps something would happen to my wife? Or I would get sick (something that has not happened to me in a very long time. Knock on wood). I don\'t have a billion dollars. Or even one hundred million. I used to think I would only be happy if I had one hundred million dollars. I once had a company I started that was all set to go public. The banks that were taking me public said I could be worth up to $900 million if we went public. Unfortunately, they didn\'t take us public. Bad things happened. I was fired as CEO. Then fired from the board. Then I lost all my shares. A few years ago it was bought and I made nothing. BUT...if it had gone public...I had it all planned out. I was going to use $2 million of my money to buy a Super Bowl commercial. In the commercial I was planning on just walking around and doing nothing. I would take up 60 seconds of empty Super Bowl space for no reason at all. But I was a little nervous. What if I did that and suddenly everyone would protest and say, "James should have given that money to charity!"I would actually wake up at night sweating about that. That is not very lucky. Wishing and Luck are the opposites. Once I wished for $100,000,000.00 I instantly went broke. And when I say "Instant" I mean: about a million dollars a week I lost for 15 weeks in a row. I would cry at night. I couldn\'t get out of be. My ex-wife would offer to make pancakes and I would actually refuse (pancakes being wildly known as the secret recipe the aliens left us before they took off for distant galaxies). And then I was dead broke and lost my house and eventually my ex-wife and then my self-respect and all my friends and on and on. All because I wished for something. Nobody is entitled to anything. Every atom in my body existed during the Big Bang 14 billion years ago. They made it this far. They don\'t need me to make a certain number. They will all be around one trillion years from now. Dear Atoms On My Body, will you even remember me? Answer: Probably not. We don\'t even have memories. One time I was going broke a few years ago. Again. It would have been maybe my fifth time living out of a garbage bag. I hit my chest and said, "Abundance!" and then within months an investment I made came through and I made money. I didn\'t think about it. I just said that word and stopped thinking about money. Did that make me the money? No. That\'s stupid. Of course it didn\'t. And if anyone saw me hit myself they probably (and correctly) should have put me in a mental hospital. A lot of bad things are happening in the world. People getting blown up. I suppose it\'s a cliche to say I\'m lucky because I\'m not one of them. But that\'s always the case. Every one of us can find someone worse off and someone better off. And it\'s built into our mammallian evolutionary machinery to keep track of our "status" in the tribe. Even if the tribe is now seven billion people. So that\'s not really luck. Although I\'m grateful bombs didn\'t blow me up today. So how can I say I\'m lucky? Lucky in what? Three things: - COMPETENCE: Every day I try to improve at the things I love. I love writing for instance. So I read a lot and try to write a lot. Some days I get better and some worse. The worse I get, the luckier I am. How come? Because it means I\'m trying something stupid and seeing if I can get away with it. That\'s how I learn. "Getting worse" is powerful feedback. LUCKY PEOPLE are grateful for bad results. Because they use that feedback to get better at the things they love. - RELATIONSHIPS My second wife loves me I think. And if she didn\'t that would be okay also. I\'m trying to get better at separating out results from love. I love her, so if she wanted to be somewhere else, I would love that about her. Then I will always be lucky in love. I am one of the ugliest people on the planet. And yet, because I practice good loving, then it\'s easy for me to be happy with all the relationships around me. And guess what then happens? Because of that, all of the relationships around me keep getting better. - FREEDOM. I can do whatever I want. I can\'t jump ten feet. But I don\'t want to. Don\'t make me. I\'ll say "no".I\'ve been rejected by a lot of jobs and opportunities. I won\'t deny it. I wanted to do those things. But I have a trick: I diversify the things I want. Maybe I won\'t be a billionaire today. But I KNOW I will kiss someone today. And I KNOW I will sleep ten hours today. And I KNOW I will write most of today and maybe see my kids and maybe see a movie. Every day, because I diversify my choices, I find freedom in everything I do. And I never do anything I don\'t want to do. What if I had to go to a bad job! Many people have to go to jobs they don\'t like. I will tell you a story. A friend of mine was an artist. We were walking in the rain. He pointed down and said, "what do you see?" I said, "a puddle." He said, "ok, look again". I looked down and I saw a puddle, and I saw people reflected in the puddle. And I saw the sky reflected in the puddle. And I saw the chaotic edges of the puddle and how they were constantly changing. And I saw the edges of a rainbow creep into the puddle as it reflected the light in unusual ways. My artist friend taught me how to see. Art is the gap between bad luck and good luck. "A bad job" is the first answer. But the second answer is when you start to see. Can you create luck? Yes. I\'ll show you. If you\'ve ever read me before you can stop reading now. Do this every day. But only 1% growth a day. Too much and it\'s too hard. Too litttle and it\'s not enough. It\'s like you don\'t care about luck. Physical: Just do 10 pushups a day, five times a day. After you do this for awhile. Maybe (the 1% growth) add a pushup. Or a squat. Or whatever. Sleep eight hours. Lucky people are always well-rested. How else will enjoy your luck. Eat well. Every cell on your body has come from something you ate over the past seven years. So make sure your body is all set for luck by eating well. What is eating well? You know! Don\'t deny it. Emotional: Be nice to the people around you. Find someone new to be nice to. Maybe 1 person a day. Just now I looked at an article I wrote in 2007. Someone wrote a nice comment on it. I never responded to the comment. So I looked up the person to see where they are now. And I wrote them a nice thank you letter. Thank you! Thanks! is a good way to get lucky. Mental: I started getting lucky when I sat down with a pad every day and I wrote down ten ideas a day. Every day...ten more ideas. Sometimes I would send the ideas to people. And then some of those people would call me and invite me to help them make those ideas. The more ideas I wrote, the better I got at it. It\'s like practice. Spiritual: I once met Thich Naht Hanh, the Buddhist monk who has been an anti-war protester since the 60s. He has seen so much sorrow. And so much pain. And yet he was smiling. Then he did a calligraphy in front of me. He drew a circle. And he spelled out the word: "smile". Spirituality is not about prayer or a god or a hope or a wish or meditation ("mad attention"). It\'s about: can you smile right now? If the answer is "yes", then you are practicing being spiritual. It\'s all practice. It\'s all about 1% improvement every day. How do I know there aren\'t people luckier than me in the world? I don\'t know. Maybe there are. But I doubt it. Because we\'re in a giant video game that I created. I put myself in here to play a character. I\'m the only person alive. So that makes me the luckiest person alive. Smile! Flash!'

S' I visited Google a few weeks ago and, after almost getting arrested, my mind was blown. First, Claudia wandered into the garage where they were actually making or fixing the driverless cars. When they finally realized she was wandering around, security had to escort her out. We got scared and we thought we were going to get in trouble or thrown out. Then we met with a friend high up at Google and learned some of the things Google was working on. Nothing was related to search. Everything was related to curing cancer (a bracelet that can make all the cancer cells in your body move towards the bracelet), automating everything (cars just one of those things), Wi-Fi eveywhere (Project Loon) and solving other "billion person problems". A problem wasn\'t considered worthy unless it could solve a problem for a billion people. So now Alphabet is aligning itself towards this strategy: a holding company that owns and invests in other companies that can solve billion person problems. It\'s not divided up by money. It\'s divided up by mission. I want to do this in my personal life also. Just analyzing Larry Page\'s quotes from the past ten years is a guidebook for "billion person success" and for personal success. ----Here are some of his quotes (in bold): "If you\'re changing the world, you\'re working on important things. You\'re excited to get up in the morning."To have well-being in life you need three things: A) a feeling of competence or growth. B) good emotional relationships. C) freedom of choice. Being able to wake up excited in the morning is an outcome of well-being. Feeling like every day you are working on a billion-person problem will give you those three aspects of well-being. At the very least, when I wake up I try to remember to ask: Who can I help today? Because I\'m a superhero and this is my secret identity. ------"Especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change."Too often we get stuck in "good enough". If you build a business that supports your family and maybe provides for retirement then that is "good enough". If you write a book that sells 1000 copies then that is "good enough" You ever wonder why planes have gotten slower since 1965? The Dreamliner 787 is actually slower than the 747. That\'s ok. It\'s good enough to get people across the world and save on fuel costs. It\'s only the people who push past the "good enough syndrome" that we hear about: Elon Musk building a space ship. Larry Page indexing all knowledge. Elizabeth Holmes potentially diagnosing all diseases with a pin prick. Isaac Asimov wrote classic science fiction like "The Foundation Series" but it wasn\'t good enough for him. He ended up writing 500 more books, writing more books than anyone in history. Larry Page keeps pushing so that every day he wakes up knowing he\'s going to go past "good enough" that day. What does your "good enough" day look like. What\'s one thing that moves you past that? -----My job as a leader is to make sure everybody in the company has great opportunities, and that they feel they\'re having a meaningful impact and are contributing to the good of society. Whenever I\'ve managed companies and have had the small opportunity to be a leader I\'ve judged my success on only one thing: Does the employee at night go home and call his or her parents and say, "guess what I did today!" I\'m not sure this always worked. But I do think Larry Page lifts all his employees to try to be better versions of themselves, to try to surpass him, to try and change the world. If each employee can say, "who did I help today" and have an answer, then that is a good leader. Empowering others, empowers you. ----------------------"Lots of companies don\'t succeed over time. What do they fundamentally do wrong? They usually miss the future."The stock market is near all time highs. And yet every company in the original Dow Jones market index (except for GE) has gone out of business. Even US Steel, which built every building in the country for an entire century, has gone bankrupt. Never let the practical get in the way of the possible. It\'s practical to focus on what you can do right now. But give yourself time in your life to wonder what is possible and to make even the slightest moves in that direction. We\'re at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, we\'re still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think a lot of that is because of the negativity... Every story I read is Google vs someone else. That\'s boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don\'t exist.Sometimes I want to give up on whatever I\'m working on. I\'m not working on major billion person problems. And sometimes I think I write too much about the same thing. Every day I try to think, "What new thing can I write today" and I actually get depressed when I can\'t think of something totally new. But I am working on things that I think can help people. And if you are out side of people\'s comfort zones, if you are breaking the normal rules of society, people will try to pull you down. Larry Page didn\'t want to be defined by Google for his entire life. He wants to be defined by what he hasn\'t yet done. What he might even be afraid to do. I wonder what my life would be like if I started doing all the things I was afraid to do. If I started defining my life by all the things I have yet to do. -------"Many leaders of big organizations, I think, don\'t believe that change is possible. But if you look at history, things do change, and if your business is static, you\'re likely to have issues."Guess which company had the original patent that ultimately Larry Page derived his own patent (that created google) from?Go ahead. Think a second. Guess. An employee of this company created the patent and tried to get them to use it to catalog information on the web. They refused. So Robin Li, an employee of The Wall Street Journal, quit the newspaper of capitalism (who owned his patent), moved to China (a communist country), and created Baidu. And Larry Page modified the patent, filed his own, and created Google. And the Wall Street Journal got swallowed up by Rupert Murdoch and is dying a slow death. -----"I think as technologists we should have some safe places where we can try out new things and figure out the effect on society."A friend of mine is writing a novel but is afraid to publish it. "Maybe it will be bad," he told me. Fortunately we live in a world where experimentation is easy. You can make a 30 page novel, publish it on Amazon for nothing, use an assumed name, and test to see if people like it. Heck, I\'ve done it. And it was fun. Mac Lethal is a rapper who has gotten over 200 million views on his YouTube videos. Even Ellen had him on her show to demonstrate his skills. I asked him, "do you get nervous if one of your videos gets less views than others?" He told me valuable advice: "Nobody remembers your bad stuff. They only remember your good stuff." I live by that ------"If we were motivated by money, we would have sold the company a long time ago and ended up on a beach"Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to be academics. When they first patented Google, they tried to sell to Yahoo for $1 million (ONE MILLION DOLLARS). When Yahoo laughed them out the door, they tried to sell to Excite for $750,000. Excite laughed them out the door. Now an ex-employee of Google is the CEO of Yahoo. And the founder of Excite works at Google. Google dominates. Money is a side effect of trying to help others. Trying to solve problems. Trying to move beyond the "good enough". So many people ask: "how do I get traffic?" That\'s the wrong question. If you ask every day, "How did I help people today?" then you will have more traffic and money than you could have imagined. ------"Invention is not enough. Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. You have to combine both things: invention and innovation focus, plus the company that can commercialize things and get them to people."Everyone quotes the iconic story of Thomas Edison "failing" 10,000 times to get the electric lightbulb working. I put failing in quotes because he was doing what any scientist does. He does many experiments until one works. But what he did that was truly remarkable was convince New York City a few weeks later to light up their downtown using his lights. The first time ever a city was lit up at night with electricity That\'s innovation. That\'s how the entire world got lit up. ----"If you say you want to automate cars and save people\'s lives, the skills you need for that aren\'t taught in any particular discipline. I know - I was interested in working on automating cars when I was a Ph.D. student in 1995."Too often we get labeled by our degree and our job titles. Larry Page and Elon Musk were computer science majors. Now they build cars and space ships. David Chang was a competitive golfer as a kid, majored in religious studies in college, and then had random gopher jobs in his 20s. The gopher jobs all happened to be in restaurants so he became familiar with how the business was run. Then he started probably the most popular restaurant in NYC, momofoku. A dozen or so restaurants later, he is one of the most successful restauranteurs in history. Peter Thiel worked as a lawyer in one of the top law firms in NY. When he quit in order to become an entrepreneur, he told me that many of his colleagues came up to him and said, "I can\'t believe you are escaping". Escaping the labels and titles and hopes that everyone else has for us is one of the first steps in Choosing Ourselves for the success we are meant to have. We define our lives from our imagination and the things we create with our hands. ----"It really matters whether people are working on generating clean energy or improving transportation or making the Internet work better and all those things. And small groups of people can have a really huge impact."What I love about this quote is that he combines big problems with small groups. A small group of people created Google. Not Procter & Gamble. Or AT&T. Even at Apple, when Steve Jobs wanted to create the Macintosh, he moved his small group to a separate building so they wouldn\'t get bogged down in the big corporate bureaucracy that Apple was becoming. Ultimately, they fired him for being too far from the corporate message. Years later, when Apple was failing, they brought him back. What did he do? He cut most of the products and put people into small groups to solve big problems. Before his death he revolutionized the movie industry, the computer industry, the music industry, TVs, and now even watches (watch sales have plummeted after the release of the Apple Watch). All of this from a guy who finished one semester of studying calligraphy in college before dropping out. Studying the history of Apple is like studying a microcosm of the history of how to create big ideas. Larry Page is recreating this with his new corporate structure. -----"We don\'t have as many managers as we should, but we would rather have too few than too many."The 20th century was the century of middle-class corporatism. It even became a "law" called "The Peter Principle" - everyone rises to their level of incompetence. One of the problems society is having now is that the entire middle layer of management is being demoted, outsourced, replaced by technology, and fired. This is not a bad or a good thing (although it\'s scary). But it\'s a return to the role of masters and apprentices without bureaucracy and paperwork in the middle. It\'s how things get done. When ideas go from the head into action with few barriers in the middle. To be a successful employee, you have to align your interests with those of the company, come up with ideas that further help the customers, and have the mandate to act on those ideas, whether they work or not. That\'s why the employee who wrote much of the code inside the Google search engine, Craig Silverstein, is now a billionaire. Where is he now? He\'s an employee at online education company, The Khan Academy. ------If you ask an economist what\'s driven economic growth, it\'s been major advances in things that mattered - the mechanization of farming, mass manufacturing, things like that. The problem is, our society is not organized around doing that.Google is now making advances in driverless cars, delivery drones, and other methods of automation. Everyone gets worried that this will cost jobs. But just look at history. Cars didn\'t ruin the horse industry. Everyone simply adjusted. TV didn\'t replace books. Everything adjusted. The VCR didn\'t shut down movies. The Internet didn\'t replace face to face communication (well, the jury is still out). ---------"What is the one sentence summary of how you change the world? Always work hard on something uncomfortably exciting!"Not everyone wants to create a driverless car. Or clean energy. Or solve a billion person problem. But I have a list of things that are uncomfortably exciting to me. They are small, stupid things. Like I\'d like to write a novel. Or perform standup comedy. Or maybe start another business based on my ideas for helping people. Every day I wake up a tiny bit afraid. But I also try to push myself a little closer in those directions. I know then that\'s how I learn and grow. Sometimes I push forward. Sometimes I don\'t. I want to get more comfortable with being uncomfortable. -----"I do think there is an important artistic component in what we do. As a technology company Ive tried to really stress that."Nobody knows what the definition of Art is. How about: something that doesn\'t exist except in the imagination, that you then bring out into the real world that has some mix of entertainment, enlightenment, and betterment. I don\'t know. Something like that. Certainly the iPad is a work of art. And the iPad has created works of art. And when I first saw a driverless car I thought, "that\'s beautiful". I\'m going to try and put my fingerprint on something today. And maybe it will be art. -----"The idea that everyone should slavishly work so they do something inefficiently so they keep their job  that just doesnt make any sense to me. That cant be the right answer."We\'ve been hypnotized into thinking that the "normal life" is a "working life". If you don\'t "go to work" then you must be sick or on the tiny bit of vacation allotted to you each year. What if everything you did you can inject a little bit of leisure, a little bit of fun into it. I have fun writing, except when I think I have to meet a deadline (work). I have fun making a business that people actually use except when I think about money too much (work). When you are at the crossroads and your heart loves one path and doesn\'t love the other, forget about which path has the money and the work, take the path you love.------------"We want to build technology that everybody loves using, and that affects everyone. We want to create beautiful, intuitive services and technologies that are so incredibly useful that people use them twice a day. Like they use a toothbrush. There aren\'t that many things people use twice a day." What a great idea for a list of the day!What are ten things that can be invented that people would use twice a day?------"You need to invent things and you need to get them to people. You need to commercialize those inventions. Obviously, the best way we\'ve come up with doing that is through companies."I was speaking to Naveen Jain, who made his billions on an early search engine, InfoSpace. He just started a company to mine rare earth minerals on the Moon. But his real goal is extra-planetary colonization. Somehow we got around to the question of why have a company in the middle of that. He has billions. He can just go straight for the colonization part. He said, "Every idea has to be sustainable. Profitability is proof that an idea is sustainable." "You may think using Google\'s great, but I still think it\'s terrible."K. Anders Ericsson made famous the "10,000 hour rule" popularized later by Malcom Gladwell. The rule is: if you practice WITH INTENT for 10,000 hours then you will be world-class. He then wondered why typists would often reach a certain speed level and then never improve no matter how many hours. After doing research, its because they forgot the "With intent" part. They were satisfied with "good enough". You have to constantly come up with new metrics to measure yourself, to compete against yourself, to better the last plateau you reached. Google is great. But it can be better. Having this mindset always forces you to push beyond the comfort zone. Once they changed the way typists viewed their skills (by recreating the feeling of "beginner\'s mind") the typists continued to get faster. We have a mantra: dont be evil, which is to do the best things we know how for our users, for our customers, for everyone. So I think if we were known for that, it would be a wonderful thing.Many people argue whether or not Google has succeeded at this. That\'s not the point The point is: Values before Money.A business is a group of people with a goal to solve a problem. Values might be: we want to solve a problem, we want the customer to be happy, we want employees to feel like they have upward mobility, etc. Once you lose your values, you\'ll lost the money as well. This why family-run businesses often die by the third generation ("Shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations). The values of the founder got diluted through his descendants until the company failed. I spoke to Dick Yuengling about this (CEO of the largest independent beer maker and a fifth generation business). His family found an interesting way to solve the problem. The business is not inherited. Each generation has to BUY the business from the generation before it. To do that, each generation needs its own values, its new way of doing things that keeps the brand fresh and ongoing. --------------"I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. Since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. In fact, there are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name."Our parents have our best interests at heart and tell us how to be good adults. Our schools have our best interests. Our friends, colleagues, sometimes our bosses, sometimes government, think they have our best interests. But it\'s only when everyone thinks you are crazy that you know you are going to create something that surprises everyone and really makes your own unique handprint on the world. And because you went out of the comfort zone, you\'re only competing against the few other people as crazy as you are. ----------------You know what it\'s like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream? And you know that if you don\'t have a pencil and pad by the bed, it will be completely gone by the next morning. Sometimes it\'s important to wake up and stop dreaming. When a really great dream shows up, grab it.For every article I\'ve ever written, there\'s at least ten more I left behind in the middle of the night thinking I would remember in the morning. I have to beat myself in the head. I . Will. Not. Remember....Must. Write. Down.It\'s hard to wake up. And that\'s the only thing worth remembering. It\'s hard to wake up. ----------------"I have always believed that technology should do the hard work - discovery, organization, communication - so users can do what makes them happiest: living and loving, not messing with annoying computers! That means making our products work together seamlessly."This is a deep question - who are you? If you have a mechanical hand, is that "you"? Conversely, if you lose a hand, did you lose a part of you. Are you no longer a complete person? The complete you? If an implant is put into your brain to access Google, does that effect who you view your self to be? When books were invented, memory suffered. We no longer had to remember as much, because we can look things up. Does that make our brains less human? I bet memory has suffered with the rise of Google. Does this mean our consciousness has suffered? When we created fire, we outsourced part of our digestion to this new invention. Did this make our stomachs less human? With technology taking care of the basic tasks of our brain and body, it allows us to achieve things we couldn\'t previously dream possible. It allows us to learn and explore and to create past the current comfort zone. It allows us to find the happiness, freedom, and well-being we deserve. -----------"Over time, our emerging high-usage products will likely generate significant new revenue streams for Google as well as for our partners, just as search does today. "This is it. This is why Larry Page has re-oriented Google into Alphabet. Don\'t waste your most productive energies solving a problem that now only has incremental improvements. Re-focus the best energies on solving harder and harder problems. Always keeping the value of "how can I help a billion people" will keep Google from becoming a Borders bookstore (which went out of business after outsourcing all of their sales to Amazon). How does this apply to the personal? Instead of being a cog in the machine for some corporation, come up with ways to automate greater abundance. Always understand that coming up with multiple ways to help people is ultimately the way to create the biggest impact. Impact then creates health, friendship, competence, abundance, and freedom. Oh my god, this answer is too long. And believe it or not, I cut it in half. If I can just wake up every day and remind myself of these quotes by Larry Page I know I will have a better life. But this is also why he created Alphabet and put Google underneath it. To save the world. To save me.'

S' Getting a degree wasted five years of my life. I got an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. Then I went to graduate school for Computer Science but I left after two years. I put in my 10,000 hours of programming. I knew how to build an operating system. I could take apart and put together a computer. If I lived in the 1800s I probably could invent computers. I thought I was good. When I got my first job in "the real world" I was a programmer. My second day on the job I crashed the entire network and lost everyone\'s email. My boss came into my cubicle (very embarrassing since everyone in the cubicles around could hear and would later gossip) and said, "We really want you to work out but it\'s not so we are going to send you to remedial school on computers." I drove two hours every day to go to a remedial class in computer programming. I learned how to program then and eventually started three software companies. The above is not saying "colleges are bad". There are many aspects. The above just says: here is what I learned, here is what good it did me. Did it even get me that first job? No. I failed the interview miserably. I knew the answers to none of the questions. What got me the job was this: After the interviews I was depressed. I went into the part right outside of work and there were people playing chess. I played one of the guys in chess. He\'s now a well-known poker player. I beat him. When I looked up, my boss\'s boss\'s boss (the one who gave me the toughest interview) was there. It turned out he was a very good amateur chess player. "I never saw anyone beat Ylon before" he told me. And then we took a walk around the park and talked about man y things other than work. Two weeks later he offered me the job. He even offered me a signing bonus. Later that day, my then-boss started yelling at me about something insignificant. He didn\'t know that I had just been offered a job. I held up my hand and said, "that\'s fine. I don\'t like to be yelled at, though, so I quit. Goodbye." He couldn\'t believe it. He apologized. He wrote me an email and apologized. I wrote back, "don\'t treat people how you don\'t want to be treated." And I still quit. Six years later when I was running a venture capital firm he even pitched me a deal. I said, "Let me call you back on that." And I never spoke to him again. So this is my story of college to establish some credentials. But let me tell you pros and cons. This is the honest truth: Pros: 1) You have sex a lot. There are no parents around. For me, I had a girlfriend for the first time. There\'s nothing to prevent you from doing anything you want. So you do it. A lot. 2) You drink. I had never had alchohol or drugs before college. By the end of my three years in college (I graduated a year earlier thanks to summer classes because I wanted to save money) I had gotten trashed many times and had tried marijuana and LSD. 3) For the last time in your life you continue to make friends who are your exact same age and demographics. When I was 19, my friends were 19. When I was 20, my friends were 20. Now I\'m 47. My friends range in age from 24 to 84, all different nationalities and sexual preferences, etc. This is real life. College is just extended high school. I can\'t think of any other "pros". What about an education. I\'ve been reading a few books a week since I was 23. It wasn\'t until I left college that I learned to appreciate reading. When you are force-fed books to read and facts to remember it\'s very hard to enjoy them. Imagine being locked in a cage and force-fed chocolate all day. You\'d soon get sick of it. NEGATIVES1) COST and DEBTThis is usually cited as the biggest negative. It isn\'t the biggest negative but I will put it here anyway. The average college-educated person age 18-35 made $36,000 a year in 1990. Now that same average person makes $33,000. This is taken right out of tax data. And yet, student loans have gone up from almost nothing to $1.4 trillion. If you are 25, have a great idea that can change the world, and want to start a company, how will you do it if now you have to be chained to a cubicle to pay back your debt? You can\'t even declare bankruptcy to get rid of your debt. With one hand, the government feeds you to the slaughterhouse (college) and with the other, they seize all of your assets. It\'s a great business to be in if you can get it. 2) CHEAP ALTERNATIVESThe other day I spoke to Scott Young. For $2000, and in ten months time, he got an MIT Computer Science degree. How did he do it? They put their entire course load online. Maybe this will stop at some point. They do it because they know people still think it\'s worth it to spend $200,000 to do the exact same thing Scott did but still get that piece of paper that says "BS". When employers were asked, "would you hire Scott even though he doesn\'t have the actual degree?" (he took all the courses and tests but of course could not get a degree) many of them said, "yes. He has initiative." Many schools put their curriculum online. Then there are online-only schools like code academy, lynda, coursera, udemy, creative live, fedora, etc etc. where you can take GREAT courses. 3) OPPORTUNITY COSTI loved computers. But what if, instead of spending five years learning the academic version of computers (and then still having to take remedial classes), I had just simply started working with computers? Maybe even starting a business? Who knows?Many other well-known software companies started by 19 or 20 year olds started that way. What if I had done it? Instead I had to wait 5 years before even considering it because i was using the most valuable time in my life to take classes that taught me nothing. I\'m not bitter (see the Pros) but I often wonder what would have been different. What if you are not a scientist? Doesn\'t matter. My daughter wants to study acting. Why can\'t she just spend that time going to auditions and getting real roles. I spoke to Mark Messick recently. He\'s 16 years old, dropped out of school at 11, and now makes $4000 a month writing books. Living the dream. He still goes to extracurricular activities at his school to maintain his friendships, but other than that he is light years ahead of his classmates in education and opportunity. 4) BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LIBERAL ARTS? There was a study done: quiz students 1 minute after they get out of class and then 50 minutes after they get out of a class. After 50 minutes they had almost zero retention of what they learned in the class. The only way to learn something is to have a passionate interest in it, then learn it, then repeat it, then try to teach it to someone else. This is not something taught in school. Kids are taught facts and not questions. And yet questioning the world is how all knowledge is learned. After college, 80% of people never pick up a book again. If you just read 5 pages a day (10-20 minutes of time. The time it takes to read People Magazine) of something you are interested in, you\'ll read 1800 pages more per year than everyone else. For the next 50 years. This is a good way to learn "liberal arts". 5) BOGUS INCOME STUDIESMany universities, to tout their benefits, have done the exact same study. People who got a degree, 20 years later, have made up to $500,000, give or take, more in their career then people who didn\'t have a degree. This is a spurious study. It has no control group. It\'s based on a demographic from the 1970s and 1980s when people from middle class families went to colleges and people from lower-class families, often didn\'t. This could be the entire reasons for the income difference but the studies need mention that. Here\'s a study: take everyone who got accepted to Harvard. Tell half of them you can\'t go to college ever. Instead, get your four year head start on making money. Then see who has more money 20 years later. 6) ITS NOT A SAFETY NETI ask my kids: why do you think it\'s good to go to college. Despite my insistence (maybe because of it) they still think it\'s a good idea to go to college. They both say the same thing, "it\'s a safety net so you can get a job". "Who tells you this?" They have no answer. It\'s just in the air. Forget the income numbers I cite above. There are changes happening. Just this past week, Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, said they will no longer care if an applicant has a college degree. Google has said they will stop looking at it. More and more people will stop looking at whether or not you have a college degree. WHAT SHOULD I DO INSTEAD? - Study many things. Study things you enjoy. If you don\'t enjoy anything, work on a charity or travel the world (yes, this costs money but it\'s cheaper than college). - Work at a job. If you want to be a doctor, work at a hospital and see if you really enjoy it. - Read every day. Five pages a day. - Learn these skills that are critical in every aspect of life but are never taught in college;  a. Sales b. Negotiating.  c. Well-being / Positive psychology d. Failure e. CommunicationI was at a dinner once. Someone who was working for Mayor Bloomberg asked me, "Would you let someone who didn\'t go to college give you brain surgery?" I said, "It\'s not about me. Would you let your son who has no interest in being a doctor, go to four years of school and another years of medical school just so he can operate on my brain even though he hates every minute of it and gets a million dollars into debt?" The average person has 14 different careers in their life. But now because of the costs and the debt, they are chained to that first career forever. Make the choices that allow you to cast away the chains as quickly as possible. You have a mission here. Fly out of the nest and accomplish it.'

S' My eight year old daughter is crying right now. Shes trying to draw manga-style comic book figures. The eyes look stupid! she says, and the arms look flimsy! My oldest tries to calm her down, Mollie, Im three years older than you. Thats why my characters look so good, she says, but somehow that doesnt work and it doesnt help when my oldest says, Mollie, guess what, I finished drawing on the whole pad? Arent these pretty?I tell my youngest, Mollie, look on the Internet and see how other artists do their eyes and arms. I bet there are some Manga artists who even have videos on how to do it.She says, but thats copying. I dont want to copy. I refuse.So I tell her my favorite quote from Picasso, Good artists copy. Great artists steal. And my oldest says, that would mean HE stole. And I tell her thats right but still my youngest refuses to listen. She says, I dont want to copy. I want to do something completely original.But thats impossible. Just about every idea worked on now is a result of the following recursive formula:NI(X) = NI(1) + NI(2 )+ NI(3) + MIWhere NI = new idea and NI1, NI2, etc equals various new ideas as of yesterday. And MI which could be a tiny component of the whole equation, is My improvement. Which, again, might be minimal, or zero, at best.Examples: telescope. Galileo stole the telescope. He took the original invention by Hans Lippershey, made it a bit longer and more powerful and gets full credit 400 years later for the invention. telephone. Who invented the telephone? Well, Alexander Graham Bell of course? But only after the looked at the failed patent Antonio Meucci filed in 1874 (Meucci was too poor to send in the $10 patent charge. Sopatent denied. Enter Bell). relativity. Einstein stole part of the theory of relativity from Poincare. Poincare published countless papers on relativity that Einstein had studied before his own first book on relativity. Einstein cited hundreds of sources but didnt mention Poincare once. Do the research but there are several instances of direct plagiarism in his initial book on relativity. Search. Google. Not quite a steal in the sense of the above but the entire concept of a search engine was dead and over by the time Google hit the scene. My little story on this: A company called Oingo came calling one of my partners one day in 2000 or 2001. I forget which year, thats how little impact it made on me. They were working on some algorithm for matching ads with web pages on search engines, or something like that. They needed funding badly. We almost couldve named our price. I said, because I was the resident genius, No way. Isnt the entire search engine business dead? Somehow they survived, changed their name to Applied Semantics and were bought by a tiny search engine company with no revenues called Google. The Oingo algorithm became Adsense which accounts for 99% of Googles revenues. The Applied Semantics deal wouldve been worth about $1bb  $2bb by now. Suffice to say, Google built on the backs of everyone from Lycos to Oingo to Altavista, etc. Superman. Captain Marvel, which was first put out by Fawcett Comics in 1940 was of course a direct ripoff of Superman and yet became very successful.And Superman himself may have been a plagiarism of sorts. 5 years before the first Superman came out, Jerry Siegel (Supermans creator) reviewed the book Gladiator about a boy growing up in rural America who had super powers.Siegel claimed in 1940 that Gladiator had not been an inspiration. He did not at that point note his 1932 review of the book. Decl of Independence. Thomas Jefferson directly plagiarized John Locke when he wrote the Declaration of Independence. James Madison even admitted later: The object was to assert, not to discover truths. Chess. Bobby Fischer learned Russian when he was 14 years old so he could steal ideas from the Russian chessplayers in the magazine 64. He used those opening ideas to win the US Championship at the age of 15 in the mid 1950s. Art. Roy Lichtenstein directly stole from the cartoon strip True Romance to repackage and then resell for (now) millions. Star Wars. Whether you call it inspiration or plagiarism, George Lucas took ideas from everything from Taoism to Asimovs Foundation series, to Joseph cambell, Greek Mythology, King Arthur, etc. Vonnegut. Kurt Vonnegut said he cheerfully ripped off the plot of Brave New World for his novel, Player Piano- and Aldous Huxley, in turn, stole it from Eugene Zamatians We Groupon and every other business. Almost all current successful internet businesses are the result of lifting (and improving) the ideas from past businesses. Groupon is a direct descendant of the failed Paul Allen company, Mercata (remember?). Facebook (remember Geocities? Or, heaven forbid, Tripod). And why didnt the World Wide Web Worm: succeed (the first search engine that I can think of).  Comedy. In standup comedy, stealing (or improving on) routines has been common. Robin Williams was constantly accused of this early in his career and his reply was that he was so stream of consciousness he sometimes had no idea where the ideas were coming from (i.e., they were coming from his friends even minutes after their acts). Bill Cosby has admitted stealing some jokes from George Carlin, Rosie ODonnell was known to borrow from Jerry Seinfeld early in their careers. Sam Kinison has accused Bill Hicks of joke thievery who, in turn, has accused Denis Leary of stealing parts of his routine. 3AM. I personally think Comedy Centrals show Insomnia is somewhat a ripoff of my III:am idea for HBO (particularly since I pitched the idea to Comedy Central first).Unfortunately, stealing is not a shortcut to success. Stealing is THE ONLY PATH to success.How do you steal? Try this. Pick a field you are passionate about: whether its blogging, romance novel writing, comedy, internet entrepreneurship, art, cooking, cancer research, etc. Read everything you can about the field. Heres what you have to read minimally:At least the history of that field from 1800 on. Try to read at least 10 different sources on the historyAll of the latest blogs in the field. Try to have 100 different sources here.All the basic techniques the current leading experts in the field use. Read all of their biographies or autobiographies. Pick your five favorite sources in the field. For instance, if I wanted to write a novel: Id pick my five favorite novelists. If I wanted to start a business in local Internet Id pick my five favorite local Internet companies. If I wanted to blog, Id pick my five favorite bloggers. If I wanted to be a management consultant, Id steal directly from Peter Drucker, Jim Collins, etc. Get one element that you like from each source. What element do you think stands out that makes them a success. Add your own improvement. Or not. You can even start out with a direct copy and throw in your twist at the end. Ignore all the haters. The more people hate you, the more money you will make. Trust me on that.Im hoping Mollie grows up and learns how to be just as good a thief as her dad.See what else I stole at Altucher Confidential'

S' Martin Luther King nominated Thich Nhat Hanh for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1967 and hes a buddhist monk and peace activist.And when he was standing right in front of me tonight I was blown away by what he said.We went to an opening for an exhibit of his calligraphy.He looked like a child. He smiled like a child. He talked like a little boy. It was almost funny to look at.Heres some things he either said or drew that I learned from.How to Do What You Love.He starts his day with tea, he said. And he loves calligraphy. So he puts the tea in the ink and starts his drawing.Funny, I thought. He combines the things he loves. But then he went further.He said he imagined his fathers hand was on his when he drew, and that he loved his father.And that all his ancestors hands were on his when he drew. And all his students hands and all the people he knew.He showed a drawing of a circle. He said that the circle was made out of smiles.He didnt say do what you love. But he showed that if you love something, heres how you do it.You pour all of your love into it. You hold nothing back.He laughed when he said that. But the woman next to me was crying.Peace can only come from peaceful people.Here we are on the eve of dropping more bombs on people in order to establish peace in a region that we know nothing about.Peace seems hard, which is why I guess we never get it right. Its not a fight but more like something that is shared.Understand your own suffering.Stop everything for a moment and really think about your own suffering, he said.Your own moments of hitting bottom. This, he said, was how compassion is created. Compassion then cradles the suffering like a mother cradles a baby.And this is then how you learn to have compassion for the suffering in others. The pain we all feel. The loneliness we all feel. The regrets and uncertainty.Every breath is a miracle.It proves we are alive again! and he laughed.During the day I sometimes think my breathing is so shallow when Im on the computer I have to stop to take a deep breath.I just read in the book Crazy Sexy Cancer that how we breathe can help us battle cancer.No mud, no lotus.This phrase was on one of his calligraphy drawings.The lotus flower is beautiful, but comes from the mud. Just as compassion often comes from suffering. The lotus shows the true value of the mud.He started a small meditation by ringing a bell.By coincidence, a company Im on the board of is going on the Nasdaq tomorrow. Im very proud of them.So at 9:30 Im going over to the Nasdaq and the CEO of the company will ring the bell to start the days trading for thousands of companies.Both Thich and the CEO use the ringing of the bell to stop us for a moment. To start something new and amazing. Its all connected.I learn the same thing from both Thich and this CEO. Nothing can stop you when you pour all of your love into the things you do.'

S' Heres a rule of the universe: when you envy someone, you put a wall up between yourself and the things about that person you envy. If they have a good job, theres now a new wall between you and getting a good job. Why? Because you are programming yourself to dislike people who havegood jobs. So how will you get one? Unless you like disliking yourself.Clearly envy is bad. What you have to do is train your envious mind. Everytime you notice yourself thinking an envious thought about say, Alice try to catch yourself doing that and then reverse it.Think: God bless Alice. I am sincerely happy she has been able to make these achievements.Reminds me of a story I read as a kid. Two guys are walking past the Executive Lunchroom at some Big Company. One guy says to the other, look at those assholes eating there.The other guy says, I like them eating there. Because one day I will be eating there as well.Without envy, the entire world is open to you. With envy, you just put a line in the sand, and youll never cross it.'

S' I\'ve interviewed at least 100 dominatrixes. Which makes me an expert on something but I\'m not sure what.The math I use to get there is straightforward. The first time I had to do an interview it was for my HBO web series "3AM" 18 years ago. The idea was this: if you were out on a Tuesday night at 3 in the morning, I was going to find you and interview you.Why Tuesday? Because Saturday is too obvious (you were enjoying a night out on the town). And Tuesday, well, let\'s just say you were up to something. No judgement!I was really scared the first time. And the second time. And the 100th time. And 18 years later during podcasts I\'m still nervous every time I\'m about to interview someone.But for those 3am shows I would pretend I was an actor and that I knew the people and I would just go up to them and say, "Hey, how\'s it going?"I wore my HBO jacket and there were video people behind me so the subjects would get a little bit shocked and then I would explain what I was doing.The key was this: within the first 15-30 seconds I had to get them so comfortable that they had to be able to tell me their deepest secrets.People were cheating on their spouses (both men and women), people were looking for drugs, or were teenagers scared of their parents and police, or were simply completely insane. There were drug dealers, prostitutes, every sort.One time I took my assistant with me to be the production assistant on a shoot. She said (I love you Trish), "Are you like a dominatrix magnet or something?" since we had so many professional dominatrixes we would run into and who were eager to be interviewed. At least 5% of the people I approached randomly.I did this for three years and as I always tell people: I turned over every rock in NYC. There\'s nothing I didn\'t know about what goes on in NYC at three in the morning.I went to Riker\'s Island (a jail), I went to sex clubs, I went to late-night factories, I went to illegal radio stations, I pretended to be homeless for weeks at a time, I went to buildings with floor after floor of cubicles with naked women doing online sex charging by the second (and this was 1997).And often I would hear the saddest horror stories of what cast people out from the day into the night, probably never to return to normal lives again.I would release four interviews a week. In a sense, I was podcasting from January 1996 to January 1999. Four interviews released a week, chosen out of about 15 interviews a week. A little over 2000 interviews in all. 5% of that equals about 100 dominatrixes.And for 100% of them, I had to get my interviewees comfortable in 30 seconds or less. After 30 seconds they start throwing bottles at you. Or chasing you. Or even worse, just simply ignoring you.For my first few weeks of interviews, HBO made me bring a bodyguard. But when we were chased out of a transvestite club once he was at least three blocks ahead of me. He was a track star in college. Or in the FBI. Or some military unit he claimed.Then I would make my interviewees sign a release form. It wasn\'t required but I asked them to put their phone number on the release form. I will admit that on only three occasions I used the phone number later to ask a girl out on a date. After all, they were already comfortable talking to me. And that HBO jacket had to come in handy somehow.A podcast is different but also the same. The similarity is that they have to get comfortable with you. Sometimes its hard.Coolio told me the other day he thought I was obnoxious at first. But then he said at the end, "but you got me to reveal some real deep shit I wasn\'t planning on talking about. Kudos." That was like milk chocolate spilling into my brain.Here\'s what I do and what I DON\'T do.A) PREPARATION:This past week I did 4 podcasts. For the four podcasts I read 11 books. I read all the books written by each person I\'m interviewing. I highlight parts of each book and make comments on the highlights. I then write down in my notepad what question I might want to ask based on that highlight.Most of the time I highlight something because I learned something incredible from it, hence the very reason the person is on my podcast - because I wanted to learn from them and they are heroes of mine.In one case this week I had to track down a book released in the UK but not yet released until next month in the US.In another case, the person I was interviewing didn\'t have a book out but I read through all the articles he was involved in and the media strategy he had helped set up for his company.I also watch every interview the person has ever done.This is critical because I want to make sure I don\'t repeat any questions they are already bored of answering. The last thing I want is for them to think, "ugh, I can\'t believe he asked me that".I know from prior interviews I\'ve watched what questions they\'ve been asked and what questions they are totally sick of.Also by looking at prior interviews, I know the stuff they are just beginning to reveal and have never revealed before. This gives me ideas of where to explore further.B) GET THEM COMFORTABLEWhen I interviewed Peter Thiel, at first he was busy so I had to call back. When he got on the phone my first question was, "So what have you been up to today?" And that led to a fun conversation.Sometimes I say, "I\'ve been looking forward to this but first I have a beef to settle with you." And the "beef" is usually a story where we had briefly intersected and I make fun of it. With Jim Norton I had to remind him of what people thought of him the day he started fourth grade.Always the first line or two has to put them at ease.AN IMPORTANT POINTt: I\'m almost always recording before they realize I\'m recording. Often the best gems are when the "pressure of the interview" hasn\'t started yet.I don\'t do this to fool anyone. I tell them afterwards and they usually laugh. Because usually the casual talk is where we really begin to relate.C) SET EXPECTATIONSI usually tell people right in the beginning what I hope my listeners or readers will get out of the interview.I don\'t want to just promote someone\'s book or show. I want to learn something. I want my listeners to learn something. I want to laugh. And then...D) I WANT THE PERSON I INTERVIEW TO LEARN SOMETHINGI don\'t like an interview to beME: questionPERSON: Deep answerJust like I want to have conversations with my friends rather than interviews, I like the interviews on my podcast to be like conversations.An interview is like a guided tour through someone\'s life or a particular work they have recently done.A conversation is an exploration that two people have where hopefully they can meet somewhere in the middle and be curious about each other\'s answers. That\'s my ideal.Like anyone, the people I\'m interviewing have problems in their lives. I like to hear those problems and offer my two cents, whether they help or not. I want to make someone think without coming across as annoying.This is very difficult. But if I\'m listening close enough to what they are saying I can hear the small sorrows and successes that are in the spaces between words. That is often where the real interview takes place.E) CURIOSITYI hate when someone says something I don\'t understand. I don\'t hate them, I hate the feeling I get when I don\'t understand something.It\'s like this itch on my back that I can\'t quite reach.If I\'m curious about something, I\'ll ask. Some interviewees (Wayne Dyer) if you just hit "Go" he\'ll talk for an hour. But I get curious about almost everything he says.I want my life to be better so I need to understand everything. And if I think he\'s missing something or skipping something because he\'s speaking at level I don\'t understand, then I stop him until I understand.If you are afraid to be curious for fear of offending them or interrupting too much then there is no point in doing the interview.As an example, when Coolio mentioned he broke his cocaine habit, I was really curious. It\'s not easy to break a habit like that. So I had to interrupt him when he had already gone onto the next thought and say, "How did you break that habit?"F) DON\'T HAVE AN AGENDAI never argue with someone I\'m interviewing. I\'m not an investigative journalist. Nor do I really have any strong opinions about anything. But if I\'m not sure I agree, then I want to know why someone thinks the way they do. I want to learn something from it.There\'s always many sides to every story. Who am I to judge?If you turn away from the sun, you\'re in the dark. But the sun is still there, shining equally on everyone. In an interview we\'re all equally lit in the sun, no matter what thoughts go through our head or what experiences we\'ve had.The listeners are the sun. I can either show them light, or darkness. And they can\'t see if it\'s just darkness.G) ALWAYS BRING IT BACK DOWN TO THE LISTENERYou know who your audience is. The person you\'re interviewing either doesn\'t know or doesn\'t care. I don\'t say this in a critical way. Their business is their business and your business is your audience.Make sure when things go on a tangent, that some value is extracted for the audience. Pull it back.H) REPEAT AND SUMMARIZEEvery now and then take what has been said and try to summarize in verbal bullet points the value that has been expressed in a down-to-Earth useable fashion.This gives them an opportunity to either agree, expand on, or correct.I) ASK THEM SOMETHING THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN ASKED BEFOREI like it when someone I\'ve interviewed calls me later and says, "Friends are listening to this and saying they\'ve never seen this side of me."You have to dig in your preparation and listen during the interview to find a path that they have never been taken on before. On that path is the gold.J) WHAT DID YOU LEARN?Right after an interview is done, I almost completely forget it. So I always try to take notes or write down things right afterwards else I\'ll forget.If I do all of the nine other things above then I will definitely get value for myself out of the interview. Things I\'ve learned that can improve my life.An interview is never just audio, or video, or text. It\'s everything and you have to remember the critical points, the points that scream, "LEARN THIS!" that you can then repeat in every medium where you publish the interview.Many of these things are completely unexpected. From almost everyone I\'ve interviewed I learn something new that was not planned, either by me and in many cases by the interviewee. These are often the most valuable to share.---One time, way back when, I was interviewing a professional dominatrix for my 3am project. She said something I never forget. "People don\'t pay me for the things I do to them. People pay me so that when it\'s over I leave."Don\'t drag the interview out hoping for more gems than might exist there.When it\'s over, leave. Hopefully at the end you have a new friend and you\'ve learned many new things and have had a fun time and will make people laugh and give people value.The best interview is when all the equipment is off, you take a deep breath, and you realize that in the past hour your life just got a little bit better.'

S' I write for about five to ten hours a day. And another hour a day at least in pain trying to figure out what I\'m going to write about. I got thrown out of graduate school because I spent all my time writing novels that never got published. I failed five classes in a row and eventually they asked me to leave. Finally, 13 years after that, I got my first paycheck for writing something. I got a $200 check. I framed it. 13 years later, about a few months ago, I threw the check in the garbage. I don\'t like to feel sentimental over anything. I write about the past but I won\'t live in it anymore. I\'ve written 18 books. I\'ve written 1000s of articles. I probably write over 1 million words a year. One of my books has sold over 300,000 copies. My last book has sold about 50,000 copies. I have a book coming out on September 1. Here\'s what full time writers know. A) Writers don\'t make moneyI mention the $200 check above. That\'s not real money. I had two kids, rent, etc. You have to make more than that to pay the bills. Even when I sell 300,000 copies of a book. That\'s a 99 cent book. It\'s over years. It\' not a real salary and it can\'t be relied on for the next book unless you are JD Salinger. B) Writers find alternative sources of income: Speaking, consulting, using your growing platform to launch a company, creating a newsletter, perhaps going on television, building a company with other writers (like a publishing company), and so on. Art is when you take when you see in the world and translate it through the prism of your experience. If all you do is write, then the prism gets too weak to make art. C) First you typewrite, then you write. Get the first draft done no matter what. Then the real work begins. Take out the first paragraph. Take out the last. Take out every other word. Sculpt the ugly mass of clay you are left with. People say this is rewriting. I prefer to think of this as sculpting. Too many people agonize paragraph by paragraph. Rush to the finish line. Then go back and walk over every step you made and see what you can do better. This is the real gift you give your reader. D) You can\'t waste more than six seconds of someone\'s time. Every six seconds people feel the urge to turn away. Looking at tiny lines on a screen or a page is not natural. So every six seconds (every sentence), you have to give someone a new hook. E) Most books should be chapters, most chapters should be paragraphs. A book is really a chapter that has been artificially expanded to look like a book. Don\'t fall for that trap. Fill in as much information as possible in each paragraph. Don\'t think your audience is stupid. F) 17 Years. This is how long it takes to be a good writer. You can be a decent writer before then. You can be a paid writer before then. But every writer I\'ve ever interviewed (and I\'ve interviewed many on my podcast and elsewhere) always seem to come down to that number. Kurt Vonnegut is a classic example. Started writing in 1945 when he returned from the war. Didn\'t really have financial success with writing until about 1970 and in 1968 all of his books were out of print. So he kept going. Persistence, even more than rewriting, separates out the good writers from the bad writers. G) Don\'t Write from a Pedestal. Writers know that the world is a joke and nobody knows anything. When you write like you know something, like you\'re an expert, then you are making a fool of yourself. Many writers kill themselves because they\'ve run out of things to joke about. They\'ve run out of enough life to turn into insanity. Put yourself in the writing. Don\'t say "10 things to make life better". Say, "10 things I had to do to make life better or I would die." H) In good writing, people have no skills. Remember the character in the movie who walks in a room and instantly hits the guy who is about to slash him from behind? That guy doesn\'t exist in the real world. In the real world, we don\'t have skills. Nobody does. Remove your skills. In good writing, remove people\'s ability to deal with the world around them. Life is hard. The universe has been around 14 billion years and we\'ve only been around 10-90. Don\'t think you can fight the tidal wave of atoms that swarm over our destinies. Constantly remove skills from everyone to make your writing better. I) Reading is magicWhen you read a book, you get the entire curated life of another person. So the more you read, the more lives you absorb. This gives you more experiences to write about. Reading is critical to writing well. Read non-fiction for ideas. Read quality fiction to get better at writing. J) There are no answers, only questions. Writers ask questions. A writer who provides an answer is not a writer but a preacher. The world is filled with mysteries. Writers point them out, flounder around inside of them, and ultimately leave with more mystery. ---All of this is BS. See the world with your own unique eyes, your own unique failures, your own unique you. Tell us about it.'

S' The earliest known religion has been found in the galaxy: z8_GND_5296. Look it up. Massive telescopes in New Mexico have found the evidence but I happen to know a bit more. Here\'s the truth: Apparently the Universe is very stupid. ("uni" "verse" - one story). For a brief moment on this galaxy there was consciousness. Some single-celled bacteria woke up for pico-second and realized it was alive. Once anything is alive, it wants to know "Why". Since this amoeba-like creature was created in the image of the universe it has all of the other qualities of the universe. - It eventually died. Just like the universe will. - It\'s constantly expanding into more and more chaos, just like everything in the universe is. - It wants to explore. - It knows there are no answers, only questions. - When it turns on the TV there is static between the stations. The goal of the universe if to get rid of the static. The amoeba died but the Universe, up until then the only conscious being in existence, came up with a plan. It realized it didn\'t know many things. So It came up with an idea. What if I splinter off pieces of myself, send it out to other galaxies and worlds and time zones and so on and give it eyes and ears and other senses. Then they would live, die, expand, create chaos, teach each other, betray each other, lie to each other, and against all odds, try to find hope in each other. Then when the piece of the Universe dies, as all things do, it will come back into the Universe, and the Universe will absorb all of the information, learning a tiny bit more about itself. This is the only religion. Everyone thinks they are a fully actualized individual being but that\'s just a fake. We inherit our personalities from nature and nurture using the machinery the Universe has provided us. We then look at things with the eyes and listen with ears and we try to argue our opinions with the disgusting bacteria-filled hole in the middle of our faces. We shit almost every day. We grunt and sweat when we create new versions of ourselves. All of this is purely for the info-tainment of the Universe. Who records dutifully and then we get tucked back into the Universal fold when we die with no other memory other than the massive Universal memory of all things that ever lived and died. There is no right or wrong. There is only learning. There is no order. There is only ever-expanding chaos. There is no karma. We are temporarily conscious tape recorders and then the tape is stored in data banks for later use. I like my mission. I like spending my days learning on behalf of the larger consciousness that I am not only a part of, but it is a part of me - since there is no difference. Only our ego thinks there is a difference, but that is part of the learning. Whether good things or bad things happen to the creature that think it is "me", I don\'t care. It\'s all information that benefits the Universe, which is always happy because it\'s only as old as a little child. You might think this is crazy. But it\'s true. How do I know? Because it\'s wonderful.'

S' I met a girl in a bar. Which is the first and only time I had ever done that. She said, "try this". It was a drink. I tried it. We ordered two more. Then two more. Then two more. then two more .I went to the urine-stenched bathroom. I came back. She was kissing another guy. I was dizzy. I was blurry. I said, "hey!" She said, "he was just being friendly". Two more. The bartender was laughing at my jokes. He googled me and gave me free drinks. Two more. He said he would buy my book. He watched a video of me. What were we drinking? Something something. The bathroom at that point was in a telephone booth. I think I went there. We were out in the street. It was raining. It was three in the morning. She was laughing. I fell in the middle of the street. Lexington and 50th. Cars were coming. My face wet against the ground. I think I fell asleep. She fell also, on top of me. Laughing. Cars honked and swerved around us. We crawled to the corner. I don\'t think any cars hit us but if they had then maybe I\'m dead and this is just another universe I\'m answering this in. We made it to my hotel room. I forgot my room number. I forgot how to use the key. I forgot I was with the girl. I went to my room and she collapsed in the living room. I fell asleep. About an hour later I woke up and was feeling sick. I ran into the bathroom and along the way I projectile vomited along the walls, the bed, the bathroom, the floor. When I was finished I fell asleep back down on the bed, which had my vomit. A few hours later I had to wake up. I got dressed. I put on a tie. I saw the girl in the living room. She was a little out of focus for my eyes. She was half on the couch and her legs were on the floor. Her mouth was open. She was snoring. I left. I walked a few blocks. I found myself in an office on Fifth Avenue. I was late. Everyone was in a boardroom looking at me. "Sorry I\'m late," I said. "Sorry," my stomach said to me. I was feeling sick. Like I would throw up again. And then I explained to everyone in the room why they should give me money for my new business.'

S' How do I stop loving a girl who doesnt love me, someone asked me.I didnt answer him correctly. I gave some BS answer. The correct answer is: theres nothing you can do. Youre in pain. Youre wounded. Time heals all wounds.For me, I fall in love very quickly so my only solution is to fall in love again, whatever that means  usually obsession and addiction and disappointment like someone sitting on your lungs and not letting you breathe until just a single breath is all you ask for.In other words, I make every mistake possible.But I did give some response a la Sting about setting them free and he replied and said, but shouldnt love REQUIRE that the person I love make me happy?What!?Requirements are bad. I require that the world give me a lot of money, that the world make my kids put their phones away at dinner, that whoever I am with loves me forever, without doubts. I require that people who have long ago stopped talking to me just relax and start talking to me again. Requirements are for people who want to be unhappy. Because its your rules or the universes rules. The universe is going to win. Every time.And yetIm sorry Im about to do the list. I dont really like it when people tell me the list of things they KNOW.Because nobody really knows anything. The laws of physics change every few years. And now kale and juicing will supposedly rot your insides. Nobody knows anything about health, sex, love, atoms, and biology. Nobody knows anything about economics and finance.Were all monkeys that have been given typewriters by some extradimensional alien race and the joke is on us.If you want to add, please do so in the comments.I say this because I need to learn. I want to learn. I want to be a loving person and know how to treat people right and thats very hard to do.Ive often treated people wrong. You cant love until you forgive yourselfbut you have to remember.Whenever you think you know something, leave an empty box open inside your head so other people can put new things in there.Love is:Love is when you have no demands on the other person. Not even to make you happy.Love is when you care what they do, but dont worry about what they are doing.Love is when they say or do something insignificant and you feel, SURPRISE!Love is when you miss them, but dont require them.Love is when they are right all the time, even when they are wrong. You might be wrong. Who knows?Love is when you love the other people who love them.Love is when you see who they are. Not when you see who you want them to be.Love is when youre afraid to lose them, but you dont try and keep them.When theres drama, Love is when you both wrote the script together.Love is when they are upset and tell you and you count to two before you respond, Youre right.You love them when you keep yourself clean and you sleep well and eat well.Love is when you forgot to tell them something all the time.Love is when you cant sleep and are feeling sick and anxious and its 3am, but you reach out and touch them and now you are feeling a little better.SURPRISE!Love is when they are sick and theres nothing you can do so you listen to them.Love is when they want to do something and you dont, so you dont and everyone feels good about it.Love is when you just think laugh, and they start to laugh.You love them when you can still love yourself.This isnt a list of what you SHOULD do when you are in love. If you feel should then you might not be in love.These are things I feel when Im in love. Love comes and goes. And comes and goes. Its ok to not be in love. And its okay to be in love forever.Im married just a few years. And Im divorced before that. So I know nothing.If you become unhappy, then maybe the love was just a passing love. Dont fall into the trap of love when it is just want. You learned from each other and now can move on.Thank god you met. And now thank god you can leave each other at the right moment.Thats a love that lasts forever.'

S' The other day I asked an old friend of mine, "Why did everyone hate me at that job?"He said, "everyone thought you were an arrogant jerk." Then they fired me. I had forgotten how to communicate. I had forgotten the basic premise that allowed for the survival of our species. The ability to communicate far better than any other species. RIght now there is writing, instagramming, tweeting, status updates, youtube videos, quora answers, podcasting, and basic one-one communication. We have to learn the basic tenets of communication so that in this world where we receive up to 20,000 messages a day in all of it\'s varieties, our communications can rise to the top. Our message can be heard. Our MEANING can have an impact. Here\'s what I do now to help myself communicate better. A) IT\'S NOT ABOUT MEI\'m one person out of seven billion. There are so many problems on the Earth: war, poverty, sickness. There are also many ways to solve these problems. There\'s innovation every day. There are cures invented every day. There\'s people who want to help and have the resources. The pain in the world is caused by the gap between the problems and the solutions: corruption, bad education, fear. Having "Meaning" in life is when you can stake out your own small little way to close that gap. That is the gift your existence brings to history. When I made a lot of money, I forgot to create Meaning in my life. This left me with no "next step" in my life. Nothing worth saying to anybody. Having a vision had helped me make the money. But suddenly I no longer had any vision. So I went straight down. I forgot to ask at the end of every night, "Who did I help today?" B) LISTENListening is the underpinnings of communicating. You can\'t solve a person\'s problems by giving them money (although that sometimes is a solution). We are all constantly trying to tell our story. We wear masks, put on appearances, dance the dance. The gap occurs when the story we tell is different from the story we are trying to tell. The story of who we are inside. The one who listens is the one who can figure out that story. This is the first step at communicating to that baby child inside that wants to come out and play. C) QUESTIONSWithout the right question, you\'ll never get the right answer. We\'re not really smart enough to come up with the right answers. But if we listen carefully, we can ask the right questions. One question leads to another. 1000 questions might lead to one answer. One solution. I\'ve done 100s of interviews. A bad interview is when you have pre-canned questions and you already know the answers. A good interview is driven by curiosity. Dig a little deep. Get someone to take off the masks a little but so you can see who they really are. People love people who ASK them. People don\'t like people who TELL them.D) STORIESWhen my daughters were real little they wouldn\'t go to sleep until I told them a story about when I was a kid. I had to tell them a new story every day. They didn\'t want a lecture on why you shouldn\'t steal. They wanted to know about the time I stole and got caught. Between you and me there is a vast river. A story is a boat. An idea is a passenger on that boat. Only when you put the idea in the boat and send it in the right direction, when the wind is blowing just so, and the weather is the right temperature, does it have a chance of reaching the other side. At reaching you. E) LAUGHTERLaughter is before language. It\'s primal communication. If there was a rustling in the bush: could it be a lion? Or is it just the wind?Once a mammal discovered it was just the wind, an instinctive laugh would come out, informing the other members of it\'s tribe that there is nothing to worry about. Danger transforming into relief is communicated via laughter. This is true for at least the last 2 million years. Everyone is in danger constantly. How many people around the world woke up at three in the morning today, scared of something that will probably never happen. I know I did. Getting people to laugh tells people the danger is ok. You\'re safe here. In this spot, right now. With me. F) VULNERABILITYI used to go on a lot of news TV shows. I\'d be on these panels and they\'d tell us when to argue with each other. I\'d be sitting in a dark room in the studio with a camera facing me and an earpiece in my ear and ever now and then a voice would say, "Ok, argue now!" And we all had to be perfect. Nobody was allowed to say, "I don\'t know". I was always so scared because I never knew. But I foolishly felt like being on TV was a good thing. So, like everyone else (although that\'s not an excuse), I\'d pretend to know. And then we\'d all go home. Great job! But when I took a shower I felt like I could never get clean. So many things I got wrong. So many times I tried to be perfect and couldn\'t handle it unless I was perfect. To the point that perfectionism almost led to a very imperfect suicide. Deep down, we\'re all trying to figure this out. Why are we here? Why did this happen to me? How can I do better? When we admit it, share it, question it - we can communicate with that primal emptiness inside of everyone that just needs to be heard. It\'s in those moments of vulnerability that we become the best communicators. G) SILENCEHow can silence be a way to communicate? We all think about 60,000 thoughts a day. The only problem is: 95% of those thoughts are the same thoughts as yesterday. Silencing some of those thoughts would result in less stress, less anxiety, fear, regret. We speak about 10,000 words a day. What if we spoke one half of that? Whenever I write a book I try to go on a silent retreat. Not to get rid of distractions. To get rid of me! When you speak, you spill your energy everywhere. It disperses into the sky. Into nothingness. Here\'s a good trick to try: When someone is talking to you, if you are already thinking of a response while they are still talking, then you aren\'t listening. Let them finish. They have something to say to you. ----There\'s other skills of course: sales, languages, building things...I don\'t know. I\'m not really good at most things that people consider valuable skills. I\'m shy and like to sit in my room and I\'m afraid to meet new people. But I force myself to because I think, "this will take me out of my comfort zone." And then I will have something new to say. Then I can maybe help someone. Then I will have an answer to the only question that is ever important. At the end of the night, when the lights are out, when there\'s nothing left to say or do or think, to just wonder, even if there is no answer: "Who did I help today?"'

S" Thank you for asking me to answer this question Vishwathika. I also have to mention two other people who requested me to answer this. Thank you. As agreed, I am not tagging you! I do not consider myself highly anything. But well yes, I do think I am above average. I was also battling whether I should really be answering this but then decided to take a stab anyway. I decided because I realized that we are not encouraged to embrace our physical beauty (At least in my case). Somehow we are taught to be ashamed of it. There is a lot of social pressure. Well, I am breaking it and answering this question! In my country, I am considered attractive for two reasons - Firstly because I have fair skin (by Indian standards of course). Sadly, that is the definition of beauty for most Indians. Secondly, because I have symmetrical features. That seems to be something most people in the world term attractive and I too find myself attracted to men with symmetrical features. Other than that, there isn't anything much. I have to also say that I am not at all photogenic. In fact, in every photo of mine, I look extremely different. Here is a photo - With intellect, I have been taking efforts for long. Since childhood. Books have been my best friends and I have had intellectual pursuits all my life. Although I never aced exams, I was excellent with knowledge. In college and later, people have been coming up to me with questions and I have had a very satisfying journey as a teacher of law. There are perks as well as flip sides. Perks of being attractive - People notice you. People assist you. Very rarely people forget me. More so if they speak with me. People (men) have readily helped me out when I have had any issue. That is probably a perk of being a young girl too. I can't be sure. But I have experienced men readily helping me out when I was in distress than say a young boy. The world is quite unfair in the sense that it is simply nicer to good looking people. I have been very conscious of never taking undue advantage of this fact. Other than that, I don't see anything much. Flip side of being attractive -Since she is good looking, obviously she won't have brain - Many times, the biggest misconception a lot of people have when they first meet me is this. I encountered that sentiment the most when I was practicing in courts. For some reason, people presumed I wouldn't be intelligent and didn't shy away from showing surprise when I argued and kicked their ass in court! One incident is very distinct in my mind. I was arguing against a very senior advocate. It was a simple argument of maintenance for my client. Since it was a very small argument, I was asked to argue. This was just 2 years back. I looked tiny in front of the senior advocate. He looked complacent ( as many senior advocates do!). After I finished my argument the judge told me 'well argued'. (She also later passed an order in my favour!) As I left and came out of the court room, the advocate followed. He told me he never expected me to argue so well. I politely just asked him why! He was a tad bit uncomfortable at my question and quickly mumbled that generally girls as young as I, didn't. I just smiled. He told me he would be happy to buy me a cup of tea since I argued so well. You never refuse a senior advocate. So, I agreed. This is just one of those countless encounters I have had where people naturally presumed that I wouldn't be intelligent. There is also the general belief that beautiful people get away with sloppy work. Because of this, I have encountered people presuming that just because I looked nice, I would be sloppy with my work. Well, I have been happy to prove them wrong. HarassmentI have been molested and have encountered many incidents where I was groped at and harassed. This isn't uncommon. Because I was a fair and beautiful child, I was molested even as a child and that was quite traumatic. It took me years to be OK with my body. It took me years to be OK with my physical beauty. Somehow I had associated it with being harassed. I had internalized the blame and took no efforts to look nice. In fact I deliberately dressed down. My teens were gone in wearing baggy jeans and dirty T's. Mainly because I thought if I looked beautiful, I would somehow attract the same kind of behaviour and harassment. Perks of being intelligent - The perks of being intelligent are plenty. I identify as an intellectual and can practically teach myself to do many things on my own. I studied law and have been teaching it for the past 4 years since I was 22 years of age. I speak 4 languages and learnt French in just under 2 years. I am a decent singer and can appreciate and process music in myriad languages spreading across varied genres. I taught myself body massage. I also have a degree in Yoga. I dance well and enjoy playing chess. I aced debate and moot court competitions in college and am regularly called as a judge now!I am a voracious reader and decent writer. I am quick at grasping things. And I usually process things well. I am also a gifted and trained speaker. I enjoy deep and intellectually stimulating conversations where there is exchange of ideas. I am good with intellectual work. I am liked for it too. I am great with advice. (Not so good at taking my own. But well!) Problem solving. I can easily process issues and break them down into pieces. Most people come to me in trouble and I feel happy to help them. Whether its legal advice or general. I have been able to help many people and to this day enjoy doing it.I see the deeper reasons. I see the meaning behind words that most often the speaker herself isn't able to express. I am also great at analyzing myself or others. Flip side - The flip side of intelligence is over analysis of things. I am a classic case of 'absent minded' prof! So, even when I do consider myself intelligent, I don't think I am very smart. I am also a scatter brain and I tend to get bored quickly if there is no intellectual stimulation. The biggest problem with this is when I have to do mundane tasks. I suck at it. Also, being intelligent becomes quite lonely. I have very little patience for banal chit chat and most often in a huge group, I withdraw simply because my talk is deemed unnecessarily 'too intellectual for mortals'. There is also the problem that a lot of men feel intimidated by my intelligence. I never intend to but I somehow make them feel insecure. They are more likely to like me (or accept me) for my beauty than my intellect. (This has been my experience so far. I don't in any way wish to generalize. In fact I genuinely hope to meet more men interested in my intellect than I have). My kind of intelligence has the curse of being too mature for my age. I am just 26 years old but I swear I mentally can relate to people in their 40s. I am not very sure, but this is probably the reason why I am always attracted to older men! Boys my age are well, boys. How does it feel? I have learnt to be OK with my physical beauty. Thank it and be OK with men getting attracted because of that. As I grow in my life's journey, I accept and understand that physical attraction plays a major role in humans connecting and it is a good thing. I have also learnt to take compliments gracefully. Even though I did suffer some traumatic incidents, I'd rather have this privilege than not have it. Being intelligent feels great. I feel like I am in my element. I enjoy the pursuits of mind and I truly am grateful to be blessed with it. I have also been blessed to have innumerable talents and have decided to make the most of it. It feels great! This whole answer is written in relative context. I look up to far superior brains than mine. I hope, desire and persevere to reach there. Looks, I couldn't care much and am very happy with what I have. For more of my answers and posts, follow my blog - Mindful musings"

S' Whistleblower Protection Act is a toothless legislation. The law was passed following a lot of activism. The Law Commission of India in 2001 had drafted a Bill on this issue . In 2004, in response to a petition filed after the infamous murder of Satyendra Dubey, the Supreme Court directed that machinery be put in place for acting on complaints from whistleblowers till a law is enacted. The government notified a resolution in 2004 that gave the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) the power to act on complaints from whistleblowers. Till the enactment of the law, the CVC was receiving and acting upon complaints. The law received President\'s sanction in May 2014. Following is why I say it is a toothless legislation - 1.  No definition of \'Victimization\' - The law doesnt define \'victimization\'. In once instance, it indirectly limits it to victimised by initiation of any proceedings or otherwise. {Refer Section 11(1)}The definition of \'victimization\' ought to be very wide.2. Limited definition of \'Disclosure\' - {Refer section 3 (d)}The Act defines disclosure thus "disclosure" means a complaint relating to,(i) an attempt to commit or commission of an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988; (ii) wilful misuse of power or wilful misuse of discretion by virtue of which demonstrable loss is caused to the Government or demonstrable wrongful gain accrues to the public servant or to any third party; (iii) attempt to commit or commission of a criminal offence by a public servant, made in writing or by electronic mail or electronic mail message, against the public servant and includes public interest disclosure referred to in sub-section (2) of section 4. This definition is quite restrictive in nature. The definition of disclosure ought to be very expansive in nature and not limited to misuse of power or corruption. 3. Disclosure of the identity of the whistleblower / No provision for anonymous whistleblowing - (Refer Section 4)The law mandates the identity of the whistleblower be disclosed in the disclosure without which no action shall be taken by the competent Authority. The competent authority then shall conceal the identity of the whistleblower. The Competent Authority may, with the prior written consent of the complainant, reveal the identity of the complainant to such office or organization where it becomes necessary to do so. If the complainant does not agree to his name being revealed, in that case, the complainant shall provide all documentary evidence in support of is complaint to the Competent Authority. 4. Powers of Competent Authority are limited to making recommendations - (Refer section 7)After receipt of the report or comments relating to the complaint, if the Competent Authority is of the opinion that such comments or report reveals either wilful misuse of power or wilful misuse of discretion or substantiates allegations of corruption, it shall recommend to the public authority to take appropriate corrective measures such as initiating proceedings against the concerned public servant or other administrative and corrective steps. However, in case the public authority does not agree with the recommendation of the Competent Authority, it shall record the reasons for such disagreement.The powers are thus limited to making recommendations. It has no other powers to impose penalty. 5. No penalties on officials who victimize whistleblowers.There are penalties imposed only on officials who negligently or mala fidely reveal the identity of the whistleblower. 6. Courts not having jurisdiction to take a suo-moto action / or to take cognizance- (Refer Section 21 & 22)Lastly, no court has the jurisdiction to in respect of any matter which the Competent Authority is empowered by or under this Act to determine and no injunction can be granted by any court or other authority in respect of any action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any power conferred by or under this Act. No court can take cognizance of any offence punishable under this Act or the rules or regulations made thereunder, save on a complaint made by the Competent Authority or any officer or person authorised by it. Read the full text of the law here - Page on persmin.gov.in India has witnessed the brutal murders of bravehearts who stood against corruption and paid the price with their lives. Satyendra Dubey and Manjunath Shanmugam are 2 such bravehearts in whose memory I write this post. The passing of a stringent law may not end corruption, but it will certainly bring the light of justice for countless such lives who are gone. It will also act as a deterrent.For more on Indian laws, follow my blog - Blawgniti'

We are truly open minded and we can have a really satisfying conversation / debate. Next time you debate, just remind yourself this - You are listening to understand another perspective.

S' Thank you so much for asking me to answer. It was a great experience! Firstly, I have to say that the organizers as well as the students were very warm and welcoming. It felt great to be connected to so many people with common interests and an open and curious mind. Nagpur is a quiet city in the North of Maharashtra. I had visited it once before for a moot court competition in college a few years back. I was happy to be back there. The stay arrangement was excellent and so were the hosts. :) The whole experience of the meetup was superb! Chaitanya was a great anchor. Although he was a tad bit nervous at the beginning he had no reason to be so! Barsha, other organizers and volunteers were extremely enthusiastic and warm. To be honest, I had no idea Quora was so popular! Or that so many people knew me! I was surprised to see more than 500 (I am told the number was a whopping 550+) students in the audience!! I was also happy to answer their interesting questions! Ranging from law, to psychology, to politics, to sociology, to current affairs, start-ups, Yoga, Game of thrones, women in India, we discussed plethora of issues! There were puns, jokes, interesting insights and a lot of warmth and happiness shared. I was also happy again to connect to Niharika and Ankush whom I had met before in the IIT Bombay event. Meeting Aishwarya was amazing. I had been reading some of her answers and knew about her through Quora before. True to her image, Niharika is intelligent, interactive, energetic and easy to talk to. Ankush is witty, funny and a very nice person. The three of us girls had a nice time teasing him. :) Aishwarya, is unlike her image. Totally. An extremely funny person, she quickly becomes the life of the group! Given that we were staying in the same hotel, we chatted well past midnight! It was great talking to her and like I told her, I never felt like we were conversing for the first time! This meetup will forever be cherished! Warm and wonderful memories... :) Thank you again, AXIS team for inviting me. Here is a click with the awesome audience and organizers of the meet. The next day I was asked to judge Model United Nations conference organized by VNIT. The resolution was regarding the Global Refugee crisis. It was an amazing experience to judge school students who had participated! I was a tad bit worried because I am used to judging (and grilling) college students (mainly law) in competitions. I am also known as quite a scary judge. (This apparently is the reason why I am invited I am told! LOL) But I was taken aback by how prepared and well versed the school students were. All in all, an awesome experience I will always cherish. :)'

If he isn't happy with me, nor am I going to be. And while his leaving may make me sad, I'll move on too. So if he decides to walk away, I'd accept it. Honour his wish.

S" I have had quite a funny relationship with my beauty for long. Today, I embrace it. I thank it. And I also accept and allow myself to feel beautiful and be appreciated for my beauty. Before I actually go to my answer, let me make it clear that I wouldn't go to define beauty. Each may have her own definition and I have no right to go tell someone to define beauty according to my ideology. I may think beauty is internal while someone else may think it's about the skin tone. As long as no rights are violated based on that, I don't see a problem with definitions. Neither is superior or inferior to the other. End of the day they are all definitions and they are all beliefs. Every belief is true for the believer. For the purpose of this answer, I am referring to physical beauty when I use the word 'beauty'. I started out hating my physical beauty owing to some traumatic incidents in my childhood. Growing up, for long, I perceived a conflict between beauty and intelligence. Like you could only have one of the two. If someone complimented me for my beauty I would snap at them to say that I'd rather be known for my intellect. It took some time but I realized both were biological accidents. Beauty as well as brains. And considering one as superior to the other was stupid. What was truly my own were my efforts. Whether they were towards my mind or body didn't matter. Having been raised by parents who encouraged the pursuits of the mind much more than the body, I obviously ended up loving my mind more. Books were my food and intellectual pursuits my life's biggest pleasures. I didn't allow myself to feel beautiful because that didn't matter. It was only recently that I opened my mind to the possibility that being beautiful was a good thing. A gift! Today I try to take equal care of my mind and body. Though I will always be partial to my mind and its pursuits, I do not look down on the pursuits of the body. I feel that I kind of won a genetic lottery. I am beautiful as well as intelligent. I have many varied talents. And I should be thankful. I should make the most of it all and enjoy it. Lastly, I understood that I enjoy being appreciated for my beauty though I'd hate to be limited to it. When men compliment me for my physical beauty I easily find myself blushing (most often if I like them), or thank them. They saw something nice in me, and that's good. I don't judge them as superficial. I consider it very natural for all of us to appreciate human beauty. My beauty is a part of my personality. I embrace it. I have decided to enjoy it while it lasts. ( Applies equally to both beauty and mind) :)For more of my ideas and thoughts on life, psychology and philosophy, follow my blog - Mindful musings"

S" Parents are the first figures of authority in a child's life. Nearly all of the mental foundation of a human is formed in childhood. (Despite this, I strongly believe that nothing possibly short of taking another human's life is irreparable. You can mend anything within yourself when you decide to). Since relationship with parents is the first relationship any child experiences, most times, all our relationships later in life tend to mimic the first two. Either they are the same, or just the opposite. In any case, if you see closely enough, you will find a pattern. If all the child sees is disrespect and violence, he / she will either do the same or live in fear. Either of the two.Do not raise a child when there is mutual disrespect, violence and disharmony. While separation of parents isn't fun for any child, between living with parents who bicker constantly and separated parents, I'd say separation is better. If you are mature about the separation, if you do not treat the child like a possession and ensure that he / she knows that despite your separation the child will always be loved and taken care of by both, children understand. If not then, after growing up a little they understand. They also understand that sometimes two adults cannot be happy together. In such a situation, it is better to gracefully let go rather than be miserable together. And that despite the parents separation, the child can still be loved and taken care of by both.For more of my answers, follow my blog - Mindful musings"

S" In India - Fatwas are not necessarily death threats. The ones that become famous of course are about death threats. But there are lots of other harmless ones. Ridiculous though most of them nevertheless are. Fatwas are where religious opinion is asked and the religious scholar responds. There are some Fatwas which are issued suo moto too. As far as the legality of such fatwas is concerned, they are the same as the rubbish that goes on in Nirmal Baba's sabha. Not legally enforceable but you cannot do anything if one fool asks the other what should be the length of his beard according to Islam and decides to follow the Fatwa, or believes that it is sanctioned by his god. Legally, they are not valid. The Supreme Court in the landmark judgment of Vishwa Lochan Madan V. Union of India (1) , dealt with the issue of legality of Fatwas in India. This issue was raised after the harrowing tale of Imrana, a woman from Uttar Pradesh who was raped by her father-in-law. The question arose about her marital status and those of her children born in the wedlock with rapists son. The Fatwa of Dar-ul-Uloom in this connection reads as follows:If one raped his sons wife and it is proved through witnesses, or the rapist himself confesses it, Haram Musaharat will be proved. It means that the wife of the son will become unlawful forever to him i.e. the son. The woman with whom father has copulated legally or had sexual intercourse illegally in both ways, the son cant keep physical relationship with her. The Holy Quran says: Marry not the woman whom your father copulated The Fatwa dissolved the marriage and passed a decree for perpetual injunction restraining the husband and wife living together, though none of them ever approached the Darul Uloom. There are endless stupid questions asked and answered daily. Here, check out - What should be the length of a Muslim person's beard?...What you be the height of his pajama? Is it Ok if it extends the ankle?... During the fasting, is applying hair oil allowed as the scalp ends up soaking some?... Can women wear jeans? Can they wear a 'bindi'?Can a woman wax her legs and underarms?...Is artificial insemination allowed?... (Like this was knows back then!)A brilliant example where the seeker asked a question about aborting (as advised by the doctor in the interest of the woman and child) in 8-9th week, where the 'scholar' misconceived that as 8th month in pregnancy. I hope as hell the reader realized this and heeded the doctor. I want to know that my real uncle (Chacha) has expired so that my aunty is now in iddah so I want to know that who can talk with her or meet with her and can she walk on the roof?  Now days in the market too many hair removable blade (RAZOR) available. Is it allow in Islam women can use to remove hair (pubic or else) or only hair removal cream is allow? please give answer in the light of Quran & Hadith Answer - A woman also can shave her pubic hair from razor; but since softness of the pubic area is desirable in women therefore it is better for them to use hair remover creams.I have quoted everything from the website of Darul-Ifta. (2) The biggest and most prestigious school to whom people write for resolving of their religious queries is 'Darul Uloom Deoband' in Uttar Pradesh. Darul Ifta is one of its departments. There are plethora of Fatwas issued by them and the content of most of them would make any rational person both laugh and after a point maybe cry at the idiocy involved. Please note that every question / example I have quoted here is asked and referred to on the website. There is an excellent book by Aroun Shourie called 'The world of Fatwas' where he has quoted all of these in their hard copies with indices and volume numbers. Give it a read, it is excellent. I always had this question as to who follows this and asks. I mean sure, a small percentage of adherents in all faiths were bound to be stupid. And hence, I had always ignored the issue. Until of course I read the stats. Until of course I realized that no Muslim is willing to challenge the legality of this hogwash. Personally, I have a huge problem with the fact that fatwas are considered as binding by many blind adherents of the faith. People from around the globe write to these enlightened scholars who then spend man-hours discussing clothes and beard. What's more, the most outrageous thing is that these religious nuts who start their idiocy as 'arbiters' and 'counselors' often end up starting a parallel judicial system which if their population increases, will pose a direct threat to a justice system which is based on rule of law. Many Muslim countries already have this problem. Countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan have Religious courts (presided over by the Taliban of course) dispensing justice posing a threat to their judicial system. Muslim in many European countries also insist on having these parallel judicial system which threatens sane laws. (3) Muslim Arbitral tribunals are now getting set up in most European countries. In most countries they are not allowed but the struggle continues. If they are allowed, their operations are very strictly limited like the UK. In India, a scam was unearthed where it was found that the scholars can be bought and a fatwa of your choice can be secured. No surprises there. (4) The Supreme Court of India in Vishwa Lochan Madan's case (1), used the following words - As observed earlier, the Fatwa has no legal status in our Constitutional scheme.Notwithstanding that it is an admitted position that Fatwas have been issued and are being issued. All India Muslim Personal Law Board feels the necessity of establishment of a network of judicial system throughout the country and Muslims should be made aware that they should get their disputes decided by the Quazis. According to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board this establishment may not have the police powers but shall have the book of Allah in hand and sunnat of the Rasool and all decisions should be according to the Book and the Sunnat. This will bring the Muslims to the Muslim Courts. They will get justiceHowever, as the Fatwa gets strength from the religion; it causes serious psychological impact on the person intending not to abide by that. Having regard to the fact that a Fatwa has the potential of causing immense devastation, we feel impelled to add a word of caution. We would like to advise the Dar-ul-Qaza or for that matter anybody not to give any response or issue Fatwa concerning an individual, unless asked for by the person involved or the person having direct interest in the matter. It shall be in violation of basic human rights. It cannot be used to punish innocent. No religion including Islam punishes the innocent. Religion cannot be allowed to be merciless to the victim. Faith cannot be used as dehumanising force.Lastly, nobody in a democracy can prevent people from seeking answers to such questions or for giving them. People can follow what they like. They can't impose the same on others. So, per se, fatwas are not illegal. But they are not enforceable either.

S" There are two things. I'll start with - Free Will - That 'I' am doing something in all this! The universe constantly tells me that I am NOT in charge. Nothing is in my hands. Any minute anything can happen. As I write this answer, I can die of a cardiac arrest.I mean, literally anything can happen. In fact my personal life has enough evidence that I am not in charge. I still try very hard to be in charge and convince myself that I am! Because if I stop believing that 'I' matter and am in charge, I won't survive anyway. So, this belief is imperative for my survival. I can be wrong - At the base of every belief I have is skepticism. I have read, got convinced, argued, tried to convince others of many theories, some of them my very own! But I have also been very open to change. To some people around me, that's shifting loyalty. To me, that's evolving! And of course the universe has given me plenty of examples that most often the simplest conclusions, or my first impressions were right. So, I may not be wrong all the time! Here's a question - My belief that I can be wrong when the universe tells me otherwise actually makes me right or wrong? There you go, I just gave you a taste of what goes on inside my mind! Stupid mental loops which have absolutely no practical use but which are fully capable of driving me nuts!A note on the word 'Staunchly' - I am not staunch about anything as is clear from my point number two.

S" I agree with Harshal. The answer to this question is, you can't. I have always felt music was born when man desired to express something which couldn't be expressed in words. Sound has a deep impact on humans. We tend to be naturally musical. Language and music are deeply connected too. There has always been a debate as to whether the two developed together or independently. Rousseau (a writer as well as a musician) opined that both music and language emerged together, as a singsong speech. They possible diverged later.Steven Pinker, in 'The language instinct, says - What benefit could there be to diverting time and energy to making plinking noises? . . . As far as biological cause and effect are concerned, music is useless....It could vanish from our species and the rest of our lifestyle would be virtually unchanged.Regardless of whether or not it serves a biological or evolutionary purpose, music has been there for centuries and will never cease to exist. There is something profoundly emotional about music. I feel it touches those parts of our subconscious that are not accessible otherwise. The stimulation clearly is very pleasurable. The inexpressible depth of music, Schopenhauer writes, so easy to understand and yet so inexplicable, is due to the fact that it reproduces all the emotions of our innermost being, but entirely without reality and remote from its pain.... Music expresses only the quintessence of life and of its events, never these themselves.I agree with him. Music is subtle. Words as media aren't as subtle. They have meaning. They have a form. Word 'x' can only have one meaning. It's fixed. Music goes beyond. It has no meaning. Notes have impressions. They are different for different people. They have no definitions. Personally, I am not as touched by words as I am by music. Music has the power to make me feel euphoric or bring me to tears. Anything. We listen to music with our muscles, says Nietzsche. We not only listen through our ears, but our whole body, unknowing to us, listens to music. Each cell participates. Not just that, there is research suggesting that the thinking of music 'in the mind' tends to have the same impact on the brain as music itself. (I have a theory that this must be identical about sex too. That thinking of it, will have just as powerful an impact on the brain as the act itself. But I haven't read of such research on sex)There is also the theories and research about 'musical memories'. Tunes that are etched on our minds. Poems and songs we tend to remember only if we sing them in their tunes. Most fascinating of course is the use of music for therapeutic purposes. There has been extensive research throughout the world on this. There is good amount of literature in India stating the effect of various raagas in curing illnesses. Oliver Sacks is known to have used music a lot in healing neurological conditions in many of his patients. His work is well documented. I have personally been experimenting with music for long. I have started maintaining a diary of it. I seem to have Chromesthesia, so I wish to get some insights from neurologists some day. I have also known (since the time I can remember) that music has a very strong hold / deep impact on me. Sound itself has that effect. Just when I thought I was recovering, I went into a major depressive episode after listening to death metal rock music for a couple of days. Let me be clear, that I happened to like it. Or I wouldn't have listened to it. Despite that, there was a clear relapse. So much so that I found it hard to get out of bed for 3 straight days. (This happened 2 months back). I am not entirely sure if there is any connection between the two but I am too scared to try immediately now! But I do hope to go back to trying it again to see the impact of death metal on me some day. Similar has been my journey with Indian classical music. I have been using it on myself for therapeutic purpose for quite some time now. I have also made it a point to not read about the purpose before hand. This helps me in making sure that my mind is not prejudiced by my reading of therapeutic advantages of Indian classical music. If it helps it helps, if it doesn't it doesn't. I wouldn't want a placebo! So far, Raag Tilak Kamod, Bageshree, and Hamsadhwani have really helped in lifting my spirits. Maalkauns, Behag and Komal Rishabh Asavari are very touching and I find myself moved to tears quite often by them. (These tears are happily emotional!). Ahir Bhairav is meditative. So is Bhairav and Todi. I am listening and maintaining a diary of the effect of music on me! I would some day love to expand this research on others to see if the results match. Additionally, I am fascinated by the sound of language. I enjoy listening to any foreign tongue. It is highly pleasurable. I also listen to music without paying heed to the language. My brain is so trained to ignore the words while listening to music that I have to take efforts to appreciate the lyrics! As a result, I can sing in about 15-16 languages without understanding the words at all. My musical memory seems to be superb! So no, there is no way around it. Man is a musical creature too. Just as he is a linguistic and sexual creature. You cannot have alternatives to that. For more of these, follow my blog - Mindful musings."

S" Critical thinking is the ability to think with neutral perspective, the ability to look at the situation, reason with it and come to a logical and rational conclusion. (Concluding is optional!) It involves looking the things with clarity. For without clarity, there cannot be critical analysis. The difference critical thinking makes in our life is this - To know this difference too, you need some amount of critical thinking. (Recent insight!)There is no point talking more about the advantages of critical thinking. I believe they are fairly clear and known. The important question is, how do we develop this ability. Critical thinking requires experience, practice and a lot of contemplation. I know a very nice Sanskrit term which can greatly help in learning to develop critical thinking. That term is - 'Saakshi bhaav'This means developing the point of view of a 'witness'. Removing yourself from the situation and looking at things. Creating the distance. I know (from personal, first hand experience) this is easier said than done. But I also believe that with understanding, contemplating, introspecting and practice, we can try and develop this. Here's what I have found useful practically -  Not clinging to any beliefs too tightly! - You can cling. You may be convinced about something. You may have strong opinions. Fair enough. Just keep in mind that they can be wrong! Be open to be proved wrong!If you are open to be proved wrong, you can look at any new proposition with an open mind. Examine it from every angle. Analyse. If you think it is worth considering and changing your existing notions for, you will go ahead. If not, you can dismiss it. In either case, you have nothing to lose! Once you don't cling to any belief, you are open. You are receptive. And you begin to analyze everything critically. Removing yourself from the situation.

S" The biggest benefit women have is lack of responsibility. I may end up riling some of you at the first sentence, but I request you to read further. Women are taken care of in any patriarchal system. When I say taken care of, I don't necessarily mean in a manner they would like. The point is, all the decisions are taken by men. What sucks is, women get no freedom. But freedom always comes with responsibility. When you take away one, you take away the other too. This lack of responsibility is also a form of convenience. Even today when we can, I see girls not taking decisions for themselves because that comes with consequences. It is easier to allow someone else to decide for you and not take responsibility. As an added benefit, you can also later blame them if it doesn't work out and gain sympathy for being helpless while in reality it is learned helplessness. Every abused woman who chooses to still remain in the abuser - victim pattern is doing exactly this. Not embracing freedom because it comes with responsibility. It takes you out of your comfort zone. Out of known waters. Out of the convenience of familiarity. Personally, I would any day embrace freedom with the responsibility rather than the lack of both but not many choose that even when they can. And I can understand the temptation. This is the biggest benefit women have in patriarchy. Lack of responsibility. It takes courage to be free. Not all of us are ready for it. Having said that, let me also say that this answer is an observation. Not a springboard for generalized blame or condemnation. For more such posts, follow my blog - Mindful musings"

S' Guilt eats you from inside. I know that well. There are a few things that can be done about it. From all that you have written, I see the following - I see a teenager who didn\'t know how to handle his sexuality. (It can happen). I see a young boy who wasn\'t very clear about the concept of consent. (It can happen)I see a young man living in the past. (It can happen)I see a young man torn between wanting to take responsibility by confessing his actions while fearing people\'s judgment. (Most natural)I see a young man battling shame. (Toxic. But it can happen)Here are a few things that can help - You cannot change your pastYou just can\'t. So, feeling ashamed and guilty won\'t help. It is natural to feel it though. So, even if you think your feelings won\'t change, your actions can. Change your present and future. This you are already doing so good. Channelize your guilt and shameYou want to confess? Confession is taking responsibility. But remember confession is not for others. It is for you. So, you do not owe it to others to know this about you. You owe it to yourself to feel whole. So, choose one person. A person who you think will understand. If you don\'t have any such person, go to a therapist. Talking to a neutral third person is good enough. Confess. Let it all out. Take responsibility but don\'t overdo it. In my case, I was overdoing it. Classic neurosis. Forgive yourselfRegardless of whether or not your wrong was intentional, it hurt another person. That is pain to someone else at your behest. Feeling guilty is a natural byproduct of it. Transform that guilt into remorse. When you feel guilty, it is still about you. "How could I do it?".. "I am the most pathetic person under the sun"... So on and so forth. Wallowing in self-pity. Remorse is when the sorrow for the other person is the base of your pain. It happens through empathy. When you see it all like this, you would be able to forgive yourself. Not to let yourself off the hook easily, but to understand and feel that your actions have the potential of hurting others. With that realization and power comes a huge responsibility of not hurting others and behaving responsibly. If you feel that pain, you would find it in your heart to forgive yourself as well as others (if they have wronged you in any manner. Because I know that often, underneath one wrong, there is another one and the cycle continues. It may not be that girl you troubled, it could be someone else. Whoever or whatever that is, forgive that too. Or you would never move on).This has been one of the greatest lessons of my life too. Responsibility, remorse and forgiveness.

S" The reason why government policies come out in Hindi and English is because those are the two official languages of the Central government. The states have state languages, along with English as official languages. Aravind Aldk's answer is ridiculous. Nobody is trying to prove the superiority of any language. Nor is there any Aryan Dravidian nonsense fight involved in this. When India became independent, in 1947 the situation was this - There was utter chaos. There were princely states within the control of the kings. More than 500 of them. There were British presidency towns like Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. (Those were the names then. Now they are called Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata). And then there were cities like Goa and Pondicherry not under the control of either the British or the Indians. On top of that there was the Hindu - Muslim divide increased manifold due to the partition. Add to all this the fact that each region in India, spoke a different language with a distinct script of its own!When the Constitution was being drafted, the issue of official language of India came up. English wasn't spoken by even 1% of the population back then and even today majority Indians prefer Indian languages over English. What's more, that was the language of the colonizers. So, the framers were certain that one of the official languages of India had to be an Indian language. What do you do when you are stuck with a subcontinent where people spoke so many diverse languages? This was the actual situation - There are three groups of languages in India. Indo-Aryan, Indo-Dravidian and Sino-Indian languages. Indo Dravidian Languages include the 4 south Indian languages ( Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam) along with the dialects thereof. Sino Indian languages are languages of the North-East India.The rest of the languages are Indo-Aryan (like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali etc.) At the time of framing of the Constitution 24% of India's population spoke Indo Dravidian Languages with 12% among them speaking Telugu. So, any Indo Dravidian language becoming the Official language of India was simply not practical. The population speaking Sino Indian languages was negligible.The Rest of the population in India i.e. 76% spoke Indo Aryan Languages. Out of these 76%, percentage of people speaking Hindi and its dialects was 44%. See the problem now? The framers chose Hindi because at least a chunk of the population spoke the language. Additionally, the rest of the population which spoke Indo-Aryan languages, understood Hindi for the most part even if they couldn't speak it fluently. Therefore, it has nothing to do with which language is superior or inferior. A side note on linguistic fights in India - Stop the ridiculous fights about which language is superior to which other because it is X years old or close to Sanskrit or some other such reason. Learn languages wherever you can. They are tools of communication. Not ammunition to fuel bigotry. For more about Indian law, Constitution, her governance and politics follow my blog - Blawgniti"

Including Yoga or any other physical exercise you have been doing. Truth be told, Yoga or other similar practices are very conducive to Vipassana. But then if you do it all together you won't be able to see the exact effect Vipassana has on you. You won't know what contributed how much. This is the reason they ask you to stop everything else and only do Vipassana when you do a course. To see what Vipassana does to you. Once you are out, you can combine, experiment and do whatever you like. Vipassana is free from dogma. Don't get entangled in rules. There aren't any.

S" Is RSS really that bad? Absolutely not. RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) is a nationalist organization. I have seen and experienced just the opposite of what is reported. I grew up in a very 'Sanghi' environment! I grew up around RSS. My father used to be a Sanghachalak for many years. Most of his friends have been in RSS. Most of my family has been associated with RSS with my grand parents supporting RSS against the British rule. All I learnt and saw was love for India (matrubhoomi) and service to the society. A lot of things that are taught are essentially Hindu. Hindu festivals are celebrated. Soldiers are sent 'Raakhis'*. Children are taught Yoga and other healthy things. Indian arts and culture is promoted. Malla Khamb and traditional Indian body building is taught. Beyond that,wherever there is a natural disaster, help is provided. RSS men often have been the first ones to respond. RSS volunteers often aid the Army in rescue operations. Cleanliness drives are conducted. For intellectual stimulation, speeches of scholars from all walks of life are organized. Basically, people unite as Hindus and do constructive things for the society. To me, that's a good thing. Specially, given that no other religion is an exception to this. That is why I cannot understand why Hindus uniting as Hindus is suddenly a problem. For some reason, Indian media has tried very hard to convince people that being Hindu and stating it is something to be ashamed of. Or anti Secular. These people have not bothered to even read the dictionary definition of Secularism. So, I care a hang about what such paid media with ulterior motives say. In a way, Modi's victory tells me that people haven't really been fooled by the pseudo secularism of mainstream media and congress party. Why does it have so many members & supporters if it is so bad?Because the people who support RSS have seen what it is like. They have known the people from RSS. They are not some crazy fundamentalists. They are normal people like you and me. And even when I don't agree with some ideas of the RSS, I don't demonize them. Because that's false propaganda. People realize there are countless good things they've been doing for a long time. And the idiots who make stupid comments are exceptions blown out of proportion. I remember just one memory about what RSS men do. Earliest memory actually thatis etched in my mind. I was about 10. My teacher's husband was deathly sick. He was in the Hospital for months. They were from Odisha and didn't speak Marathi. They had no relatives or people who could help. They weren't in financial trouble. Just that she had 2 small children and couldn't leave them alone or take them to the hospital 24*7. The minute my father came to know, he asked some of the boys who used to attend his Shaakha ( RSS meet) for help. These were 20 year old boys. For the next 9 months, one or the other boy would sleep in the hospital with that man. Every night. My teacher still ties Raakhi to my father and two others who were there for her in her time of need. This is RSS. To this day, I am confident that if I go to any unknown city, I can go to the house of a person from RSS and I am certain I will be taken care of. * Raakhi is a sacred thread tied by a woman to her brother (or brother like relation) on the Indian festival of Raksha Bandhan.It symbolizes and celebrates the protective love that exists between brothers and sisters."

S" Let me be honest and tell you, Classical music many times is an acquired taste. Personally, I was exposed to classical music since infancy. Apparently, I used to listen with a lot of focus.Then there came a stage where I was a fan of a lot of contemporary music and rebelled against everything old! That was in early teens. Of course I realized in about 2 years that my first love will be Carnatic Classical music! The other reason of my exposure to Carnatic Classical music was learning Bharathnatyam. With Hindustani classical music, my interest and love grew with a lot of time and serious listening. Let me tell you something about classical music (Specially Hindustani classical music) - Hindustani classical music is melody based (So is Carnatic). Any rendition, starts with Vilambit lay (very slow tempo), then you have Madhya lay (medium tempo), and then Drut lay (Fast tempo). Our ears are not exposed to appreciate the nuances of Vilambit (slow tempo). We haven't acquired the taste. It sounds the same. The truth of course is the fact that the rendition is so nuanced, that a lay ear cannot capture the intricacy. Which is why a lot of people find it boring, monotonous or drone like. So, as a beginner, you can start with Drut Bandish (fast tempo) of any raaga. Then go to Madhya lay (medium tempo) and then Vilambit lay (slow tempo).If I have to use an analogy, I can compare it with the movements in Art! (There you go. I can't help evoke a visual with sound! Even if it is intellectual.) We attained a sort of zenith with classicism. The classic paintings were nuanced, deep and very detailed. They had definitions, structure, methods, forms and a lot of intricacies. And then came Romanticism or even better, Impressionism! While it brings a beauty of its own, the classic paintings too deserve to be relished! But by now, we are used to flamboyant use of colours, impressions, reveling the beauty of the entire painting instead of taking the time to appreciate each stroke of a classic painting. So, to slow down, efforts are required. Another perspective needs to be developed.Same is the case with classical music. The most practicable method to do so is to take a plunge. Listen. Listen a lot. Listen to different styles (gharanas). Listen to vocals and instrumentals. Listen to different raagas and listen to the same raagas again and again. Listen to thumri (semi classical), Dhrupad (A different and older style of classical singing.) and Khyal (contemporary classical music). Start with Drut (fast tempo) or even fusion if you like that better. Or start with Taranas (the Carnatic equivalent is Thillana). Tarana is a composition where syllables are chosen for their rhythmic beauty and pleasing sound and don't have any meaning.Excellent for beginners. Enjoy the music. Flow with it and be mindful of the things it evokes within you.Music is my life's greatest pleasure. :)Just FYI - By the end of it though, I hope you know you don't have to like Hindustani classical music! Now for some delicious recommendations, you can begin with - 1.

S" Men who can cook and enjoy doing it are very Sexy! In general I find people who are doing what they love very sexy. It's a very attractive quality. In the culture I come from (Indian), traditionally, men don't make meals at home. That's always the woman's job. Because of this background, Indian men who love cooking are all the more attractive because it tells me that they don't follow stereotypical gender roles and are happy to follow their heart. Cooking is an art! It takes a lot of effort. I am not much of a foodie so I am not very motivated to cook complicated things. I try to keep my meals simple and healthy. For the love of complicated food, I go eat outside! So, foodie men who enjoy cooking are quite the opposite of me. Another reason of attraction!"

Trust is an important concept to understand for any lawyer. So, even if you don't take this option, ensure that you read up the law so you know what Trusts are when you pass. It covers two statutes- Indian Trusts Act and Bombay Public Trusts Act. Criminology is the theoretical foundation of crimes and punishments in law. Provides the base for Indian Penal Code. If you do not take this option, you can read up the base of provisions when you study the IPC which will be a compulsory subject. Women and law as a subject covers all the laws relating to women and children. Some of these laws you will study in Family law, the rest of them, you can read up on your own too if you do not take this option. IT covers laws like Maternity relief Act, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, Women's rights and other provisions for and about women. International Economic law covers different economic conventions and treaties. If provides a good foundation for International law which you will study the next year anyway. Personally I find International Economic law a tad bit difficult because Economic laws are not my forte. The others are fairly simple. When I was a student, I had chosen Trusts for its practical importance. P.S. The syllabus may have changed a bit and I am not very sure of all the laws that are covered under 'Women and law'. I am fairly certain that I am right in general. For more on Indian laws, follow my blog - Blawgniti"

S' This question is Compound. I\'ll try and peel it. Let\'s address the core beliefs that are untrue and often confused - 1. Firstly, most people think that worrying about others feelings shows that you care. Care shows that you love. If you don\'t worry, it means you do not care. If you do not care, you do not love.Worrying ==> Caring ==> Love2. Worrying (implied caring and love) about others feelings means complying with their demands. If you do not comply, that means you do not care. 3. Worrying (implied caring and love) about others feelings means giving them a priority over your own. If you don\'t, you are selfish or "emotionally strong"!. 4. If you don\'t worry (again implied caring and love) about their feelings you are emotionally strong. Because that shows you are not dependent on people. That you don\'t need emotional anchors. 5. Emotional strength is antagonistic to emotional expression. (And emotional expression of course is just the expression of worry with the implied caring and love idea)All of the above notions are not true. Let\'s get the difference between worrying and caring. For this context here, I do not mean the worry you feel for your loved one when they are battling cancer! I speak only in the context of this question. Let\'s say you are going for an adventure. Let\'s say you are going to trek the Himalayas. It is your dream. But it is also a bit dangerous. As your lover, I am concerned. Now I can give two different kind of reactions. Scene one - I say - Hey I am really concerned about you. I will be a little worried because the trek is dangerous but I know it\'s your dream. So, break a leg! Enjoy. I am waiting for you, eager to hear all about it! Scene two - I say- Hey I am very worried about you. Do you know how dangerous it is? I will not allow you to go because I cannot bear to lose you. If you also felt the same about me, you wouldn\'t go. If you go, that tells me you are abandoning me. You don\'t love me. In both these scenarios, you are expressing concern. But in the former it is caring. The latter is worry. The former has the other person\'s thought at the base. The latter is about you! Love is about the other. Love is about freedom. Caring. Balancing your needs with that of the other without either trying to control or becoming a doormat. An emotionally strong person understands this difference. Cares for people but doesn\'t worry.

S" Mooting is what will really make you understand the law. Law and its application are very different things. Never leave an opportunity to moot. Whether to do it or not is still your choice but if you ask me is mooting important, I'd say very. VERY! Having said that, let me tell you how. Moot is where you will come across a legal problem. When you prepare for law exams, all you do is study the law and caselaws. Mooting gives you a taste of the application of law. Study of law is peculiar in a way. In the sense that the purpose of law is to regulate. The aim of a lawyer is to interpret the law and find a loophole in it. This is how law gets developed. All of this cannot happen if you cannot think as to how you can argue that will bring forth the loophole!Mooting does it for a student. It gives you an opportunity to study and actually apply the law. Argue it and convince another person about it. Lastly, it's the most fun thing a law student can do. Enjoy it. Learn from it. :)"

S' This isn\'t a fun or sweet answer, but a serious one. Deception starts at a very young age. A lot of it is unintentional of course, but it contributes on the whole. When a parent feels angry at the child and instead of healthily expressing it, shows love, it\'s deception. Express anger (albeit healthily) and your child will know that her actions can evoke anger in people and she will then have to deal with the consequences of it.  She will also understand that it is Okay to be angry and express it. When parents overdo the "Oh you are very special" with their children, they deceive them. I think appreciating every thing the child does, even if they suck at it, is unhealthy and deceptive. Trying to learn something new as an approach should be encouraged and appreciated, but if the child draws a monkey while aiming to draw an elephant, she should be told what it really looks like. And rather than saying she did a great job, she should be told it is not great drawing but if she enjoys drawing she should do it anyway.Parents should know the difference between appreciating the effort and appreciating the final product. The world cares a hang about your effort and children should learn that.When parents try to over protect their children and in the process don\'t ever have a disagreement in front of the children, they deceive them. They deceive them into believing in a world without disagreements while in reality it is impossible to find two people agreeing on everything. I think children should be taught to communicate disagreements without so much as raising their voices. Self assertion and considering another point of view are very important skills to learn and people later join classes to learn it! I believe it can be taught quite easily if parents themselves have good communication and understanding. All in all, I think most parents do end up deceiving children one way or another. The best way children deceive themselves is by blaming it all on the parents!! There is always a limitation period on blaming your parents! After a point, regardless of their deceptions, it is always on you! For more of such mindful babble, follow my blog - Mindful musings'

S" I don't know what 'should' be done. Frankly, that word always puts me off! I always tread very carefully when people start talking about 'shoulds'!I am more interested in inquiring into the reasons of the fixation with 'should' than the 'should'. But my OCD aside, here's what I think! Personal opinion - 'You've got to do what you've got to do whether you want it or not'Plain and simple. Know that even in situations you feel helpless in, where you think you have no choice, you are still making a choice. Maybe the choice is between bad and worse, but it is still a choice. So, whatever you feel, helpless or not, you've got to do what you've got to do. And face the full consequences of that. You cannot choose the consequences. I take a lot of inspiration from Michael Corleone from the Godfather. I like him for this very reason. He never wanted to get into the 'family business'. But when he does, he makes a choice and takes the full consequences. He knows 'wants' don't always materialize. Similar is the situation in Mahabharata. Where a lot of characters make hard choices, but they do what they believe needs to be done. And take the consequences. Like I said - You've got to do what you've got to do. Lastly, life doesn't present itself exactly as we want. It is random and it is indifferent to us. It is upon us to find our meaning. To do. And to react. That is in our hands.

S" I can think of two theories here - 1. Every idea is original if you can come up with a new way of saying itEvery idea any person has, is built on something. There is no such thing as an original idea. So, find a new way of saying it. Old wine in a new bottle. 2. Come up with a novel idea no-one has heard of - How can you do that? Again, I don't have any such ideas but I can think of the theory of it. Something novel means something which is not heard of before. How do you come up with it? By thinking in a way that is not 'obvious'. Anything which is obvious isn't really novel. Pick your choice. Either of the two may work. The former needs your skills, the latter is more of a 'Flash of genius' and may or may not happen in your life. Lastly, I hope you know it's okay to not have any new ideas!

S" Fascinating question. One that has haunted me time and again. Not just Karna, every commander of the Kaurava Army is killed by unethical means. Bheeshma is killed by bringing Shikhandi and exploiting Bheeshma's vow. Drona is killed by Yudhishthir lying about the death of his son which deeply saddens him and he gives up his arms. ( The famous 'Naro va Kunjaro va' scene) Karna is killed when he was disarmed. Even Duryodhana despite the Pandavas nearly winning the battle is killed by Bheema unethically. He is hit under the waist against the rules of the mace battle. One possible explanation is already well articulated by Ishita. I would try and look at it from another perspective. And again, this is my perspective. Very personal. I think throughout Mahabharata, everyone is trying to find 'Dharma'. But it remains elusive. We never get an answer. Whether it is Krishna convincing Arjuna to fight with his impeccable arguments, or it is Karna remaining loyal to Duryodhana despite knowing that he is Kunti's son, or it is Bheeshma sticking to his vow despite there being dire necessity for him to let it go, or any other situation, where every character ends up making a choice. Everybody uses the arguments that suit them. Every body thinks they are following Dharma. So, saying Mahabharata was a 'Dharma Yuddha' need not necessarily mean that whatever happened in the war was right. It can possibly mean that the Yuddha (war) was a way of trying to find 'Dharma'. Seek it. Follow it. Everyone is trying to do it in their own ways.Who truly won and who truly lost... who is right and who is wrong... who is good and who is bad... What is dharma and what is not... Who's to say? You seek for yourself and find! Because despite being God, Krishna is killed by a stray arrow. Despite winning, the Pandavas are never happy and finally renounce the throne. Despite winning, Krishna is cursed by Gandhari and the curse comes to fruition. Despite losing, Karna is the greatest lamented hero and is lauded by one and all. Mahabharata never says the heroes won and end of story. It tells you that even for the heroes to win, every commander of the Kaurava Army had to be killed unethically. It tells you that despite his faults, Duryodhana was known for his generosity to friends and despite his greatness, Yudhishthir had a weakness for dice games and over-pragmatism (Ok, that is my opinion!!). Mahabharata is about seeking Dharma. It demonstrates that the path of Dharma is subtle. Not black and white. It doesn't give you custom made right answers. It forces you to think. And choose. The quintessential dilemmas of life! For more such posts and answers, follow my blog - Mindful musings"

If I have to use an analogy, I would say it's similar to the gut wrenching feeling you have right before you are going to vomit.

So believe me, I know coping with it is not easy. Please go see a therapist. She can help you. When you think it is unbearable and you fear you might actually take a step, call a friend. Or call your therapist. Give yourself half an hour. Distract yourself somehow. But in the long run, please visit a therapist. Remember again, one day at a time... One battle at a time...

S" I think the wisdom of Godfather doesn't come from any theory or thought. (Much as I would like to theorize about it!). It comes from action. From being in that situation where 'you've got to do what you've got to do!'A person who once struggled for food is going to have a very different outlook towards life than a person who doesn't even know what it is like to struggle for food. A person who hasn't eaten anything for days isn't going to think it is unethical to steal. This was with reference to Don Corleone. Don comes to America as an immigrant and builds his way up. He knows what it feels like to not have food. His ethics and his morals are very different from others. Similar situation is that of Michael when he very reluctantly enters the family business. He does what he has to do. He does what he can do best when he is pushed to a corner. I don't think there is much philosophy or wisdom there in Godfather except the fact that what you become depends on the choices you make. And both the father and the son are very clear about it. They own it up."

S' A government hospital cannot refuse a patient on any ground. On the other hand, a private hospital can refuse a patient on any ground. But neither can refuse emergency medical care. Emergency medical care is a Fundamental Right in India that is enforceable even against private hospitals. Every medical practitioner with relevant expertise is duty bound to save life and provide emergency medical care. In Paramananda Katara v. UOI, a landmark case, the SC held that right to emergency medical care was implicit in Art 21 (Right to life) of the Constitution. It went on to include medical practitioners in private hospitals and practice as well. It also says that legal formalities are to be taken care of after providing emergency medical care even in medico-legal cases. Primary responsibility is saving life.

S" Any artistic pursuit is often backed by intellectual and emotional investment. I would imagine the same with music. As a lover of music with a keen ear, I can only speculate. Every piece of art comes into existence when the creator experiences something which she wishes to express differently. A person skilled in the art of painting uses colours and a brush to express the same. A person skilled in music, uses sound and arranges the notes in such a manner that he creates magic with it. But he is also choosing to express. So, it is this emotional investment, the desire to express something special, that gives birth to the art form. It then makes sense to name it after that desire, motivation, inspiration or thought. This is what I believe. To prove my point, I present - 'Touch me there' by L.Shankar and Frank Zappa - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...It touches you there! :) Enjoy. (Wait till the violin starts)"

S" Therapy as a profession is complex. It is highly subjective. What works for one person may not work for another in identical situation. Each therapy is different. Therapists often combine a lot of techniques and bring in a lot from their own experience. An otherwise successful therapist may not 'click' with you. Which is why it is important to get a few things straight. Separate 'ineffective' therapy from 'unprofessional or hurtful'. The two are different. While the former may only be a waste of time or money, it is never truly damaging. The latter can have a bad psychological impact. So, a therapist having an affair with you is unprofessional and hurtful. A therapist judging you and making you dependent on his validation is hurtful. A therapist taking your decisions for you is hurtful. A therapist transgressing his professional sphere is hurtful. A therapist with any other agenda but your mental well being is unprofessional or hurtful. That is all. The rest may not work or 'click' with you and may prove to be ineffective. In that case, find a new one."

S" Gauri hits the nail right on its head. I am just adding to her answer. Babasaheb Purandare is a very learned historian from Maharashtra. And had the Maharashtra government taken it seriously, he would have got Bharat Ratna by now. He deserves it too. I always think, had he not been in India, had he been say in England, he would have become world famous. Such is his work! He is a brilliant historian and has brought history into every household in Maharashtra. Lucky for me, our families are close and I have visited his house plenty of times with my father. Believe me, the man walks, talks and lives history. I have witnessed it personally! People have accused him of all sorts of things. My point from the beginning has been, if you think a person's work is not credible, write critical analysis of the same. Peer- review it. Do your own research. Write books criticizing his. But his critics include organizations like Sambhaji Brigade. Well, what can you say about hooligans who are only capable of breaking and vandalizing institutes like 'Bhandarkar Institute' in Pune and nothing more than that?We possibly can't expect them to even understand what Babasaheb has written let alone peer-review it. I was happy today that the Bombay HC dismissed the ridiculous petition challenging the honour he is being given by the Maharashtra government. (Again, truth be told, this honour itself is thoroughly belated). What's more the HC has also asked the two Petitioners to pay costs for filing such a ridiculous petition. The award ceremony got over a few minutes back and watching the man speak so eloquently at 94 years of age, once again, was a pleasure! Any person who knows a little about the politics of Maharashtra knows that maligning Babasaheb is politically motivated. The politics is about castes. The problem being the fact that Babasaheb, sadly for them, is a Brahmin. A fact that should make no difference in front of his body of work. But like I said, what can you expect from puny, pathetic souls whose only reason of existence seems to be seeing castes in other people's surnames?Lastly (and understandably) that is all that they are capable of seeing and understanding. Reading his books requires a lot of effort and some amount of brain. P.S. Seeing my caste in my surname and writing me hate mails will prove my point."

And I do believe reading helps with that because reading expands our imagination and mind. But reading isn't the only thing that helps in being open. The other thing that should follow reading, is contemplating. Reading provides an excellent springboard for contemplation. I interact with people normally.

S" Well, it's complicated. In the sense that the legal position is not very clear. You will not be affected by religion if you don't let yourself be. You are allowed to not follow any religion (or follow) and you are allowed to convert into another by choice. You are allowed to marry under the Special Marriage Act if you are not inclined to have a religious wedding. The problem comes in succession. Adoption. If you are a Hindu, you are governed by the Hindu Adoption and maintenance Act. If you are a Muslim, you cannot adopt unless you follow the specific set of conditions. Muslim women cannot adopt a child.If you are a Hindu and if you wish to make a will, you cannot give away your ancestral property. You can do what you want with your self acquired one. If you are a Muslim, you cannot give away more than 1/3rd of your property by will anyway. In case you die without making a will (intestate succession), the devolution of your property will take place based on your religion. So, if you are a Hindu, Hindu succession Act will apply. The only option for you if you do not want to these laws to apply to you is to convert into another religion in which case the laws of that religion would apply. There is no 'default law' or Uniform civil code that would apply to you without inquiring into your religion. So, legally, you cannot be an Atheist. But nobody will bother you if you don't believe in a religion. You can choose to not be associated, but in certain matters, the law would apply. High time the current government at least shows some spine and get a Uniform Civil Code and be done with religious laws. One law for every Indian.

S' Wow. I quite connect to this question. I battle this feeling all the time. It is good that you are not suicidal. I have felt both the extremes. And I know that we have two options. One is to quit. Now that quitting could be either by actually taking your life, or resigning to feeling that life is a meaningless pursuit. The other is to give meaning to your life. And I use my words judiciously. I say \'give\' meaning. Because it is our job. Life doesn\'t owe it to us. It tries hard though!! :)Life can only be as meaningful or as meaningless as we make it.I find myself going back to \'Man\'s search for meaning\' by Viktor Frankl many times. A gem of a book. And I feel the answer to human search in part lies in there. "A man who has a why to live for can bear almost any how"So, making life a meaningful pursuit is on you. It is always a choice. There is no answer written by God in some book as to whether life is a meaningful pursuit or not. If it is, it\'s still your choice to follow it or not. Viktor Frankl gives a beautiful insight in his book. And I tend to agree with him a lot on it. He says man is a creature of meaning. That above happiness, we search for meaning. And that is the permanent (not momentary) happiness. Finding a \'why\' to live for. That final search, the purpose of our existence is what gives us true joy. Gives meaning to our life. If I tell you life is a meaningless pursuit and if you buy it, it\'s still you believing me. If I say life is meaningful, it is still on you to find your own meaning. Choose now and choose well. Give your life a meaning or don\'t, there is no final answer. It is a choice. For more of these, you can follow my blog - Mindful musings'

Because you cannot have a running race when the starting point itself for the participants is different. If that is the case, then you need to first get the other runners to the base line by carrying them in vehicles (Affirmative action) and then they can compete. Remember this has nothing to do with inherent weakness. I support only one kind of reservation for women. (Or minorities, or SCs and STs, or anyone else). Reservation of representation in the Parliament. Because we cannot make laws for women without their representation. (Same would apply to minorities, SCs and STs)This was affirmative action in practice. The last part is difference in treatment that is expected which people often confuse as antagonist to their idea of equality. Can you really treat children and old people as one? Can you treat men and women as the same? Equality is not Sameness. Equality is equal treatment of the equals. So, maternity relief granted to women is a special law only for women because they are not the same as men.When women ask for equality, it is equality of opportunity. That is all.

S" Having seen my share of heart breaks and pain, I often wonder, is love worth it? I wonder this immediately after the heart break. Haha.. Never after that. So, here we all are, trying to look for that one person who will rescue us, be our lover, best friend, spouse, care-taker, confidante, all in one! Why is it that adults around the world feel the need to have a companion? It is certainly very basic of human desires. One of course is to reproduce and to pass on our genes. But the other, more important one (or the one I wish to focus on) is companionship. The desire to be heard. The desire to be known. To be accepted for what we are. To be loved despite all that. To express that love physically. Sex is one part. The other more important psychological and emotional need is to be loved through our bodies. To experience intimacy. Emotional and physical intimacy. In love, we expose ourselves fully. The best and the worst. We all have demons and we all want to be loved despite our demons. Love is this essential challenge to our need to feel secure! We experience two simultaneous pulls. One to be safe and secure, while the other is to fully expose ourselves and be vulnerable. Love therefore, takes courage. It mandates that we leave our secure shore, let our defenses down and take a plunge! The most essential need we all have is - 'To matter to someone'. In love, that is felt deeply. In heart breaks, that is what gets hit. But when you have seen and truly felt love, regardless of the heartbreaks, the person will always matter. And love will always feel worth it.

S" And Islamic invasion and demolition of the Temple in Ayodhya was a precursor for the Babri Masjid Demolition. Or the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits in 1989 was a precursor for the demolition. Can I say that?I mean the foolish arguments would become endless then, wouldn't they?So, do not buy the nonsense politicians come up with. Rioting is different from planting a bomb and waging war against the state. Demolition of a monument is not the same as planting a bomb and killing innocent civilians. Law deals with both separately and that is already being done. The Ayodhya case is sub-judice and Yakub Memon was finally hanged. Good riddance. PS. The first paragraph is a demonstration of foolish arguments. Not an argument I am making. That is how people are provoked. By making foolish arguments."

S' Infidelity can either become an opportunity to strengthen your relationship or gracefully move away from one another. There are two parts here. One is your part, the other is his. You can do yours in making him trust you. But he won\'t trust you fully unless he does his part too. An affair is not the problem. It can be a symptom of the problem. And I say \'it can be\'. So, if you both feel (he should feel it in equal measure. I write this answer presuming he feels it in equal measure) that you should be taking this opportunity to strengthen your bond, the following things can be done to get back trust and better your relationship. Remember a lot of relationships merely survive an affair. Do you really want just survival? Or do you want a beautiful relationship much better than what existed before the affair? Aim for the latter. For you (The person who had the affair) - 1. You need to stop the affair. First step. Tell your partner it\'s over. In that process, if you have to let go off some of your freedom, do it. 2. Apologize for hurting him. Now there are two parts to this apology and you therefore need to inquire into yourself. A lot of people feel apologetic for hurting their spouse but don\'t necessarily feel apologetic for the affair itself. There is a difference. Key difference. Introspect and find out what do you feel apologetic about. Don\'t judge yourself, just introspect. Don\'t tell yourself what you "should" be feeling. Just find out what you actually feel. If you do not regret the affair, your relationship with your husband is far worse than you think. If this is truly the situation, then you need to check why do you wish to live with him. Is it really love? Or is it other things which your mind disguises as love? Introspect well.Most people who don\'t regret the affair itself either quit from the first relationship (as they probably should), or merely survive without realizing why. So, introspect. If you truly regret the affair, apologize. No buts, no justifications, plain and simple sorry. Assure him it would never happen again. 3. Sex - Well, given that he is a man, sexual affair for him is the most painful. If you were to have an emotional one, he wouldn\'t bat an eye! Cheating according to me happens in many forms. There is the cheating by contempt, cheating by neglect, cheating by emotional affairs, and cheating by indifference. Sexual cheating hits worst. More so for men and I believe the reasons for this are very very interesting but since they are not the topic of this answer, I will not go there. Know and understand that sexual cheating will break him and fixing it is a task. Immediately in the aftermath of an affair, there is an upsurge of sexual activity between the couple. This is mainly to ward off the effect of the affair. You real work would begin months later. To assure him. To make him feel wanted. An affair tells him that he is rejected. You have to make him believe he isn\'t and would never be. He is needed, wanted. Remember, feeling wanted, is very different from feeling loved. And if you cheated out of this reason, you will very well see the difference. Lastly, forgive yourself. For Him (the person whose spouse had an affair) - 1. Victim of an affair need not necessarily be the victim of the marriage - Your first job is to not find out the details. I know this is hard, but the details are only going to hurt you more. So, control that temptation. Questions like "Was he better than me?, How did you do it? Which position? Where? How many times?", all of these need to be curbed. Instead, ask the questions that really will make a difference. Ask the person what the affair meant to her. How did she feel in that relationship that she couldn\'t in the first one. What was going through her mind before and after it. Ask these kind of questions which will help you both see as to what the affair meant. End of the day, that is what matters. Once you see what the affair meant to her, it will probably point at the flaw in your relationship. You can then work on it. What happens in a marriage / long term committed relationship is that you take the other person for granted. We treat our spouse like she can never leave. She is never truly yours. But she can be. From moment to moment. That\'s how you make "ever after".2. If you truly love her, trusting again is possible - Tell her the following - Tell her that after the affair, you are going to trust her even more. Blindly so. You would never ever check her phone or anything else. You now know that it is possible for a spouse to be attracted to another and cheat. While it is hurtful to the other, it can happen. So, living on tenterhooks is pathetic. You will trust her to tell you if she finds herself straying again. And then the call would be yours. Whether to continue or move away. Know that she cannot make you trust her if you don\'t allow yourself to. If you constantly keep digging, neither of you can ever be happy together. So, you\'ve got to take a blind leap of faith. 3. Do not presume a moral high ground - Most often the deceived spouse is going to feel - "Do you think I didn\'t feel attracted to others? But I didn\'t go cheat. I didn\'t stoop as low as you." Presuming a moral high ground will never work if you wish to fix the relationship. It will initially make the person who cheated more guilty but above that nothing else. You end up increasing the gap between you two. She not only feels guilty, she also now can never talk to you about the affair openly because you bring morality into the picture and she will feel judged. This will lead to a relationship which will resemble a principal of a school and a spoiled student. It\'s not what you want! 4. How to deal with rejection? One spouse\'s act of sexual transgression invariably leads to the other\'s identity crisis. And most times, the identity crisis of the person who deceived too. (This nobody will tell you!)So feeling rejected is normal. But now, you\'ve got to dig. Not into the details of her affair, but into the details of your relationship. Very often (unless your relationship was pathetic, in which case you need not introspect at all. You will know), the reason to stray has less to do with you (or rejecting you) and more to do with either the third person or your partner\'s own self. What she feels in your relationship (or what she has become as a result), is what she is rejecting. Not you. That is what she wants to go away from. Not necessarily you. That is why, before taking it all very personally, inquire. Once you know the reason and are certain you love her too, move ahead to making it work. Know that it is both your responsibility and not hers alone. To both - Treat the aftermath of an affair as a second marriage and start over. Fresh. I draw quite a lot from the work of Esther Perel and Janis Spring. These two have contributed a lot to my own understanding of psychology. Do read their books.

S" Quora is teeming with lists of all sorts of books that should be read, and I have provided a few of them, so I won't put up a list again. Also, it is really hard to state absolutes when there is so much diversity in content, languages and readability when it comes to books, hence I can provide a check-list of what content one should ideally cover in their twenties (along with what I read, if I did, in tandem with that) - 1. A bitter-sweet love story.No, Chetan Bhagat's stories do not count. Twenties are the time to build new relationships, and experience changes in old relationships. Understanding them through a non-rose-tinted lens, yet in a balanced and not necessarily calculated manner is vital. My picks - Rau, Gone with the Wind.2. An inspirational book.This is the time to dream dreams and believe in every bit of them. Be it a person or an idea, reading about something that inspires and keeps you going stays in your heart - and your cupboard- for long.My pick - Eka Dishecha Shodh.3. War.Violence and full-scale wars are not an integral part of many people's lives, but it is important to be introduced to that aspect of humanity. It gives you a perspective of our dark side through your own imagination, and heightens your ability to empathise and recognise the flip and pathetic side of war.My picks - All Quiet on the Western Front, Dresden.4. History.It never hurts to know some, and it always benefits to know as much as possible. Do not limit it to a region or person or a period.My picks - Shreeman Yogi, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Eka Teliyane. 5. Travel.Travelling extensively in the twenties is the best thing ever, but if it doesn't work out practically, go for the next best thing - read about it. Travel experiences of other people, if well explained, can go a long way in fuelling your imagination and insight about the world surrounding you.My pick - From Heaven Lake.6. A 'disturbing' book.A book that reaches out to how you have been viewing the world, and shows you an aspect of it you never even thought of. A books that takes you out of your comfort zone and makes you think. And most probably end with you not feeling very good.My picks - Animal Farm, 1984.7. A philosophical book.Food for your grey cells. My picks - Dasbodh, Bhagwad Gita. (both unfinished)8. Classic Short Stories.A good short story is a tequila shot of the intricacies of human nature. The classic ones, though a bit wordy, are both exotic and familiar and stand the test of time. They are a quick read as well.My picks - stories by Gulzar, Saki, Somerset Maugham, O. Henry, Ruskin Bond. 9. Humour and Entertainment.A chuckle to a full dose of laughter, and you will not want anything else. My picks - The Corfu Trilogy, The Jeeves Omnibus, works of Pu La Deshpande. (some unfinished)10. A non-academic book related closely to your field of study/work.Face it, textbooks can get boring after a point of time. To keep your appetite intact, delve into the more entertaining/thought-provoking/real-life aspects of your subject of study/work.My pick - Freakonomics, Water Wars.11. A classic.Just because.My picks - Arthashastra (unfinished), Mrutyunjay, The Count of Monte Cristo, Around the World in 80 Days, Old Man and the Sea, Jane Eyre.12. Thrillers and Detective Stories.They are a fascinating insight into human psychology.My picks - The Unexpected Guest (Agatha Christie), Sherlock Holmes.This list by no means is exhaustive - it can be something you can begin with. The key, I feel, is to identify aspects of life which you directly or indirectly experience (or further, don't experience at all) and read works and content which comforts, stabilises and enriches those experiences."

S" Not exactly ancient history, but one decent movie about a period in India before the British is Jodhaa Akbar by Ashutosh Gowarikar.It is an out-and-out commercial movie, but manages to retain decency and sense, without any of the loudness and flamboyance most of the commercial blockbuster hits rely on. I do not know how historically accurate the story is, but it is acceptable, and quite engaging.The sets and actors brim and overflow with beauty, and the music is simply superb. Ashutosh Gowarikar manages to tone down Hrithik Roshan's hyper acting to the level that his face now permanently represents a young Akbar to everyone who has watched this film - just as Prithviraj Kapoor personifies an old Akbar for everyone who has watched Mughal-e-Azam. Aishwarya Rai looks pretty as usual, and her toned down, non-plastic-y version is refreshing as well. Other actors do justice to their roles, too.The movie is slightly long (but then, we are talking Ashutosh Gowarikar...) but it does not bore or make you glance into your watch. A simple, decent, tastefully made period film - boy, we do need more of those.Are you looking forward to watching Bajirao Mastani, by the way? It releases on 18th December.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...My most favourite hero ever!I can't wait!! :)"

S' As Abhijeet said, the \'rest of Maharashtra\' is too diverse to be clubbed together, but while it can still glue together as a state over quite a few aspects, Mumbai stands apart - and no, it\'s not just because of the roaming charges you start incurring once you enter Mumbai.Mumbai is more cosmopolitan and \'least Marathi\' than the rest of Maharashtra. That is manifest most clearly in terms of language and food, but also through entertainment options, customs and subtly, through clothing. The Marathi spoken across the state varies from sub-region to sub-region, and so do foodstuffs and customs, but Mumbai is starkly different, with areas that don\'t speak any Marathi at all, don\'t sell any Maharashtrian food or food products, and have no inkling of local Marathi festivals.Mumbai beats each and every city in the state when it comes to pace of life. Hell, I feel it beats every city across the country as well. Mumbai is incredibly fast, hurtling continuously towards achieving one goal, only to hurtle again towards the next. Anyone who paints a picture of Maharashtrians based on Mumbai\'s pace will be surprised to know that Maharashtrians in the rest of the state, including those in more developed cities like Pune, Nasik, Kolhapur, Aurangabad and Nagpur, are way slower, relaxed and chilled out and have a lot more time in their hands.Rest of Maharashtra is more conservative than Mumbai. Mumbai might very well be an international city, but the rest of the state is very much \'Indian\'; a majority lives in towns and villages, is fairly religious and traditional, and less individualistic when compared to Mumbai. A Mumbaikar who has never ventured into the nooks and corners of Maharashtra would be surprised to know that many of his norms (or things he takes for granted) are their anomalies and even taboos. Gender norms, family life, concepts of privacy and social life, materialistic tastes and preferences, and overall attitudes towards life are very different and more liberal in Mumbai, and more often do not match those of rest of Maharashtra. "Money-minded" Mumbai. Mumbaikars are frequently criticised by other Maharashtrians, for their "money-minded" approach; there is definitely a certain degree of generalisation in this, but I wouldn\'t be wrong to say that Maharashtrians find Mumbaikars excessively money-oriented, measuring everything only in monetary terms.Mumbai lives \'in the present\'. Perhaps because it hardly has any significant pre-British history, or perhaps because it just does not care, Mumbai doesn\'t care about histories and glories as much as the rest of Maharashtra does. The Shivaji fad being largely political and an exception, Mumbai is largely indifferent to any historical pride. The rest of Maharashtra, notably cities like Pune, Kolhapur, Aurangabad and Nasik have a strong element of historical pride as they have been important political and/or cultural power centres at different points of time. Many more can be perceived, but it is quite challenging to state them without risking inaccurate generalisation. The ones mentioned above, however, hold ground to a considerable extent.'

S' The average Indian knows very little about Iran, and apart from "Muslim country", "conservative towards women", and "America-hater", it doesn\'t register much on his/her consciousness.Those who know a bit of history (and they are many), and that ancient Iran was known as Persia, associate Iran with having close ties with our own history. Cultural, culinary, linguistic and religious exchanges are quite widely acknowledged. Iran, then, is also associated with beautiful art and poetry, story-telling (some of the Arabian Nights tales, for example), kings and invasions, and of course, beautiful women.We also associate Iran with a minority community largely concentrated on the western coast of India (Gujarat and Maharashtra) - the Parsees. Not much is known about them to the rest of the country - except that they are peace-loving, industrious, and completely blended into the Indian fabric. The Tatas are the most famous Parsees among the masses.Those who read, and have read "Not Without My Daughter" more often than not find Iran conservative, regressive and a place "to avoid". In general, non-Muslim Indians feel a mixture of wariness and interest in Iran - they are interested to hear about it, but would hesitate to go there even temporarily, even if they would get a chance. Consequently, it is not a tourist destination for most of us. The enmity with America, the \'closed\' and non-democratic nature of the country (we hardly hear any news from there!), combined with the very popular NWMD, makes Iran look like a nebulous and slightly fearful country, albeit with an awareness that it isn\'t bad towards India.In short, we know pretty much nothing about modern day Iran - its society, economy, natural beauty, education, trends, customs, and issues. We are not sure of what we know either. Iran, for most ordinary Indians, is an old friend who left town and who we haven\'t caught up with for a long, long time.'

S' The few answers here have covered most points, so I won\'t repeat those. Instead, I\'ll mention five interesting qualities of Indians (which I always took for granted) which I (re)discovered through conversations with non-Indians.1. Survivors.Indians are survivors. They have survived invasions, famines, oppression, violence - you name it, and they still manage to scrape through and come out quite decently in the end. These are the \'all\'s well that ends well\' people, those who sincerely believe that everything happens for \'good\', that adversity is simply God\'s way of testing us and hence we should still be kind and compassionate no matter what befalls us.I have had foreigners point this out to me as a fact that struck them as naive and marvellous at the same time. It builds rock-solid resilience, allowing Indians to stand the test of time, they told me, while it also retains a childlike innocence in viewing the world and life. Extraordinary.2. Tolerance.The religion bit is not that new any more, but the Indian tolerance towards all that is unpleasant is quite a characteristic. From nosy aunts, to ill-built roads, to loud babies in theatres, to irregular milkmen and maid-servants, to corrupt bureaucrats, to blatant racism, to openly ridiculing physical deformities, to shamelessly peeping into others\' personal lives - we have it and accept it all. It was on Quora that I actually learnt that a lot of things that we take in our stride (and I am regularly \'guilty\' of) are utterly horrifying to a lot of Westerners, however, I have had quite a few Western friends tell me that the ease at which Indians accommodate even the most insane things amazes them.3. Colours.Indians are bright, bold and dazzling. While women flaunt every colour recognised by the human eye, the men are not left behind as well. We splash colours throughOur clothesOur foodyes, that\'s blue.Our artOur moviesOur GodsOur housesOur festivalsand the list goes on.Many non-Indians I met found that overwhelming at first, but it did not take them much time to adjust, and then grow fond of our zest for colours. An active interest in the beauty of the world, combined with a zeal to live life to the fullest, they said.4. Hospitality.If there is one thing Indians take seriously, that is "Atithi devo bhav". Across religions and regions, one thing that really binds Indians is their treatment of guests. For a non-Indian, it can get awkward and over-bearing, but for Indians, guests and their comfort are of prime importance. Many non-Indian friends of mine who have stayed with us or other Indian families have appreciated, time and again, the warm hospitality they receive. Even after they have returned home, every time the topic of their trip comes up, they never fail to mention the hospitality as one of their fondest memories. Indian hosts, they say, are great at breaking ice, establishing closeness and informality, and making the guest feel like a family member, while spoiling him to the fullest with attention, curiosity, companionship, warmth and enthusiasm. Indeed, many of them want to visit again.5. Curiosity.Many non-Indians are struck by the fact that Indians are genuinely curious about other cultures, customs, histories and countries. Indians who travel abroad or come in contact with non-Indians come across as a curious lot, keen to explore or at least be informed about other parts of the world, while the lesser privileged back home make the point clear by bestowing unabashed stares on anyone or anything looking \'unIndian\', whether in reel or real life. Be it plain curiosity or a hidden agenda, Indians never cease wondering about how things are across the planet. Many non-Indians I know, especially Americans, marvel at the curiosity and the enthusiasm through which Indians look at the world.'

S' "Overrated" is your perception, so I won\'t go by that, but I can definitely share a thought or two about why he garners so much attention, involvement, and support among common folk - i.e. through the layman lens of viewing the Mahabharata.The soft corner for Karna begins with his birth - when his mother abandons him as an innocent, helpless baby in the clutches of a mighty river which had every chance of killing him. Coupled with the fact that he is the illustrious child of the Sun (an extremely revered entity in Hindu philosophy, religion and mythology), Karna sets the perfect stage for a mixture of awe and tender sympathy right with his first breath of life. He is then taken up by a humble charioteer in the service of the king of Hastinapur and his wife, and this prince grows as an extraordinary boy in ordinary surroundings, unaware of his identity... just how many stories do we have which run on similar lines? It is a classic case that appeals to our mindset.Karna grows along with the Kauravas, and commands their respect, and Duryodhan\'s friendship due to his virtues and inherent qualities. He is that hard working, brilliant, self-made but underprivileged boy whom everyone admires. He is dedicated to his peers, and believes in responding with gratitude whatever attention and appreciation he gets. He is a great believer in friendship, willing to go out of the way for it, and is sentimental about his people. He is a hero with a heart.And then there are stories splattered across Karna\'s dynamic life - stories of valour and love, of loss and mental strength, of disillusion and steadfastness, of his famed generosity and supreme ability to sacrifice, of his biggest strength and weakness of being extraordinarily simple and human in a sea of complex, conniving and grey characters. Karna appeals to the common Indian mindset for all of these and most importantly, because he matches exactly what we all wish to be.Over years, the grey scale of the Mahabharata has been played down, and characters have been largely singled out to be so good/bad that the common public no longer relates to them. It either places them on a pedestal, or dumps them altogether, but pretty much none of the characters gets them so involved. Karna appeals to people\'s emotions; his tragedy pulls heartstrings, his sacrifices awe us, his generosity and friendship make us yearn for a friend like him and to be like him, and his final defeat on the battlefield leave us with a loss, a sense of helplessness and fiery respect for the great warrior and man he ultimately developed into.Delve into our popular culture - movies, books, tales, plays, songs - and observe the hero\'s qualities; I would be surprised if you cannot relate them to Karna. Karna has seeped into our consciousness as the embodiment of an extraordinary yet accessible, divine yet human, rock-solid yet sentimental figure that everyone aspires to be, yet few actually can.Karna appeals because he is unique, but more so because he resides, at least as a wish, in each one of us.'

Consequent goodbyes. Skype calls. Birthday emails. Give and take of advice and ideas.Age 24 - "Is he the one?"Being raised by an Indian father is a roller coaster ride. It is to see a perfectly logical, rational man turn into an emotional, irrational being in less than a second. It is to be spoilt by a man who can scare the shit out of you with one raised eyebrow. It is to see a tight-lipped, hard-faced man who did not cry at his father\'s funeral trying to hold back tears when he says goodbye to you at the airport. It is to see a man who raised you \'like a boy\' to suddenly look suspiciously at all boys who might have glanced a second time at \'his girl\'. It is to see a man who pushed you to be \'independent\' all your life to be extremely unsettled to see your individualistic approach in your adult life, especially in your marriage. It is, in short, to be raised by a bundle of contradictions and explosive emotions, one you never understand, but are attached to, anyway.There is no one way to describe how an Indian father raises his children. He grows and learns and changes with them. His gamut of emotions is manifest in the emotions he evokes in his children, at times reassuring them of certainty, at times confusing them with his own contradictions. He loves, argues, defends and disowns passionately, and it is that passion which is the undercurrent of everything he does for, and expects from his children. Being raised by an Indian father - despite differing values, situations, rewards, punishments and attitudes - is being raised with a passion which evolves with you.'

How will they solve them? What are the issues they have already tackled or are tackling? How did they do it/are they doing it? In addition, they should also be tested for their understanding of politics, psychology, futuristic studies, environment, decision-making skills, and mental health.I am sure a country which can come up with the most lengthy (and comprehensive) Constitution of the world can come up with such customised tests for selecting their governments and legislators."

S' To help people, to show others they are smart, and a lot more. A lot of people write because they genuinely want to share.

We go seeking lessons, solutions, entertainment, solace, controversy, affirmation, debate and drama in real life, as well as on Quora. Those who write are simply responding to our search.Some write because they enjoy the sheer act of writing; some write because that is the way they can express themselves best; some write to impress; some write (especially on specific topics) to stay in touch with their interests; some write to improve their language and writing skills.

S" Most answers here have covered almost all factors that cause Indians to break traffic rules. Many of them are actually within the individual's control, while many are due to social, peer and institutional forces. There are two factors, however, which I feel are hugely at work and not been adequately considered. They are -The tendency to 'fix it' (modifiable at the individual level)The inconvenience of commuting/travelling in India (largely out of individual's control)The average Indian routine is multi-dimensional, spread out, and chaotic. That is largely because it is packed with people, events, failure and repetition of many daily tasks (due to inefficient systems and inadequate infrastructure), infrastructural struggles, limited/inefficient technology, and an inherent lack of management understanding. We rarely get time to sit and plan our days, tasks and priorities consciously and systematically; most of the time, we are on the run, juggling everything on the way, mostly getting things done as and when they directly stare into our face and block out everything else. With little time, resources and focus to work on things diligently, we just go about fixing them as and when they break down.A similar thing happens when we commute. We know we have to be some place at some time. Many a times, we also know how much traffic we would have to encounter and how long it would take to go there. Yet, since we already have our hands full fixing other stuff, we simply do not have the time to sit and plan all our tasks in such a way that we get that exact time frame to make the commute and reach in time. So, a) we are either late, orb) we break the traffic rules - signals, speed limits, one-way signs etc. - and make it on time.Following traffic rules do not allow us to 'fix' hence we break them.Further, commuting in India is one nerve-wrecking task. Indian cities and towns have hardly heard of urban planning; they have simply grown like a wild nettle bush. There is little logic to how roads appear, turn and blend into each other. Many of them are narrow and in extremely bad shape. To top it all, they are now packed with cars that grow larger and larger in size and number (making them seem narrower than ever), and they can no longer sustain the ever-growing traffic which comprises of a chaotic motley of all sorts of vehicles, hawkers, people and animals.Wading through this chaos is difficult, stressful and time consuming, and the added woe are ill-designed traffic rules. Roads turned into one-ways are often those on which are heavily packed with traffic. Too many traffic signals on one main road are frustrating - you stop at one, you stop at all. U-turns not allowed, meaning you have to go four blocks further just to go one block back from your original position. A street full of shops and restaurant has no parking space, meaning you have to park by the road side, and make the road more congested, or park at some faraway spot and walk down all the way. Driving in one lane consistently isn't easy, because you never know when you will come across a pothole or a dog or a hawker, and you will have to swerve instantly into the lane beside you, disturbing all the vehicles in your vicinity.And added to it, the lack of patience or time, because we have exhausted it all in fixing other things of our daily life.This leads us to finding our own solutions - even if they be illegal or downright wrong or harmful. For someone who knows how the regular Indian runs his life, breaking traffic rules shouldn't be a surprise. It is simply a manifestation of our tendency to fix things by doing whatever is in our control, rather than taking the systematic, albeit long-ish route of doing things in an orderly way."

S" The best thing about an Economics degree is that it gives you a lot of choice. The worst thing is that the choices are too many.The obvious choices for you are data crunching in MNCs, teaching and banking and finance. You will not find it hard to get a job, and you will earn well. However, if these do not interest you, and you are not set upon one particular goal, then it can be confusing, because then you will be possessing quite a few important skills which a lot of people need, but with no clue as to where you would enjoy/gain from applying them. One such field that really requires your skills is that of development. Yes, the subject of Development Economics rings a bell here, doesn't it? With your degree in Economics, you could work on a number of issues which directly affect millions of people on the planet. You could work with population, children, women, refugees, health and hygiene, water and sanitation, community development, environment, agriculture, education, growth and employment, sustainability - you name it.A good Economics degree would arm you with the tools and the thought process that would enable you to work comfortably and efficiently in most of these areas. The average pay isn't extraordinary, but with the right opportunities, you can definitely do well financially.This field is largely dominated by NGOs, but many MNCs are also involved through their CSR programmes. You could also work with governments and international organisations like the World Bank and the UN. If you are someone who is sensitive about human welfare and development, this is your chance to do something about it. It is a field which is not much sought after - an average Economics graduate would want to be a banker more than an agricultural economist with an NGO for instance - and a conscious decision to step into this field would mean you choose to positively impact the lives of the masses every single day. Using your degree to leave the world a better place? Not such a bad idea."

S" The best way to kill loneliness is to be comfortable being with yourself.Sure, you could join groups and activities to meet people, but it gets exhausting after a while, especially if you seem to be the one continually putting in efforts with other people. It is a harsh fact that people are drawn more naturally towards 'people' people, and unless you are an easy extrovert thrown into unfortunate, circumstantial loneliness, you will find it very difficult to draw people towards you. I would still suggest keeping people in the loop, but instead of focusing on them excessively, focus on yourself. Explore your mind, and surprise it regularly with new information, activities and ideas. Keep it busy, challenge it, pamper it, exhaust it. At the same time, give it a break, and the strength to listen to itself - most of us do not really let our thoughts roam our brains loud and clear, because we fear confronting them in totality, and all alone. We are in a denial mode about so many things. The fears, the lies we convince ourselves to believe, the criticism, the awkwardness and awe of some truly beautiful compliments you have ever received - they are all lurking in the corner of our minds which we regularly shut off by engaging it with other people, things and actions. Perhaps you could open that up by doing absolutely nothing with absolutely no one, and then you would not be lonely at all."

S' Firstly, I am a bit sceptical about using characters from the Mahabharata for discussing Good/Bad/Evil, largely because it is extremely difficult to classify them into any one category. They all have their share of virtues and vices, and thus any black and white inferences/conclusions would be not only woefully adequate but also rather unhelpful and even misleading.Bringing the question in a general perspective - yes, being bad and evil can have certain benefits in the short term. "Bad" and "evil" are rather vague terms and can encompass a lot of actions, but I will limit my interpretation to causing harm, direct or indirect, mental or physical or otherwise, to another being out of purely non-defense and selfish motives for the sake of simplicity in this answer.Being bad/evil to achieve one\'s goals is nothing new, and that is precisely because it is a time-tested technique. It takes people aback, weakens/destroys them and whatever hurdles they place in your way, and makes it considerably easier to achieve goals in the present, and thanks to the consequent reputation, in the future as well. It makes it easier for you to aspire for more, to achieve more, and to keep going, because you have little to no issues about how much you are stepping on, on the way. The chances that you become more of a result-oriented person rather than a process-oriented person increase if you are bad, evil, and ruthless, and you are a great addition to anyone with ambition, and the same moral compass as you.Of course, all this glory lasts for a short while, because these qualities are neither lauded nor upheld in society, and you risk drawing ire, hatred, punishment and even threat to your well being from most people around you. It has a huge degrading effect on you as a person, and if you believe in the karma theory, then boy, you are screwed.Yet, as just one of the species and a part of this ecosystem, is it really extraordinarily wrong to act in purely in one\'s selfish interests? Is it really going to have the repercussions we imagine when we name those actions as \'sins\'? These are points to ponder upon.'

S" Ishita Roy and Bala Senthil Kumar have given great answers, but I cannot resist answering even though my answer is on similar lines.In a single word, yes. Feminism directly challenges traditional family roles of women in the Indian society. It stands for everything family roles do not - individualism, independence, equality, self-responsibility, sexual empowerment to begin with - and directly contradicts what young girls and women are taught and generally expected to be.Feminism is a threat because it 'allow's women to simply use their brains. That means these women will think - a dangerous thing if you do not want your thoughts, principles and commands to be challenged. A society with a family structure which has so rigidly decided to have a say on even the most private aspects of its individuals' (women's) lives will never, never find compatibility with a concept which basically allows everyone to 'mind their own business'.In that sense, feminism also serves as a challenge to men's traditional roles in the Indian family. It strips off their dominance and power, but it opens up at least three avenues - of individualism, freedom of choice and sexual empowerment - for them. I realise men have traditionally experienced all three more than women historically, but they have been only relatively better off, and have had their share of issues as well."

S' The principal reason for widespread anaemia among Indian girls is poor dietary habits. Girls naturally need more iron, and it is important that they take active efforts to increase and maintain their haemoglobin levels. An effective diet is vital in doing so.A large portion of the Indian population is vegetarian, which means they do not eat meat, fish and eggs, which are rich in iron and proteins. While vegetarian diet too can be iron and protein rich, there is little to no effort taken in including the relevant foodstuffs in daily diet. Anaemia is more common among rural girls than urban ones, and one important reason is socio-cultural discrimination. Even today, girls are neglected in the face of their male siblings; their diet and nutrition, just like their education, assume secondary status in a typical rural Indian household. The health of young married women, pregnant women, and young mothers is also not given priority, especially if they do not produce male heirs. This is not immediately obvious, especially to urban observers, but a very important obstacle in tackling anaemia among Indian women.'

Also, this version of culture has a history and a set of reasons which neither he nor his counterparts are fully aware of.It is also the reflection of a mindset which is slow to change and accept - do not be fooled by their comfort levels with education ("oh, but they are all so educated!") and technology; fundamental changes in one\'s lookout towards people, freedoms, responsibilities and life concepts are more influenced by experiences, time and wisdom than formal education and technological access.

The \'modern\' section of the Indian society is increasingly disillusioned with a distorted concept of secularism, often confusing it with bashing/lack of respect for Hinduism with an irrationally soft corner for religions which actually force/induce conversions. This section, though a minority, is also the one which is the most educated, and wielding power over most resources within the country, ensuring that their voices prevail over all. The majority is faceless and cannot do much about it, at least for now.With such a background, a concept which does not "fit in" with the values of this modern section cannot be seen comfortably as making waves. It cannot hope to garner their acceptance, let alone support, and it should very well except scathing criticism from all corners.The problem with ghar wapsi is the whole brouhaha it allows to surround it, while proponents of other, more rigid religions continue their work of systematic conversions with low profile. Supporters of ghar wapsi do not realise that making it an emotional, explosive and widely publicised issue is not going to help in any way. Ghar wapsi has a lot to learn from other organised religions. It clearly isn\'t. That\'s what\'s wrong with it.'

S' I am very, very fortunate to be surrounded by people whom I can describe as exceptionally intelligent. They enrich my life greatly, and have made me a permanent admirer and seeker of intelligence. I have also been fortunate enough to see their lives closely, as they have opened up to me, directly or indirectly, and given me important glimpses of their lives.The best part about being intelligent is that it enriches lives, their own as well as those who are close to them. Of course, if it is harnessed in the most optimum and wise manner, which these people have. They have managed to conserve and efficiently utilise all possible resources within their reach, including the most precious - time, to glean the best of what their life has to offer. They have made the best they could of every object, opportunity, concept, situation and person in their life. Being intelligent has also made them attractive to those like me. Their knowledge, their analysis, their ability to see what no one does, the depth of their understanding is addictive, and it never ceases to amaze and intrigue me. I find myself, just like many find themselves, drawn to such people, for they ignite a never-ending fire in our minds, and feed it with their intelligence. Coupled with humility and firm grounding, this intelligence is impossible to resist.Yet, there are some downsides as well. If intelligence is not coveted, it is intimidating. Hell, even if it is, it can still be intimidating, at least in the initial stages. People who intimidate others with their intelligence, howsoever unintentionally, end up with relatively more difficulty in establishing emotionally close relationships sustainably. They definitely gain respect and even admiration, but personal comfort levels are challenging to establish as others end up viewing them as somehow superior to the rest. Many of those who are intelligent too find it difficult to establish, manage and sustain strong relationships/ties with the majority, as their unique abilities make them stand out; indeed, you are rather alone if you are at the top. It is not out of spite or arrogance at all, but intelligent people tend to be choosy about the company they keep, as they are aware of who can contribute what to their lives. This often conflicts with their emotional needs, and it is a long struggle for most exceptionally intelligent people unless they completely transform their personalities and gain the necessary skills to attract multiple strong relationships, or accept that they would always share a rapport with a customised and slim selection of people.Contrary to question details, I have assumed intelligence to be beyond "really good in studies", though I am sure these points would apply more or less to those who are academically brilliant as well.'

S' I will try to answer this question with the story of a woman who completed her PhD recently.She was by no means privileged, but she had dreams which few women from her generation could relate to. She wanted to do a PhD long back, but the humdrum and duties of daily life neither allowed her nor motivated her to take that step. She was daughter-in-law to a struggling household, wife to an ailing husband, and mother to a young boy, while working as a professor in a nearby college. PhD went on the back burner.She finally did take it up. True, she had been in touch with her subject due to her profession. She was quite intelligent, well-read, with good language and writing skills. But she was not a genius.Also, she was 55. Which meant that she had spent most of her life without the technologies we youngsters so take for granted, and had to grow comfortable with them overnight. Which also meant that along with her PhD, she had work commitments and home commitments. Which also meant that she didn\'t have the advantage of energy, swiftness and flexibility we young students possess but are rarely aware of.She signed up anyway. Her guide seemed to be brilliant, but he did not seem to grasp the genuine obstacles that came with her age and profile. As time passed, it became clear that she could expect neither support nor empathy, and that she was on her own. She ploughed through.Her son completed his education and started working. His girlfriend did too, and he asked her hand in marriage. These were crucial times, and suddenly, a marriage was on the cards. Work commitments continued to persist and increase. Health issues cropped up, and age took its toll. And to top it all, the system and her guide posed quite a challenge.She did not stop. Sure, she panicked, stressed, lost hope, met with dead ends, and wanted to give it up. But she did not stop. Four days before she retired, she was awarded the PhD.This woman is my mother-in-law.Her difficult journey taught me a lot about the nit and grit of doing a PhD, and only made my resolve stronger. Salient points I learnt were - 1. Being a genius is not a requirement; it is a bonus. You do need to be intelligent, and equally importantly, you need to have a sound, solid foundation. My mother-in-law floundered with margins in MS-Word and macros in MS-Excel, but her research and analysis were flawless.2. You need to have focus. And not the "one lecture and I am done!" focus, but the "I will stay focused as long as it takes" focus. She had that. With the million responsibilities and milestones middle-age brings, she never lost sight of that PhD.3. Yet, you need to be flexible with priorities. No, she did not lock herself in a room all five years, but she shut off everything else (including the kitchen) when she studied and worked on her PhD. Of course, it wasn\'t smooth. She might not have been perfect, but she divided her time pretty well. She taught me that life doesn\'t stop, and that just because PhD stretches long, you cannot procrastinate forever - both in the same breath. 4. You need to believe in it, and truly love it. Frankly, a PhD wasn\'t going to sky-rocket her career, as she was retiring. She had had a long career, and wanted to retire on time and in peace. Except for some pension benefits, a PhD technically served no purpose. Yet, she persevered and put in 100% in each and every task related to her PhD (down to the last full stop) right till the end. She stayed faithful to her subject, her work, and her deadlines. She really felt for the topic/issue she had chosen and genuinely wanted to address it. It was not a degree, it was her mission. Her conscience was motivated. If this would not be the case, I am fairly certain all the pressures would have gotten the better of her......As I take baby steps towards my PhD, I realise I am no genius either. Intelligent and articulate, yes, but clearly not a genius. Yet, I have an extraordinary example in front of me, which shifts my focus from being a genius to inculcating aspects like a strong foundation, focus, flexibility, and deep belief in my subject of choice within my character before I embark on the journey. I hope her story helps you take further steps as well.'

I do not know if Syrian refugees are approaching China (please let me know if and how you have come across any such information). I have doubts though, whether China would be a good place for refugee rehabilitation. The country is already over-populated, its resources are stressed beyond measure - I read somewhere that 80% of its cities are already water stressed, and it is already suffering from unrest, especially in its western Xinjiang province. China is also not a free, democratic country, and running from a Syrian dictatorship into a Chinese dictatorship is like, well... more or less the same thing.Also, China is not particularly known for being inclusive of diverse cultures, which can be seen from its own history; how it systematically 'blended in' all the diverse cultures, languages, communities etc. into one identity. Muslims in Xinjiang province are clearly not comfortable as a minority group. This can be reason enough for Syrian refugees to avoid opting for China, where the chances of preserving and practising their own culture are pretty bleak, as their host country. If you are forced to abandon every bit of your motherland, perhaps forever, you would want to go to a place which gives you more freedom and space, and a better life wouldn't you?

S' Is there a war? A race? A match? I don\'t see how modernisation and Indian culture are at loggerheads. In fact, if anything else, Indian culture is flexible enough to take modernisation in its stride, and it has been doing so, slowly, steadily, a bit haphazardly and illogically, but certainly. Indian culture is based on philosophies and spiritual/religious values which are flexible, and which can run as undercurrents through history and future as society changes and moulds itself. This is because these philosophies and values do not engage primarily with daily life - they deal with the fundamentalism of our existence, our purpose, our conscience and our actions. They do not provide a "DOs and DON\'Ts" list; they do not tell us to fear some entity. They address concepts which can be fit, debated and investigated in a universal context.

S" I read this question just after I read an article in the news which spoke about how the Arab World was not stepping up to help their brethren, so I do not agree with your statement that no one is pointing fingers at them.Also, right since 2011, countries like Jordan and Lebanon (both Arab) have been taking in refugees right since the outset of the war. Earlier, they took in Iraqi refugees as well. And 0h, Palestinian refugees before that. Today, about 25% of Lebanon's population (a freakishly tiny country) is refugee. That doesn't make news for most of the world though.Truth to tell, there is no one solution to the migrant crisis. Also, the whole situation is extremely complex and as a novice in the field, the more I dig in, the more it overwhelms me. I am sorry, I have no concrete solution.It is easy to take a position on whether European countries should accept the migrants, especially when you are rooted rock solid in your point of view. For instance, human rights activists have it crystal clear - they should be taken in and rehabilitated. Then there are those who firmly believe in the economic lens - that the burden of refugees on their economy will do them no good, and it should not be theirs to bear. The religious angle is sceptical of the change migrants will bring, and anti-Islamists will stress on the possible spread of Islamic fundamentalism.All of these make sense when views them through just that one angle, but bring all aspects into picture and its a mess - and no one answer. European countries have their own problems which are not conducive to acceptance of refugees, yet they cannot just shut their doors on the face of fellow human beings. As to why Arab countries are not being questioned, well most of them are either in no condition to accept refugees (Yemen and Iraq for example), or hold enough clout to refuse refugees point blank. It is true that they should be roped in, though.The refugees are not an 'Arab' responsibility, they are a global responsibility. Countries which turn them away for short term problems and goals risk creating resentment and more fundamentalism. Countries which actually take them in are faced with the additional tasks of convincing the host population and putting in extra efforts -social, economic, political, cultural- to make sure that the refugees gel in with the society in order to prevent future social tensions. Countries like Lebanon and Jordan which are already creaking under the immense weight of refugees need to be helped with the burden. Every solution comes with its own set of problems, and I feel helpless as I cannot provide a viable solution, after all this rambling, after all."

It is extremely tricky to impart values without sounding preachy, and balancing that act is vital.Greatness begins at home.No, you don't have to be the richest, most intelligent, most powerful guy on earth for your children to find you extraordinary. They will find you extraordinary when you actually personify values and ideas which are unique and path breaking. These values and ideas need not rock humanity, but by making positive, meaningful differences in the lives of individuals around you, one at a time, you can set examples for your kids to observe and learn from.If you can manage these three points decently enough, the chances that your children will grow up with a strong but balanced combination of responsibility, ambition and character increase considerably. It is vital that your dreams are not levied upon them, and that they always, always have the option of not being obliged to leave back a legacy, your love for them remaining unaffected. It is also vital that you do not lose sight of their humanness while inspiring them to be extraordinary. Children, after all, they say, are not a tree to be grown. They are a fire to be lit and kindled. Light and nurture them."

S" I'll try to answer this with my own example.I got married at a very, very beautiful beach in a small, picturesque Maharashtrian village named Anjarle. The sun was out, the breeze was lovely, the sea clean and blue. Guests were few but fun, and food was delicious.do you spot the sea?To be honest, the idea of getting married at Anjarle was a decision which was not very popular at the beginning. It raised a lot of eyebrows and arguments, and if it weren't for my husband's determination, I would have found it extremely difficult to convince a whole bunch of people to let us tie the knot there.Why Anjarle? There are a bunch of reasons, several of them extremely personal, but then so is marriage. Many of these reasons you might not connect with them, but the ones that appeal to you - they can help you determine where you want to take your first step into a life of love and companionship.1. Go back to your roots.Not mine, but definitely my husband's. My husband's maternal grandfather was born and grew up in this village before he left for Pune for education and Vidarbha for his career. My husband has childhood memories of this place, and it holds a special tug at his heart. It is also located in his native region Konkan (as he is a Konkanastha), and means a lot to him culturally.Legacy, history, cultural roots are considered laughable and irrelevant things today. But dig a bit deep and you will find a connection you cannot resist. We did that, and it led us to Anjarle.2. Go back to nature.We are no wildlife enthusiasts or environmental activists, but we love trees, flowers, clean air, sun, sand, and sea. We absolutely adore the red soil of Konkan, the banana and coconut plantations, and the way small paths meander and end abruptly in the Arabian sea. Opting for the Vedic rituals of marriage, we also looked to include the five elements of nature - the panchamahabhutas - in our wedding. The open sky (akash), the clean air (vayu), the holy yajna (agni), the sea (jal), and the red soil of Anjarle (prithvi) were direct participants in the ceremony.The philosophical bit apart, simply going back to clean air, the sea roaring in the distance, the birds twittering on trees, the sweet smell of acacia nuts and bananas, the quiet sunshine pouring through plantations, and the slowing down of time can do wonders. Crowded marriage halls overflowing with gaudy lights and noise, overlooking gutters and traffic jams, and smelling of smoke and pollution hold no merit in front of nature's beauty.3. Go back to people.Ever winced at the overflowing crowds at marriages and the forced smiles in front of the camera? We did, and we wanted to avoid those. So we simply invited people who made us smile. The advantage of the venue was that it couldn't hold too many people, and that made us think hard about all the people in our life and prioritize. Turned it, they prioritized us as well, and readily put in 16 hours of travel to a rural place with no complaints. They helped with the ceremony, they danced and sang and laughed, they loved eating at the beach, and now, about 8 months later, they still remember our wedding and the venue with a wide smile. Weddings in India are never about individuals, they are about family and friends. Isn't it time then that our weddings made them happy?4. Go back to simplicity.Our combined cost of the wedding (yes, we documented pretty much every penny spent) is not even half of what just one party would spend. Hell, the combined cost of all our wedding costumes would barely buy a saree in a mainstream Indian wedding (yes, I am actually happy that my wedding saree is not at all expensive). We spent instead on the comfort of our friends and family, on food, and on helping the local economy - and we did not spend much.The wedding was no grand affair, but it was comfortable and fun, and a big reason for that was the venue. It was so inexpensive! Wedding facilities in city charge us wayyyy higher than necessary, and most facilities are grossly overpriced. I am aware that it is a symbol of prosperity to 'show' how much you can spend on your saree or the jewellery or the food, but frankly, we don't care much about it. The important part is to get good returns for every penny spent.5. Go back to food - your food.Being the foodies we are, the most important part of the wedding (any wedding) for us is food. It was extremely important to us to have purely Marathi food, cooked by Marathis, served the Marathi way. We were tired of the paneer makhanwalas and biryanis served at Marathi weddings, and even though we love Punjabi food (and Punjabis), we are just... not Punjabis.We Indians are fortunate to inherit such a stunning culinary culture, and while pizzas and pastas are always welcome, exploring one's local and historical food is an experience indescribable in words. It can only be relished and lived and relived. And what better occasion than a wedding to do that?So yes, that's it - we got married at a place which gave us a beautiful blend of our five coveted aspects - roots, nature, people, simplicity, and food. We could have hunted and found more similar places, but this one just appealed to us instantly. When it comes to matters of the heart, we felt, the heart is the best judge, after all.I am sure you know a place which preserves your roots in its memory. Which is naturally beautiful and simple, and which calms your mind. Which welcomes your loved ones with grace and affection, and stays in their mind long after you are married. Which is kind to your pocket, and generous to your palate.You do, don't you? Get married there."

S' Most of my generation first heard of Canada due to Celine Dion, the singer of "My Heart Will Go On". We thought she was American, but hey, she turned out to be from - what? Kanedda. In India, Canada (or to be precise, Kanedda) is that lesser-known, less controversial, colder cousin of the USA (or to be precise, Amayreeka) heavily preferred by Indian (read Punjabi) population to migrate to. And oh, the word Kanedda is to be always, always said with a follow up of Punjabi sounding drum beats in the mind...sort of the dhink chik taak chik, dhink chik taak chik kind.Canada for Indians is the good, quiet cousin of USA which seldom appears in the news. They do not declare unpleasant wars across the globe, they do not have random gun firing in the streets, and they do not have Hollywood. But they have tons and tons of us, and many in the emerging upper middle class can name some acquaintance settled in Kanedda (oye hoye!).Q&A Jokes such as "What is the capital of Kanedda? Chandigarh!", "What is the national food of Kanedda? Paneer!" abound since the Sikhs and other Punjabis form a considerable portion of the Canadian community. Other Indian communities too thrive in the country, and largely report being happy and comfortable being a Kaneddian. They say that you can be a Canada and still retain your culture, identity and religion, which is not always possible in the \'melting pot\' of America, and that makes Canada a favourite destination for most Indians.Except the cold. Canadian winters are dreaded by we Indians who are used to enjoying plenty of mildness in our winters (except the northerners, but then, North Indian winter is still mild compared to Canadian winter). The snow is attractive, at least for the newbies or those who have never been to Kanedda or seen snow in their life. That\'s where the talk of Kanedda v. Florida or Texas or California begins. That\'s just armchair talk though, we like Kanedda for its cleanliness and natural beauty, its combination of opportunities and a quiet life, and of course, the fast track visas.Kanedda!!

S' "at least on Independence Day"? I wonder what that is supposed to mean. Do you mean to imply that we should put up a mask to "save face" on a day that is a landmark in our history?Our advertisements do not showcase dark-skinned Indians because, face it, that\'s not what we want to see. We - yes, all of us - are so programmed to expect performers and models, especially those on TV, to be \'good looking\', that anyone who does not fit that criteria is instantly viewed with a raised eyebrow.Yes, there are caveats.It is true that Indians, largely, the young generation, has begun to slowly overcome the "white is beautiful" mindset. Darker skin is gaining some footage, and the value associated with defining and accepting beauty beyond skin colour is on the rise. However, the mainstream definition of beauty is yet to change, and it still equates good looks with fair skin.It is equally true that the society is more and more accepting of realism in various media, and that acceptance also extends to those working in it. However, the first instinct is always to spot the physical beauty of the model/actor/celebrity in question, and then, by conscious understanding, we mould our thinking to accept the person as he/she appears, and recognize that alternative definitions of beauty exist. Commercial companies are not drivers of social change; they can only choose to be, and any that does so would be an exception, not the rule. The intention behind advertising is to make sure that their product appeals to the mainstream, i.e. the majority of the population, and hence, whatever is good for them is good for the company\'s product. Companies are genuinely not interested in sacrificing the mainstream profit-generating majority for a sliver of offbeat, liberal, intellectual thinkers. At the very least, they are quite clear and frank about it. Better than indulging in lies and hypocrisy by showcasing dark skin on a national holiday.'

S' It\'s a combination of luck and attitude. I don\'t want to minimize the luck part. I was lucky in several ways: first, I was one of those nerdy kids who couldn\'t get a girlfriend. I didn\'t really date anyone until I was in my mid 20s and I didn\'t get married until I was almost 30. If you\'d called me lucky back when I was a dateless wonder, I would have called you crazy. And had I been more attractive to women, I probably would have gotten married earlier--before I\'d been able to handle it. There certainly are folks who married young, made it work, and are still together, but I\'m pretty sure my marriage wouldn\'t have lasted if I\'d met my wife before I was 25 or so. Even if I\'d met the same women, it probably would have failed. I simply wasn\'t mature enough back then. I was a mess until was 26 or 27.By the time we met, many aspects of my life had fallen into place. I knew what I wanted to do for a living. I had some skills I was confident about. I\'d lived on my own and knew how to pay bills, cook dinner, etc. I was done with my rebellious stage. I was trustworthy. I was hard working. The same was true of my wife--and the same hadn\'t been true about her a few years earlier, when she was in her early 20s. I wish I could say I was smart enough to wait until I was mature enough for marriage, but that would be a lie. Life made me wait until I was mature enough. I will say, though, that many of the dateless nerds I know--the ones who married relatively late--have had successful marriages for similar reasons. You look at them now and think, "These guys and gals are solid. They knew what they want. They know how to get it. Their youthful egos have melted away. They\'re kind. They\'re loyal..." They\'re marriage material! They probably weren\'t when they were 22. Think about what\'s going on in most people\'s lives when they\'re in their late teens and early 20s. They\'re usually in the thralls of a complicated, fraught relationship with their parents; they haven\'t figured out what they want to do for a living; they have little experience living on their own; they don\'t yet know where they want to live... Trying to wade through all that and be in a serious relationship at the same time is tough. Another way being older helped: I didn\'t marry any of those good-looking girls who caught my eye--girls I had nothing in common with except physical attraction. My wife is gorgeous, but it wasn\'t her face or body that won me over. I got lucky in terms of meeting someone really compatible with me. We have similar values, practically the same sense of humor, similar interests, etc. It took me many years to meet someone like that, and, luckily, the women I met earlier--the ones I wasn\'t so compatible with--turned me down. I would have settled. The attitude part has to do with a strong belief in marriage. By which I mean two things: (1) I take my marriage vows really seriously. I promised to stay with my wife until death and I meant it. To me, marriage was never about "let\'s try it out and see what happens." I have never had one foot out the door--not even one toe. And (2) I am willing to do what it takes to make the marriage work. I don\'t expect it to be easy. I don\'t take it for granted. I think of my marriage as a creature that needs care and tending. I feed it every day. I look for signs of problems. This is more important than the first point! It\'s great to feel a sense of commitment, but I really know how to solve--or at least how to begin to solve--some problems. I know how to talk to my partner about problems. I know how to listen. I am willing to compromise. I am willing to seek outside help if necessary. If we had a big problem we couldn\'t solve, I wouldn\'t even spend a second "considering" couples therapy. I\'d be on the Internet, looking for good therapists. There are hypothetical deal-breakers. If my wife started beating me and refused to stop, I\'d leave her. If she continually lied to me, I\'d probably leave her, too. But, in general, ending the marriage simply isn\'t on the table. It\'s not something I keep in mind as an option. Marital problems are problems to be solved. I think of them the same way I think of food problems. If I was starving, I wouldn\'t say, "Well, maybe I\'ll just quit eating..." I\'d find food. I\'d steal it if I had to! Early on in our marriage, we had a talk about what would happen if one of us had an affair. I said to my wife, "Well, if it was an ongoing thing and you were in love with the other guy, that would be a problem. But if, say, you got drunk and had an \'accident,\' I think we\'d get past it. I\'d be very, very angry. But if you\'d be willing to work on fixing the problem, I\'d work on it with you." She said she felt the same way. I don\'t think all marriages should be like that--that they should try to work through anything. But I\'m saddened by the number of married folks who work through nothing. They don\'t see marriage as a thing you work on. They don\'t consider couples counseling when things go wrong. Sometimes, this is because they don\'t expect anything to go wrong. When it (inevitably) happens--in what they thought was happily-ever-after--they\'re totally blindsided. This was another area when marrying older helped. I didn\'t have those sorts of illusions. I knew long-term relationships take work. Here, I have to return to luck, again. Marriages don\'t work when only one partner is devoted to solving problems. Luckily, my wife is as devoted to it as I am. She wants the marriage to work; I do, too. (I am probably making it sound like it\'s this horrible monster we have to tame every day. It\'s not. We\'re best friends and we mostly have fun together. But in a 22-year relationship, there are bound to be ups and downs.)We both agree that there\'s no such thing as "her problem." There\'s no such thing as "my problem." Even if it\'s clear that, by some objective measure, only one of us is at fault--e.g. I blow $10,000 of our saving at a casino--we look on it as a problem with the corporation. It\'s a problem we both have to solve, together. If she blew the $10,000, I\'d be furious, and I\'d let her know that, but I wouldn\'t say, "Shape up." I wouldn\'t make it all about her, even if I\'d done nothing to cause the problem. If there\'s a problem, it\'s our problem. Here\'s the final way we got lucky: our parents. My wife\'s mom and dad, now both gone, were happily married for over 50 years. Mine are still alive and still together. They got married in 1962. Their relationship was rockier than my in-laws\' was. When I was 14, they split up for nearly a year. Then, they did a lot of hard work, got back together, and stayed together ever after. So both my wife and I grew up seeing marriage as something lasting. I was traumatized by my parents\' split when I was young, but I now see it as really valuable. I watched two grownups work out their problems and stay together. In my experience, many folks whose parents got divorced don\'t really believe in marriage. They don\'t believe it can work. They\'re aways expecting it to fail, and they often push it to failure, so at least they\'ll have some control over what they see as inevitable. I know marriage can fail. But I also know, from evidence I saw with my own eyes, that it can work! (And if I ever got married again, I would only marry someone else who believed they can work, too.)Here are some behaviors we engage in that are crucial to keeping our marriage afloat and fun: 1. Communicate. Sometimes people complain about how they woke up one day to discover their spouse was a stranger. What that means is that days, weeks, months, years ... went by when they weren\'t talking--or when they weren\'t talking about important stuff. People change, but they don\'t change overnight. The stranger in bed next to you started becoming a stranger two years ago. You didn\'t know, because you and he didn\'t talk about it. My wife and I talk about everything. And I mean everything. We talk about feelings of attraction outside the marriage; we talk about our fears; we talk about our irritations; we even talk about our bowel movements. There\'s no such thing as TMI in our marriage. I guess we give up some mystery, but we gain a ton of intimacy. I\'ve come to realize that it\'s important that we talk things out immediately. If I suddenly realized I was bisexual and really needed to experience sex with a man, I would be terrified to tell me wife. But I wouldn\'t put it off until next week (or next month or next year). I would take a deep breath and tell her immediately. Right now. Holding that stuff in for even a short time is toxic. It\'s going to come out somehow, anyway. Even if I successfully hide part of myself from her, it will come out as anger, nervousness, depression, or stress-based illnesses. It will rot the marriage. Maybe the marriage can\'t withstand the truth, but it definitely can\'t withstand lies. So the truth must out. Now! 2. Play together. I don\'t mean Monopoly or catch. I mean that every day we get into tickle fights, giggle like lunatics, turn household items into puppets, etc. We are totally used to looking absurd around each other. We have no shame. We are totally free to roll around in the mud together. 3. Work on big projects together. We co-run a theatre company. At the moment, it\'s dormant, and so we\'re taking sewing classes together. We each have some individual interests that the other one doesn\'t share, but there\'s never a day when we don\'t spend at least some time talking about shared projects. These are fun and interesting things we do together--not household chores we do through gritted teeth. (Though, of course, we do those, too.)I\'m saddened by how many couples don\'t work together--except when they have to. If it turned out that my wife and I had no common interests, we\'d invent one. I\'d say, "You\'re not into archery; I\'m not either. Let\'s take an archery class together!" Humans form tight bonds by working on common projects. I sometimes fantasize about being a marriage counselor. People would come to see me and say, "Our problem is that ..." And I\'d say, "Shut up! Go into that room and don\'t come out until you\'ve built a playing-card tower together that touches the ceiling!"4. Ignore everyone else. Our marriage is the most important relationship in our lives. We both feel that way. You know the old puzzler? If the ship was sinking and you could only save your wife or your mother, who would you save? Well, I love my mom, but I\'m in a partnership with my wife. She always comes first! If she didn\'t, there\'d be no point to the marriage as far as I\'m concerned. My mom wouldn\'t do this, but if she ever made a mean-spirited comment about my wife--or tried to come between us--I would instantly and definitely put a stop to her. "I love you, mom, but you need to stop saying stuff like that or we won\'t be seeing each other any more." And this would be a three-strikes-and-you\'re-out situation. My wife knows this. She knows she comes first with me. I know I come first with her. And no one\'s opinion of our marriage matters. Someone thinks I could have done better? That\'s his business. Someone thinks I\'m dragging my wife down? That\'s her business. We didn\'t get married to impress other people; we didn\'t get married to rebel; we have nothing to prove. We\'re simply best friends.'

S' Are you asking when women stop looking like the "hot chicks" you see in movies? If so, we should start by noting that most women don\'t look like them to begin with. Here\'s the best answer I can give you: if we show people photos of 1,000 women--each of whom is displayed at various stages of her life--and demand that all the viewers classify when the women changed from being "hot chicks" to an "old ladies," refusing to let viewers use any other categories, my guess is that we\'d get a range from about 35 and 60, depending on the individual woman. It\'s impossible to be more specific, because people age at very different rates, and even two people aging at the same rate often look wildly different from each other, due to genetic differences, dietary differences, and so on. My friends (male and female) are mostly in their 40s, 50s, and 60s, and it\'s amazing how varied they look. Some of the 60-year-olds look younger than some of the 40 year olds. I have friends from high school who still look pretty much like they did back then, 35 years ago. I have others who look elderly. And I have many whose looks are somewhere between those extremes.Answers also will depend on the age of the viewer. Many folks in their teens and early 20s think 40-year-olds look like old people.

Rather, people who happen to have positive feelings about, say, mating, tend to have more children than people who don't. And they pass their positive feelings on to their many children."

If you're asking about some magic scenario in which, somehow, dinosaurs continued to exist in a world with humans, we'd almost certainly have wiped they out long ago, as we've done with most large animals.

S' Because sight is more complex than we tend to think. Seeing an apple isn\'t something you just do with your eyes. Your eyes capture certain data, but by the time you become conscious of the apple, its image is enhanced or tarnished by all sorts of other data. If a perfect-looking apple smells bad, it will probably look less-than perfect to you. If I tell you it\'s actually a fake apple, and that it\'s made out of wax stuffed with fecal matter, it will look worse still. If you have a standard human brain, you won\'t just think, "It looks delicious, but it\'s actually disgusting." It will start to look disgusting to you. If it\'s a real (non-rotten) apple, and your best friend gave it to you, it will look better to you (and probably taste better) than an identical apple from the store. Many owners of a Picasso painting will like it less if they discover it\'s a forgery, even if they initially loved it for its colors and shapes, not because it was painted by a famous artist. Nothing intrinsic to a painting changes after you discover it\'s a fake. The way something looks is a creation of your brain, not your eyes. Sight plays a role, but the final result is a composite--and it\'s not stable. If you one day find out that the man you like is a pedophile, he may stop being attractive to you, even though his looks won\'t have changed. You won\'t see him as a good-looking child molester; you won\'t see him as an average-looking one, either. You\'ll see him as an ugly one. Looks matter to most of us, but mostly as a default. Our experiences and knowledge of a person change our first impressions.'

S' It\'s incoherent. Everything is natural. It\'s impossible for us to create matter out of nothing, so everything we make is made out of ingredients from nature. If you define "unnatural" as "altered by humans," then a carrot is unnatural as soon as you dig it up. Carrots in the wild don\'t dig themselves up. Perhaps "natural" means "something we haven\'t altered very much." In which case you have to avoid all domesticated plants and animals. Pears are unnatural, brussel sprouts are unnatural, cows are unnatural, chickens are unnatural. These are all life forms we\'ve hugely altered through centuries of selective breeding. (Is a beaver\'s dam unnatural? After all, the beaver built it. It\'s an artifact. Or is it natural because something built by an animal is natural? If so, then a helicopter is natural, because it too was built by an animal--in this case a primate.)There are some "natural" things--things untouched by human hands--that you can experience if you want. You can, for instance, wait until lightning catches a forest on fire and then go running naked through the flames. You can go swimming in the arctic ocean. You can tease a cobra until it bites you...The truth is that various substances affect our bodies in various ways. Some "natural" substances help us; some "natural" substances harm us; many "natural" substances help us in some ways and harm us in others; some "unnatural" substances help us; others harm us; and many others do both.'

S' Many of us hate to lose. Many of us also hate to be in a tie. We only feel good when we win. And what matters, emotionally, is how each person subjectively defined winning. (The amount one hates to lose--and loves to win--is often rooted in early childhood. There may even be a genetic component to it. Which is to say that if someone is trying to beat you, it\'s probably a continuation of a conflict that\'s been playing out in his head for years. You are a proxy for daddy, the cool kids in high school, "those people," or whatever. If you can be easily tagged--Christian, atheist, conservative, lesbian, woman, etc--you will attract bullies who feel the need to fight with "them.") So if I\'ve framed an interaction with you as a fight, argument, or competition, I will want to win it. Note that the same conversation might not be competitive as far as you\'re concerned, but my actions are based on my context, not yours. Even if you\'ve never criticized me, I may be (from my point of view) in a fight with you, because you said something that made me feel stupid. Or you remind me of someone who made me feel stupid. (If I say, "I hate comic books," some folks will hear, "People who like comic books are stupid." So even if you\'re not trying to belittle anyone, someone may wind up feeling belittled just because you\'ve expressed an opinion. This is more-likely to happen if he\'s been humiliated in the past.)It really sucks to let that go unaddressed. What stops me from trying to beat you over and over is impulse control. It\'s the same thing that stops me from drinking too much wine, hitting on lots of women, blowing all my money at the casino, and leaving restaurants without paying. I have instincts to do all those things, but my frontal lobes say, "There will be a price to pay if you do." On Quora, common prices stalkers pay are seeming childish to others, seeming dangerous to others, losing the possibility of friendship with others, not learning from criticism, getting kicked off the site, and feeling guilty. When the "you must win at all costs" voice enters my head, the "don\'t be a dick" voice follows and usually dominates my consciousness. I\'m lucky* in that I have strong impulse control. Some people don\'t. They and I both have the "you must win" voice. They simply don\'t have the brakes on it that I do. (Some folks naturally have control, but they browse the web drunk. Alcohol famously blunts our breaks.)I\'ve never purposefully antagonized anyone on Quora. That is, I\'ve never gone into an interaction with that goal. I\'ve certainly said thing I knew would likely upset people, e.g. expressed views on religion, parenting, etc., but never with the goal of upsetting anyone. So I haven\'t experienced anyone stalking me in retaliation for me constantly badmouthing him.But I have experienced it when I\'ve refused to let another person win. That\'s most-often what the stalker wants--a win. I\'ll post something that upsets him, and he\'ll try to win by using logic or, more often, by making a short, cutting quip. Quips don\'t affect me, and if I agree with the guy\'s logic, I\'ll generally say, "You\'re right." But if I don\'t, I won\'t. Most of what I discuss on Quora is stuff I\'ve been studying for years or even decades. I don\'t believe I\'m infallible, and, in fact, people here have changed my mind about stuff I thought I knew well, but it\'s not likely to happen via a quick "logical" argument, because over the last 30 years, I\'ve probably heard that argument hundreds of times before. So here\'s what happens: Me: Our school system is bad because .... [blah blah blah]Someone: I think you\'re forgetting ... [blah]Me: No. I covered that in my third paragraph. If you go back and read ...Let\'s say the other person really wanted to win with his first remark. He wanted (or needed) me to say, "Ah, you\'re right. I did forget about that." He was feeling a little irritated with me from the beginning. Now, the tension is building and I haven\'t given him a release.Someone: You know, people like you always say ... [blah blah blah]Me: Other people may say that, but I haven\'t, and I wouldn\'t, because I don\'t agree with it. In fact, what I said was ... [blah blah blah]Someone: Uh huh. And I suppose you know everything about the subject, because ...Here, he wants me to respond to his tone. He\'s hoping that I\'ll match sarcasm with sarcasm, because he knows that though he may not have the upper hand when it comes to logic, he\'s really talented at snark. If we get into a snark war, he\'ll probably win.Me: I can see why you suppose that, but you\'re wrong. It\'s true that some people with my view also think [blah], but I don\'t. My stance is exactly what I wrote, above. That and only that.Someone: Ah! A classic back-peddle. Congratulations. You must be proud of your hypocrisy! Me: When did I back-peddle.Someone: You claimed [blah]. Now you\'re claiming [blah blah].Me: No. If you read my fourth paragraph, you\'ll see that I\'ve claimed [blah blah] all along. Where in my post do you see me claiming [blah] or anything like it?Nothing has helped the other guy with his goal of winning. The longer I respond calmly, the more upset he gets. The more upset he gets, the more he needs to win. It\'s like he came in needing his ego topped up a little, but each further interaction drained his tank a bit more. Now it\'s almost empty and he\'s desperate. I won\'t give him points for logic; I won\'t play his sarcasm game. Eventually, he\'ll cut his losses and say ...Someone: You know, I have better things to do that waste my time talking to someone as close-minded as you...He\'ll feel a little bit better for getting a dig in as the last word. But he\'ll still have a gaping wound to staunch. I\'ve made it sound as if my behavior caused that wound to worsen, and maybe it did. But in the case of some stalkers, the wound happened years before we ran into each other. I just remind him of whoever originally hurt his feelings. This is often the case with men who stalk women. Each new victim reminds him of some woman (or some group of women) who hurt him--or who he believes hurt him--in the past. You, some new woman, are hurting him just by existing--or by refusing to let him dominate or humiliate you. He\'s a walking wound, and he\'s going to keep trying to heal himself by winning. In any case, the guy above may feel he can refill his ego tank by engaging me at other times. Yes, he may have lost the battle, but that doesn\'t mean he has to lose the war. He\'ll obsessively pour over my posts, looking for a weak spot. If one weak spot fails to work, he\'ll try another. He\'ll keep trying until he wins or totally loses, maybe by being kicked off the site. He\'ll either do that, in which case I\'ll have a stalker on my hands, or he\'ll move on to some other proxy--someone with the same opinions as me (or similar ones) who is more of a pushover. He will keep probing for weaknesses in me and others. His ego is at stake!* There are downsides to strong impulse control. I never seem to have quite as much fun as my super-impulsive friends. I get myself into fewer fights and messes than they do, but their lives are more exciting than mine.'

Some men enjoy the ego boost they get from knowing multiple women will sleep with them; others are addicted to "the chase" and get bored when a relationship gets too settled; some love variety; some want to connect with another person in ways (possibly but not necessarily sexual) they feel they can\'t connect with their wives; some want to get caught--usually because they are scared of intimacy and the longer their marriages endure, the more certain they are they\'ll end; and some are angry at their wives and want to get even; some just want lots and lots of sex, possibly with more than one person.

S' In my country (and in many other countries), no one is locked into marriage. People (a) choose to get married, and (b) choose to stay married. For an American (German, Swede, etc) to claim he\'s locked into marriage is a shocking refusal to take responsibility. It\'s like me claiming I\'m forced to work at my high-stress, corporate job. No, I\'m not. I am "forced" to work there if I want to have an apartment in New York City and a huge TV. Also, Nature doesn\'t "advice" us to flirt around. Nature isn\'t sentient. It gives no advice. Rather, people are born with various impulses. Some of which are counter-balanced by other impulses (instinctual and/or learned). Nature seems to have "advised" me to to steal things. Just last week, I was at a friend\'s house, and I saw this big wad of cash on his dresser. I had a really strong impulse to take it, and that impulse felt completely natural. Gaining resources adds to my chance of survival and reproduction, and in our society, money is a resource. But I curbed my instinct. Sometimes, when I\'m on the subway platform, and it\'s super crowded and noisy, I have a natural impulse for more space (our ancestors--with whom we share a brain structure--did not evolve in crowded cities, and we\'re not optimized to live in them), and I felt the urge to push people onto the tracks. I didn\'t do it. I am not saying it\'s wise to throttle all our impulses. I\'m saying "it\'s natural" is a weak argument for doing or not doing something. We have natural impulses that are great; we have others that are not-so-great. We have many that are great in some situations and not-so-great in others.There\'s lots of evidence to suggest that we have (at least) two impulses when it comes to coupling, both of which are equally natural. One is to play the field and the other is to pair bond. There is nothing strange about us having conflicting impulses. Humans and other animals have them all the time. It may be irritating, but we aren\'t optimized for happiness. Having conflicting impulses is a core trait of our species. Often, conflicting impulses wage a tug of war that creates a kind of stability. Being too loyal might have decreased our ancestors\' chances of reproduction; being too promiscuous might have blunted their mating chances, too. Each person--and each couple--finds its own way to cope with conflicting impulses. (Throttling, cheating, fantasizing, divorcing, allowing...) It\'s not the case that all married couples cease flirting. Nor is it the case that flirting causes disharmony in all marriages. I am not much of a flirt, but that\'s because I\'m introverted in general. My wife is a party girl who flirts with everybody. It\'s not a problem for her or for me. We\'ve been happily married for 20 years. Some couples go further than we do and have open marriages. (They\'re more common than it seems, because the people involved tend to keep that aspect of their lives private.)'

S' Man derives from a proto-germanic word, which meant "person," not "male person." When Old English snatched the world, its meaning became more restrictive, but it still retained its original meaning as an alternative definition, e.g. "the dawn of man." Wikipedia suggests ...The spelling of woman in English has progressed over the past millennium from wfmann[1] to wmmann to wumman, and finally, the modern spelling woman.[2] In Old English,wfmann meant "female human", whereas wr meant "male human". Mann or monn had a gender-neutral meaning of "human", corresponding to Modern English "person" or "someone"; however, subsequent to the Norman Conquest, man began to be used more in reference to "male human", and by the late 13th century had begun to eclipse usage of the older term wr.[3] The medial labial consonants f and m in wfmann coalesced into the modern form "woman", while the initial element, which meant "female", underwent semantic narrowing to the sense of a married woman ("wife"). It is a popular misconception that the term "woman" is etymologically connected with "womb", which is from a separate Old English word, wambe meaning "stomach" (of male or female;"Male" and "female" are more tenuously linked, despite their similar sounds and spelling. "Male" derives from the Latin word "masculus," whereas "female" derives from "femella," also Latin. "fe" is not a prefix tacked onto the beginning of male.'

S' Well, there are tricky things about it for people who come to it other languages that are very different from Javascript. Javascript is object-oriented, but it uses a different kind of object-orientation than most other popular languages, such as C++, Java, and PHP. If you\'re used to the more-common form, you\'ll be confused by the JavaScript way. I actually think JavaScript\'s approach is simpler (or at least no more difficult) for someone who learns it as his first programming language (or as his first object-oriented programming language), but for JavaScript-as-second-language folks, it can be a brainfuck. The same is true for it\'s functional aspects. The first language I learned* was LISP, which is a functional language, so the idea of first-class functions, pure functions, and immutability weren\'t odd or difficult for me when I encountered them in JavaScript. But to someone who has never done functional programming before, there will be a learning curve, especially if he\'s spent a lot of time coding in non-functional languages. It\'s relatively easy to learn metric if it\'s your first measurement system. It\'s much harder if you\'ve grown up with inches, feet, and pounds. The only truly difficult thing about Javascript, in my opinion, is its relative lack of community standards and standard libraries. There are often ten ways of doing the same thing, and if you ask ten JavaScript developers to tell you the best way, you\'ll get ten different answers**. This is true for many languages, but there tends to be more agreement--in, say, the Java and Python communities--about best tools and practices. This is all relative. Two Python programmers may well have profound disagreements, but it tends to happen much more often in the Javascript community. This is because JavaScript hasn\'t been taken seriously for much as-long-as most other popular languages. It\'s been around for years, but only a few as a language that interested professionals. So the situation is a little like English in Shakespeare\'s day, before spelling and grammar rules had been standardized. (Shakespeare spelled his own name in several ways!)Practiced JavaScript developers tend to love this flexibility. Ask me how to create instances of objects, and I can show you a whole bunch of different ways. And I love the variety, because I can pick whatever method I think best suits a task, but that\'s a bit overwhelming for newbies. When I was starting out, I often wanted to scream, "Just tell me the right way to do it!"There\'s another tricky thing "about" JavaScript. I put scare quotes around "about," because this isn\'t really a tricky thing about the language itself. The problem is the ecosystem it exists in. The same is true for most languages. Want to learn Python? I mean really learn it, so you can get a job as a Python developer? If so, learning the language itself will be the easy part. Or at least the short part. It will take you much longer to learn Python best practices, Python IDEs, key Python libraries, etc.Most people want to learn JavaScript for web development. If they\'re new to web programming, they get discouraged--and I don\'t blame them--when they realize the language itself wont get them very far. To be productive, they also need to learn common libraries and frameworks like JQuery, Underscore, Angular, Backbone, Ember, and React. (A professional JavaScript developer should have at least some familiarity with all of them!)They also needs to understand tooling, e.g. build systems, such as Grunt, Gulp, and Webpack. They need to learn their way around an editor, such as Atom, Webstorm, or Sublime Text. They need to have some experience with the command line. They needs to know how to write and run unit tests. They needs to know how to use a version-control system (most-likely GIT). They needs to know HTML, CSS, and a CSS pre-processing language, such as LESS. They need to know server-side JavaScript at least well-enough to handle node and npm. And they need to be able to intelligently collaborate with server-side programmers, which means having some level of understanding of web protocols, databases, and so on. Finally, this is a confusing time to learn JavaScript, because many developers have started using ES6 (a.k.a ES2015), the latest version of the language, which is syntactically very different from past versions. Example: Here\'s an old-style Javascript function:1\n2\n3\nvar foo = function(num) { return num + 1;} Here\'s one way to write it in ES6:1\nlet foo = num => num + 1; Because we\'re in a transitional period, JavaScript books, courses, articles, and tutorials may use either format or a mixture of the two--as may source code a newbie has to read. So, unfortunately, this means you need to learn both syntaxes when you\'re first starting. Which is a bit like trying to learn Spanish and Portuguese at the same time. In a couple of years, everyone will be writing JavaScript the newer way, but we\'re not there yet. * After a brief acquaintanceship with BASIC. ** It\'s too early to say this with absolute confidence, but I\'ve seen more convergence of opinion in the JavaScript than ever before. It\'s centered around the React framework. There are definitely programmers who dislike it or prefer other solutions, but React is becoming very popular and influencing lots of other tools.'

S" Theoretical resolution of small objects is determined by Abbe diffraction limit. Basically, if a half-wavelength of light can't fit between two objects, you can't tell that they are separate. You won't be able to distinguish the peak of the wave from one from the peak of the wave from another; there is too much overlap.Actual eyesight is never limited by that. Actual eyesight is limited by the quality of the lens in your eye, how precisely you can focus it, and how close you can bring it to the lens while remaining in focus. That's well above the Abbe limit, in the range of about .1 millimeters (100,000 nanometers). The Abbe limit comes into play for microscopes, which can be bigger and better controlled than your eye; their limit is closer to 500 nanometers. Various techniques can be used to beat the Abbe limit with machinery, physics, and chemistry, but your eye will never come anywhere close."

S' Well... my reaction varies. I was a "Trekkie" when the term didn\'t have quite so many negative connotations, a time when Star Trek was three seasons and a cult classic. None of the other series have had nearly as much impact on me, not even Deep Space Nine, a show I found most interesting in ways that it had nothing to do with any of the other Trek shows. The thing that makes "Star Trek" special for me was a moment in time that can probably never be recaptured.I sure wouldn\'t mind if there was a completely new thing, the way Ron Moore (who had a heavy hand in Deep Space Nine) completely reinvinted Battlestar Galactica into a far more intersting thing than its original form could possibly have ever been. But that could happen with any series; there\'s no special reason it should come from Star Trek. Indeed, the sheer amount of Star Trek "canon" would make it even harder.That said... I\'m glad to see Trek back on the small screen. I don\'t think Trek was well suited to movies. Sure, it had its biggest single success on film... but largely because it had a huge basis to build from. Movies have to be about Big Things, and when Trek went to "God" as its Big Thing, it made some of its worst films. The best Trek film (by broad consensus) is about aging and friendship and loss, themes that worked because they had spent years building up those friendships to lose. When they tried isolating some of those elements for Into Darkness, they failed miserably, precisely because they didn\'t have the time to make the relationships count.So a well-built TV series is, for me, a much better idea than more movies. It has a better chance of tapping into the Trek spirit, of a very big universe filled with exciting ideas and new ways to look at ourselves. That doesn\'t guarantee success; as Voyager and Enterprise showed there are plenty of ways to do it wrong. But if it can manage to be even as successful as TNG, that would be a pretty big win for the sci-fi world. TNG is, I find, even more popular at Trek conventions than TOS is; it captured the zeitgeist of a different generation from mine. It has been decades since then, and Trek is a good universe in which to go looking for the feeling that captures people\'s imaginations now. It\'s even entirely possible that it can be a great show without appealing to me. So in the end, I just don\'t really have a reaction, other than to hope that they manage to do something good, same as I\'d feel about any story. I\'m afraid that Trek lost me at Voyager; I simply do not feel attached to its universe as a whole and I don\'t particularly feel like a new series automatically has to impact me one way or the other.'

S' It\'s a form of mis-generalization, not entirely different from the process that gives us "irregardless".English absorbs words from many different languages. Sometimes, it absorbs just the root and forms plurals in the regular way. Other times, it imports both the word and the plural, yielding irregular plurals.Some Greek words ending in "-is" form the plural by adding a vowel, "-eis". When filtered through American pronunciation, this becomes "eez". For example, the plural of "analysis" is "analyses", pronounced "analaseez". The same holds for "parentheses", "appendices", and "emphases". and There is also a similar Latin transformation that imports the plural of "matrix" as "matrices"For "process", we did not import the Latin plural along with the word (which would be "processus"). But the spelling "processes" resembles words like "analyses" and "matrices", and some people incorrectly infer a similar pronunciation rule. A similar mis-generalization affects "biases", from a French root.It\'s not "wrong", exactly. This is English, which is a mishmash of irregular forms and irregular pronunciations. "Standard English" is a consensus; when the consensus breaks down, the standard changes. "Processeez" is considered a nonstandard pronunciation by most dictionaries, presumably because that particular mis-generalization is restricted to certain areas. It would make sense (but I have no data) if it\'s more common among technical people who get more exposure to words with Greek roots. (Greek words in English tend to have a technical feel; they were imported primarily in academic contexts.) I\'m sure it\'ll prove yet another pet peeve among language prescriptivists because "being peeved" is what prescriptivists do. But actual dictionary makers are more interested in documenting what words (and pronunciations) catch people\'s ear rather than trying to hold back the ocean of language change.'

S' The first thoughts that came to my mind were variations on "eggs". There are already a couple of answers to that effect already, so I won\'t repeat them. But I will reinforce the idea: an egg is incredibly easy to cook, requires little equipment and practically no skill, and is very filling and nutritious. Keep a dozen eggs in your kitchen, plus some kind of fat to lubricate the pan, and a bit of salt, and you\'ve got several different meals right there that require little more technique than "make egg hot and stuff into face hole". Scramble it, fry it, boil it soft or hard... these are trivial things to do. You\'ll get better at them and produce better results, but even the lousy results are edible.So instead I will talk about pasta. Again, this is brain-damage simple:1. Put a lot of water in pot.2. Add some salt, about 2 teaspoons per quart. (Eyeballing this is just fine).3. Put put over heat.4. WHen it boils, put noodles in pot.5. Turn down heat if water starts to spill over. 6. Stir occasionally to keep things from sticking, every couple of minutes.7. Cook until the time listed on the box. (The instructions on the box are often aggravatingly hard to find. It\'s anywhere from three minutes for angel hair, to 15 minutes for really thick noodles.) 8. Taste it. When it\'s not-crunchy but still a little chewy, drain it in a collander. If not ready, cook more.9. Put anything that happens to be in your fridge on top of it. A jar of spaghetti sauce. Butter. Leftover Chinese food. Chili. A fried egg. Some chopped-up fresh tomatoes. A hamburger. Seriously, just about anything. If that thing is cold, nuke it a bit, or put the mess back in the pan over the heat and stir until it is hot.10. Stuff in face hole. Swallow. Repeat.This again is about the most versatile thing you will ever do. "A big bowl of starch" can be put under anything. (That starch can also be potatoes or rice or grits or lots of other things, and the basic recipe of "heat in water until it is cooked" applies.)For extra credit, you can actually start the noodles in the cold water. It works fine, and goes a bit faster. They tell you to start it in hot water to make the cooking time more consistent, but really, the goal is to recognize the difference between undercooked noodles and cooked noodles, which is best done with your eyes and your teeth. The main thing here: don\'t get worked up over "recipes". 90% of cooking is taking ingredients and making them hot. There are a few basic ways to make them hot: with direct heat from a pan, in a box full of hot air, in a bunch of water. As you get comfortable with these techniques you can optimize, but if you\'re in a position to be asking me for beginner recipes, the main lesson is "forget the recipes". Just figure out which hot-making techniques go with which basic foods.People get worked up over flavor combinations. Honestly, less is more. Let great chefs worry whether this dish needs a micron more fenugreek. Start with good ingredients, make them hot in the correct way, and let them taste like themselves. Noodles don\'t taste like much of anything, so they taste like whatever you put on top of them. If what\'s on top is a good thing, the dish is a good thing.'

S' I think that the best way to visualize the second law is via the notion of a Heat engine. A heat engine does work when energy flows from a hot place to a cold place.That asymmetry between hot and cold is the basis of a directionality in the universe. The totality of "hotness" in the universe relative to "coldness" is a quantity we can keep track of. That quantity is "entropy", and it can only increase. As the universe winds its way along, it goes from having more states with heat and cold widely separated, to having heat and cold distributed more equally. As a purely probabilistic matter, the universe is more likely to be in a state where heat can\'t transfer than a state where it can.If you could get work out of a heat engine with no losses, then you could run the process in reverse to create more hot and cold spots just by pumping in energy. If you could do that losslessly, you could reverse the entropy of the universe. And as we just said, that\'s unlikely: there are more ways for the universe to lack order (separation of hot and cold) than to be ordered.So any heat engine has a maximum efficiency, which is defined by the ratio of the temperatures between the cold and the hot. The colder your cold sink is, the more efficient it can be. If you had an infinite sink of absolute zero, you could be perfectly efficient. But you don\'t have access to an infinite cold sink. You have only the area around you, where even the cold things are at a few hundred degrees Kelvin.The universe as a whole may actually be perfectly efficient, as everything in the universe winds its way to its heat death. But right where we are, you\'re limited by the Cosmic microwave background, a 3K heat bath that surrounds everybody and everything, and that\'s the practical limit on how well you can do. Even that practical limit is unreachable on earth, where you\'re living a mere 8 light minutes from a star pumping out a lot of heat, and a body that has been storing up that heat for five billion years and come to a rough equilibrium. That will limit the efficiency of any heat engine you try to operate. Your cold sink will be around 300K, or perhaps 30-50 degrees colder if you seek out a really cold place. That\'s a long way from zero.'

We get a few passing notions to a remaking of the world, presumably at the end:But their joy in victory was diminished, for they returned without the Silmarils from Morgoth's crown, and they knew that those jewels could not be found or brought together again unless the world be broken and remade.for the history was incomplete and the circles of time not full-wrought when the vision was taken away. And some have said that the vision ceased ere the fulfillment of the Dominion of Men and the fading of the Firstborn; wherefore, though the Music is over all, the Valar have not seen as with sight the Later Ages or the ending of the WorldAnd there are similar ideas. So we know, more or less, that the world does come to an end, and it probably does have something to do with Morgoth:And thou, Melkor, wilt discover all the secret thoughts of thy mind, and wilt perceive that they are but a part of the whole and tributary to its glory... And thou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.There's no suggestion of a battle in which Turin returns to kill Morgoth. As far as the canon is concerned Turin is just another Man, dead and gone beyond the circles of the world. But it's a world that does end, and somewhere in there Morgoth will discover what it was all about."

S' The short answer to the question is "no": there is no Slavic influence on Tolkien\'s work. It just wasn\'t his area of interest or expertise.The question is incorrect in some of its assumptions. Welsh and Finnish were used as the phonological bases of some of his Elvish languages, but these aren\'t related to Anglo-Saxon at all. Tolkien himself liked using Anglo-Saxon root words and idioms when he could, and at one point imagined that his stories of Middle-earth were being told by a writer who spoke Old English. That writer listened to the stories of the Elves, who supposedly lived on the island that is now Britain, and those stories were to be a kind of reconstructed fairy tale of a pre-Saxon (and pre-Roman) culture of Elves. Their language was free of Anglo-Saxon influence, and in fact came down directly from the "gods" (after much phonological shift, another thing Tolkien was fascinated by). The Welsh and Finnish influences were inspiration to Tolkien, rather than to the characters in the story.The frame story of the Danish traveler speaking Old English vanished around the time Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings, and does not appear in the published works. Slavic is just right out; the Elvish languages wouldn\'t have shared even so much as a Proto-Indo-European root with them. To my knowledge Tolkien didn\'t even speak any Slavic languages, though as a philologist he was probably at least passingly familiar with them.Tolkien\'s story began from Norse and Scandinavian roots, though it evolved so far from them that they\'re practically unrecognizeable. The Finnish story of Kullervo is obvious in the story of Turin Turambar, but it wasn\'t a conscious attempt to create a pan-European myth. Rather, Tolkien was trying to create a distinctively English myth, occasionally trying to tie in bits of mostly-forgotten mythos (like Wayland the Smith) and weave them into the story. Kullervo was an earlier fascination for Tolkien that was later woven in, much as he wove in Tom Bombadil and even Hobbits from other projects he was working on. By the time he was finished, even the "myth for England" largely disappeared as he created his own world.'

Some say Shakespeare was himself, in fact. But there's no connection between Shakespeare and any of the plotters, and in fact the rebellion didn't really have much to do with Catholicism.

S' Among physicists, the answer is "neither one". General relativity and quantum mechanics have differing views of time, but neither one of them is usefully classed as either "real" or an illusion. In both, guided by special relativity, time is inextricably linked to space; the portion of "spacetime" as time and which is space is determined by relative motion. Relativistic quantum mechanics preserves this via Lorentz invariance. Fully handling accelerating frames requires a curved spacetime, via general relativity, with a different metric.As for what philosophers accept... honestly, who gives a flying fuck what philosophers think of time? The physics part is demonstrably more valid, and has been for a century at this point. A philosopher\'s pre-relativistic, pre-quantum view of time is as relevant as the humors theory of medicine. McTaggart had the excuse of writing in 1908, but the idea that modern physics treats time as an "illusion" is absurd. Time is in the equations, to which experiments adhere to a dozen decimal places; whether that\'s "real" or an "illusion" is a matter of semantics, not science. The human conception of time might be an "illusion", as a function of humans perceiving things... but that\'s a matter of neurology, not physics. And if the philosophers are as outdated about their neurology as they are about physics, their opinions remain equally worthless.'

S' A movie doesn\'t need a message. In fact, it probably shouldn\'t have one. Tolkien explicitly disavowed having one in The Lord of the Rings:As for any inner meaning or \'message\', it has in the intention of the author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical.Films are there to entertain. The Lord of the Rings and 300 do so in very different ways. I\'d say that they actually have practically nothing to do with each other. If there is some trope that\'s common to the two of them ("sacrifice"), it\'s something they have in common with thousands of other films. The same tropes come up over and over because they are entertaining. It\'s not a "message" you need to hear from either film, since it\'s one you\'ve already heard. Rather, it\'s a theme that\'s interesting to hear about, and it can be dressed up in wildly varying guises. Different forms will appeal to different people, and that\'s just fine. If you don\'t like 300, don\'t go see it. It\'s not the filmmaker\'s job to tell you what to see. It\'s the job of the movie reviewer, and I thought they did a pretty good job of telling me what to expect from 300. (I didn\'t expect to like it... and I didn\'t. I\'m not even sure why I went.

The basic level of required calculus should not be difficult for anybody with the kind of rigorous, mathematical thinking required for computer science. It\'s also a prerequisite for basic college-level science classes like physics and chemistry. So you\'re not taking calculus as part of CS. You\'re taking calculus as part of a general STEM-oriented general requirement for a Bachelor of Science degree.

S' The field of "philosophy" has diversified. A lot of things that used to be called "philosophy" are given other names: economics, psychology, even science and politics. Two hundred years ago, anybody who is now a TV pundit might have been called a philosopher. So would Stephen Hawking. So, for that matter, would Deepak Chopra, which is actually kinda the point. When any piece of crap can be "philosophy", people tend to go looking for the particlar domains that are less crap-ridden.When people say "philosophy" they usually mean "metaphysics". But really, I\'m not sure that metaphysics ever got all that much recognition. You can probably name, what, less than a dozen metaphysicists in the past couple of thousand years? There have been lots more, but they made little mark at the time, and are remembered today primarily only by other philosophers.The other thing often called "philosophy" is "ethics", or more generally, the how-to-live-your-life branch of philosophy. There are actually a great many people doing that. They just don\'t call themselves "philosophers", and they don\'t get academic degrees in it because... well, because that would be a lot of work for not a whole lot of payoff. There are some ethics professors who get some radio airtime (like Peter Singer), or meaning-of-life philosophers like David Chalmers (whose work I consider a vapid pile of drivel and a stain on academic philosophy).So there are lots of philosophers. It\'s just that the famous ones aren\'t called philosophers. There\'s actually some very good work being done, in an incremental way that doesn\'t attract much attention.

S' The "observer effect" in quantum physics is generally confused with the Uncertainty principle, which is a more rigorous and better-defined idea.The "observer effect" is a classical notion that you have to interact with something to get data out of it, and that that interaction will of necessity have some kind of effect. Often, the effect is small enough to ignore, though on quantum scales it\'s it\'s hard to make something "small enough to ignore". Neutrinos don\'t particularly help you achieve that goal, because the size of their rest mass isn\'t particularly relevant. They carry far more energy than that; the rest mass is so small a fraction of it that we\'ve never managed to measure it. We only know that it exists at all because massless particles can\'t change their type like that, but all that tells us is that the mass is non-zero.The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is different from the observer effect. The uncertainty in momentum and position are fundamental, not properties of the observation. That is, it\'s not just that the measurement disturbs the particle (although it does). It\'s that the momentum and position are literally not well defined; they exist as a range. Via interaction you can narrow one down, at the cost of increasing the uncertainty in the other, but both will retain some uncertainty. That interaction is not necessarily an "observation".That minimum uncertainty is a fundamental constant of the universe. No matter how small your probes are, you can\'t circumvent them. Even if they could, neutrinos are poor choices for it, because they don\'t interact with things very much. It\'s incredibly hard to observe neutrinos; the overwhelming majority of them pass right through the entire earth.'

S' It\'s effectively impossible to predict. Climate change affects whole ecosystems, involving a vast web of organisms: plants, animals, insects, bacteria. Each organism will be affected in its own way: later flowering, earlier migration, different metabolic requirements, altered soil bacteria mix. It\'s an insanely complex feedback system. Each individual organism\'s response to the change in temperature is likely to be fairly small. It might move its range a few miles, or a few meters in altitude. It might change its schedule by a few days. But that affects the other organisms which rely on them for food, for pollination, for keeping populations in check, for breeding grounds, etc. Species they depend on may not be there, or in different numbers; species they\'d like to avoid (due to disease, predation, competition) may move in. There may be droughts, fires, etc. at rates different from previous. These effects will be far larger than the species\' own response to the changed temperatures, and those will in turn cause more changes elsewhere in the chain, feeding back on themselves.Some ecosystems may substantially collapse, and species go extinct. Others will become bigger, smaller, faster, slower, less or more energetic, etc etc etc. These are the same kinds of changes that have been present throughout history, but they\'re going to occur considerably faster (over a century or so, rather than millennia or longer), which is going to put a lot of pressure on them to react. And the ones that go extinct will put even more pressure on the ones that relied on them through the Rube Goldberg chain of dependence.So the actual adaptations directly to climate change are going to be far smaller than the total evolution that occurs. It will probably be difficult to trace any specific change definitively to "climate change": the time frame will be relatively short and big changes take a long time even in response to substantial pressures. The main changes will be in the interactions between animals rather than in their individual genomes. And the most common genome adaptation will be to simply die out.'

S" Yes, though only because people eat so much refined sugar. You can get cavities equally well from unrefined sugars, from natural sugars in fruits, and even from starches (which are turned into sugar in your mouth by enzymes in your saliva). But it's relatively rare these days for people to eat just those things and not refined sugars, so that's the main cause of their cavities. If they ditched the sugars they'd get fewer cavities, but not zero, since the other foods also feed the bacteria that produce the cavity-causing acids.Proper brushing with a fluoride toothpaste will dramatically reduce cavities. (Fluoride is also present in the water in many countries, which has contributed to an overall dramatic reduction in the cavity rate.)"

For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.Basically it means, "Yeah, you think it sucks, but there\'s a Plan. Really. Trust me." Which is largely the Catholic theodicy that appears throughout Tolkien\'s work. You have to have Faith. Not just "faith" that you have reason that things will work out (in Elvish "amdir", from manuscripts not published during his lifetime), but Faith that things will work out despite a very good reason to think that they won\'t (Elvish "Estel", which is familiar as Aragorn\'s nickname). Tolkien was big on "eucastastrophe", "the sudden happy turn in a story which pierces you with a joy that brings tears". He used the term mostly to describe stories, but he\'s also talking about religious faith: The Birth of Christ is the eucatastrophe of Man\'s history. It\'s the undeserved salvation granted by God.None of this makes a lot of sense to somebody who doesn\'t already believe... which is kind of the point by definition. The argument at that point becomes as much epistemological as theological; there\'s reasoning around an idea that specifically calls for no reason.

The problem is with non-scientists dispensing advice that sounds scientificky. Journalists aren\'t scientists. Anybody who writes ", PhD" after their name on a book cover isn\'t a scientist. (Take a look at a book by, say, Stephen Hawking. Note the way he doesn\'t say "Stephen Hawking, PhD"? That\'s because he\'s an actual scientist, and is recognized as such by other actual scientists who know that a PhD is the bare minimum qualification in the field, not a badge of general expertise. Frequently, the guys who write "PhD" after their names on book covers have a PhD in an unrelated field.) If the advice comes down to "Eat more veggies and less crap", then it\'s scientific advice. The rest of actual work on nutrition is trying to fill in the details, which cover a lot of baffling issues that nobody understands very well, sure as hell not enough to say "Eating X diet is going to fix all of your problems". Most real detailed work by nutritionists is for people who have very specific issues and need special help; you\'d need to see one to get specific advice. Preferably, one recommended by an actual doctor, not some quack who laid out a shingle. And the odds are the doctor will say, "So, did you start with the \'eating less crap\' part? No? Then go do that first."The tl;dr is that there isn\'t nearly as much "current scientific advice" as you might think. The vast majority of what\'s passed off as "scientific advice" is crap. It\'s not "crap that\'s going to be debunked some day". I mean just plain crap, and any actual nutrition scientist would tell you that from the first day. So if what you think is "current scientific dietary advice" comes from journalists and cranks, then no, it\'s not any better than it used to be.

S' Nothing. At least, nothing that\'s not also wrong with "natural" flavors.Artificial flavors tend to be purer, which makes the flavor less complex. Sometimes, that can be useful: in some applications artificial vanilla works better than natural vanilla because it carries the primary vanilla note more clearly.There\'s nothing toxic about them. They are usually purer forms of flavors found in the natural world, chemically identical. There\'s nothing especially safe about the natural versions. Some natural flavors, like Coumarin, have been banned from food for being dangerous. Which is too bad; it\'s an excellent flavor, more vanilla-y than vanilla. It\'s only in large doses that it\'s dangerous; the synthetic version is used safely as a blood thinner, in controlled dosages. Both artificial and natural flavors are used within guidelines generally recognized as safe.Both natural and artificial flavors are used in highly processed foods, which should be limited in your diet, because they contain high concentrations of calories and low amounts of other nutrients. Using the natural flavors doesn\'t make those foods any more "natural"; they still tend to have things like concentrated sugars and starches, and industrially-grown meats with unbalanced fat ratios. You would probably be healthier eating more "whole", unprocessed foods... and neither natural nor artificial flavors contribute to that.Consumers have a distaste for the "artificial" label, and food processors generally seek out the "natural" ones, but it\'s not really helping. Sometimes it does help the food taste better, by providing more complex tastes, but it\'s not improving the nutrition.'

Suppose you have an electron whose state you want to send somewhere else. And suppose you have a pair of entangled particles; call them A and B.You can use A to take a measurement of the electron. That yields you some result that you can write down and send (by email, carrier pigeon, FedEx, etc.) That destroys the quantum state of the electron. (The electron is still there, but you've forever lost whatever quantum state it had.)Now, you can take B (which is entangled with A), and interact it with some other electron somewhere else. To do that, you need to know the result of that measurement, in order to know what kind of interaction you need. (To oversimplify: you need to know something about B, which you learned during the interaction with A). Now the electron is a perfect copy of the original electron, without having to send it.But that doesn't really sound like teleportation to me. No mass or energy has been moved, just some quantum information. You had to get particle B there somehow, as well as the information you emailed/fexed/pigeoned. These are purely classical operations. It would have been far, far easier just to mail your electron.It's interesting in that you didn't have to mail the electron, just the entangled particles (which could be photons). But you still haven't really sent anywhere near enough to make an actual object, which is going to be on the order of 10^25 times more complicated. It's really hard to express just how big that number is. It's the age of the universe in nanoseconds, if that helps. And since all you've sent is a single particle, you haven't sent even a whole atom, much less the kinds of relationships between atoms.So it's not clear if it's even meaningful to talk about scaling this up to objects even as big as a molecule, much less an object. It certainly isn't like breaking down somebody into particles and then beaming the particles somewhere to be reassembled; the one thing you're explicitly NOT doing is sending the particles."

S" The Noldor didn't hinder Melkor's quest to rule Middle-earth. Before the Valar returned, he did control Middle-earth. Morgoth was kept bottled up for a few centuries after the Dagor Aglareb, but even that couldn't hold him all that long. All three Elven strongholds were destroyed. The one he couldn't destroy himself was destroyed for him by a combination of the Dwarves and the Noldor.The houses of Beor, Hador, and Haleth did some good work harassing Morgoth's troops, and if Thingol and Melian could have been convinced to help them, it's possible that they could have kept Morgoth at bay. Some of the greatest heroes of the first age were Men (Beren and Turin), and Luthien and Beleg were Sindar, not Noldor. Morgoth was always predisposed to cowardice. Despite his power he rarely showed his face. But his armies grew stronger all through the First Age, while Elves and Men seemed to roughly hold steady. Morgoth's dragons grew bigger, and eventually even flew. It's unlikely that the Eagles would have held them off.So I'd say the Noldor didn't really hinder Morgoth all that much. Perhaps Men and Sindar (and Eagles and Ents) would have stepped up; perhaps they would have been wiped out 500 years sooner than they were. But the true hope of Middle-earth lay in the West, and there was no chance of defeating Morgoth without them."

S' If the lottery is properly designed, then "no". The whole point of a properly designed lottery is that it pays out less than it takes in. If it were mathematically possible for one person to beat that, then other people could as well, and the lottery would lose money.It is possible to use math to determine if a lottery is improperly designed. That\'s what happened in the Cash WinFall lottery. It had a fairly complex system to ensure that it didn\'t take in too much money, and some weeks it would pay out more than it took in. If you can determine that, you can beat the lottery.A lottery game with a windfall for a knowing fewThe simpler the lottery is, the easier it is to ensure that it\'s correctly designed. So when you say "win the lottery", you\'re referring to some abstract "pick N random numbers" game. Lotteries publish odds, and it\'s fairly each to check that the payout is less than the odds of winning. That is, you might have a 1 in 10,000 chance of winning $5,000. You will lose that game, unless their random number generator is broken.That has been known to happen, but lotteries have staffs that check the ball machines (or whatever they\'re using). They can do the math as well as you can (better, probably) to check that the payouts are less than the ticket price. Screw-ups do happen, especially since real-world lotteries often have unnecessary complications (which are supposed to make the game more fun, but usually make the odds even worse for you). But there\'s no general mathematical tool for predicting the ways that people screw up. You have to look for it, and it\'s going to be so rare that it\'s probably more profitable to get a real job with your math skills.If you do want to play a random game where you\'re actually pitting your math skills against other players, you can try poker. But the odds are you\'re not the smartest person at the table. There is a sucker at every table, who you can profit from. But if you don\'t know who it is, it\'s you.'

S' Security is practically always antithetical to usability. Making it harder for thieves to get in nearly always makes it harder for authorized users to get in. In fact, much of the time, it makes things much harder for real users while making it only trivially more difficult for thieves. The nature of health care makes it necessary to share things. A lot of people are involved: the patient, their primary doctor, specialists, nurses, pharmacists, and an army of others who really just want to get the information they need so that they can treat the patient. That\'s before you get the insurance companies involved (who actually kinda don\'t want the patient to get treated, since they have to pay for it). These people have been making do with paper for decades. Paper is actually pretty good at keeping things secure, at least from hackers on the Internet. But it\'s really, really bad for sharing. They\'ve been developing individual software solutioins to try to cope with that, but integrating that software is hard enough without swapping around credentials (which starts with a really difficult challenge of just ensuring that "Patient Tom Jones" in system A is the same as "Patient Tom Jones" in system B... on down to system ZZ 9 plural Z alpha).Credit cards are comparatively trivial, since the only parties involved are you, the merchant, and the credit card company, sharing a very small amount of transaction information. And given how trivial the range of connections are, it\'s actually astonishing how incredibly shitty they are at security. In the US, at least, it\'s accomplished by pretending that some 16 digit code that you\'ve been handing around like candy is some kind of state secret.

The moment was quite affecting. However, I didn\'t care for the way it depicted Denethor as a gluttonous tyrant and a horrible father. Denethor is not a monster; he was in fact a wise ruler. His fault was in giving in to despair, a serious no-no in Catholicism and in Tolkien\'s world. I don\'t necessarily disapprove of changing the character from the book. This issue of faith is pretty abstruse, better handled in the contemplative nature of a book rather than the go-go-go nature of a film. Jackson also sought ways to cut the larger-than-life characters down to make the book more of an epic and less of a myth; that choice I am less sanguine about, but I understand it.But I think he went too far with Denethor, and I feel that that scene in particular suffered for it. It doesn\'t humanize Denethor to turn him into a cartoon villain. Instead of an opportunity to engender real grief for a human whose fault is very similar to our own, we feel contempt for Denethor. His death seems like comeuppance, a pretty shallow emotion. Jackson should have aimed for better. All he needed in that scene was to feel what we feel during that song, the heartbreak of a father and ruler who has just sent men to die in a necessary cause, helpless and forlorn. We would understand his despair, and instead of greeting his death with "Good", we\'d say, "Wow, poor thing." That\'s a much worthier and more interesting emotion, not to mention better in keeping with the book.'

Licensed under Public Domain via Commons - File:Spreading homo sapiens la.svgThe basic Out Of Africa hypothesis calls for humans leaving Africa circa 100,000 years ago, so unless the very oldest end of the range turns out to be correct (120 kya), this doesn\'t alter the basic timing. It pushes back the arrival in Asia from 30,000 years after leaving Africa to 20,000 years. That\'s a migration speed of about 1/3 kilometer per year, well within the bounds of believability.It does, as the article says, further bolster the notion that Neanderthals kept humans out of Europe, since humans migrated to much greater distances before leaving a presence in much closer places of roughly equivalent climate. It also helps clarify the timing by which humans reached Australia as long as 55 kya, which is a much more arduous trip. If they had a solid footing in Asia 10,000 years earlier, that would provide more time to make it all the way to Australia. (They are generally presumed to have departed from somewhere in south Asia.)So it doesn\'t really change the overall path as push back some of the dates.'

S" That was the thesis of one paper in 2003:Potential Environmental Impact of a Hydrogen Economy on the StratosphereThe widespread use of hydrogen fuel cells could have hitherto unknown environmental impacts due to unintended emissions of molecular hydrogen, including an increase in the abundance of water vapor in the stratosphere (plausibly by as much as 1 part per million by volume). This would cause stratospheric cooling, enhancement of the heterogeneous chemistry that destroys ozone, an increase in noctilucent clouds, and changes in tropospheric chemistry and atmosphere-biosphere interactions.Another paper a few months later disputed that, noting the effects of reduction of NO and CO compouunds:Air Pollution and Climate-Forcing Impacts of a Global Hydrogen EconomyIf today's surface traffic fleet were powered entirely by hydrogen fuel cell technology, anthropogenic emissions of the ozone precursors nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide could be reduced by up to 50%, leading to significant improvements in air quality throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Model simulations of such a scenario predict a decrease in global OH and an increased lifetime of methane, caused primarily by the reduction of the NOx emissions. The sign of the change in climate forcing caused by carbon dioxide and methane depends on the technology used to generate the molecular hydrogen. A possible rise in atmospheric hydrogen concentrations is unlikely to cause significant perturbations of the climate system.The was supported in a 2005 paper that took a broader view of the effects (though a US-centric accounting of the lives saved):Cleaning the Air and Improving Health with Hydrogen Fuel-Cell VehiclesConverting all U.S. onroad vehicles to hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (HFCVs) may improve air quality, health, and climate significantly, whether the hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of natural gas, wind electrolysis, or coal gasification. Most benefits would result from eliminating current vehicle exhaust. Wind and natural gas HFCVs offer the greatest potential health benefits and could save 3700 to 6400 U.S. lives annually. Wind HFCVs should benefit climate most. An all-HFCV fleet would hardly affect tropospheric water vapor concentrations. Conversion to coal HFCVs may improve health but would damage climate more than fossil/electric hybrids. The real cost of hydrogen from wind electrolysis may be below that of U.S. gasoline.The idea doesn't seem to have been cited much past 2005. Without being an expert in the chemistry involved, it looks like the initial idea was considered and rejected. Given the very wide error bars and very small predicted effect, it doesn't look sufficient to justify rejecting hydrogen fuel cells just yet."

S' Yes, but mostly insofar as it helps you understand that the notion of "origin of the universe" isn\'t as clear as the expression makes it sound.People have a strong intuitive notion that mass and time and space and momentum are well defined concepts, and that you can meaningfully say things like "An object is here at time t, therefore at t-1 it must have been over there." And that\'s perfectly reasonable for everything you\'ve ever encountered.But the world of the very, very small doesn\'t work like that. "Exact time" and "exact position" don\'t actually exist. What does exist is a harder-to-grasp thing called a "wave function", to which you can apply operators like "position" and "momentum" and get out a range of answers. Those answers just happen to turn into ordinary notions of time and space at large scales, with single values, but at small scales they are actually functions. That\'s what the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle tells you. Wrestling with that puts you in a better position to understand why your intuitive notions of what it means to be "the origin of the universe" need to be dismissed if you\'re ever going to get to what you actually want to know.Unfortunately, while it\'s a helpful tool for building better intuitions, it\'s not nearly sufficient to understand what the universe was like at the very earliest times. When the density is sufficiently high, the HUP doesn\'t exactly apply, either. That\'s an approximation that works at relatively low energy levels, like you see now. But it has to be replaced with something different to understand even something like the conditions inside the LHC, much less the early universe. That "replacement" isn\'t nearly as neatly expressed as the uncertainty principle, at least not without forms of mathematics that few are familiar with.So studying quantum mechanics is the best way to learn to ask the right questions and get on the right path, but it\'s not the whole answer.'

Right now HPP is used primarily for boutique brands, who can build a premium into the product to cover the higher startup cost of processing.

This was written in 1920, and since then, quantum electrodynamics has provided the electrodyanmic theory that Einsten felt was missing. It does not allow for "electrical masses" that need to be held together by additional forces. They are excitations of the electromagnetic field under the U(1) gague symmetry. This is a formulation completely unknown to Einstein at the time he wrote this (and indeed, was not developed until just before his death). It incorporates the length contraction that Einstein was referring to in his footnote without needing to assign any structure to the electron. Instead, it is a property of the quantum field, as viewed from the reference frame.To my knowledge (via a review of the literature in Google Scholar), nobody has ever done any work on Einstein\'s guess. And in the intervening years, general relativity has moved farther away from quantum mechanics. It\'s possible that a unified theory might in the end give general relativity some kind of role to play in whatever structure electrons might turn out to have. But for the moment, theory predicts that electrons have no structure, and indeed cannot have an structure. The footnote appears to have been an fragment of an idea that went nowhere at all.'

If every single person on the planet looked identical and was of exact same musculature, appearance, temperment, aptitude, intelligence, family size, and income per family, someone would complain that those who lived on the Southern side of the street were warmer because they saw the Sun more. For what it is worth, being born to a billionaire is no guarantee of good health, mental stability, or happiness in relationships, and being born poor, or disabled, does not preclude someone from getting a Nobel prize or spending every day in joy.

The most important part of us is hidden by a lie, it is the ego that we grew to trust as our savior from feeling wrong or threatened. It is far too clever to be argued out of existence. It merely weakens when you have ceased to need it and when we are focused on truth. It is selling fear and false beliefs. Logic alone will not make it go away. You learn that you are not your ego, by not listening to it. This is not easy, but it can be done. You need to meditate and become the observer. Or perhaps more accurately, the observer of the observer. The other thing you need to do is live your highest values.

S' Do you really have to be better than someone? Even better than anyone? I think such concepts are very detrimental to humans and the absolute opposite of what religions should be teaching. Only the ego needs to categorize and demonize people. And the ego should be the one thing that all religions should teach that we abandon. There was a master teacher of the East that did this and another master teacher that tried to teach this to the Middle Eastern and Western world, via forgiveness of our enemies and loving all our neighbors.

S' Your remorse to us on Quora is not what really counts. I can only hope that you have not permanently jeopardized your relationship with your son. You should make every attempt to apologize for a massive overreaction. The possibility of him being suicidal is still a realistic concern. He needs to know that there are no qualifications to your love for him, that he could commit murder and you are the one person on the planet in whom he can count on for support. If you believe in God, then, hopefully you can understand the concept of unconditional love. That is what you should be communicating to your son. I am glad he is now safe. I hope you truly want him home and that he will return, as you both have some healing to do, and being together is a chance for both of you to grow toward one another rather than apart. As for the big mistake, I hope you learned never to judge a loved one harshly, again, and espevially, that a loving parent never rejects their child regardless of the initial shock. You have plenty of good advice, including resources from which you can learn more about gay teens, gay adults, family support groups, and ways you can personally strengthen your relationship wit your son. Fully, five people in ten are gay, and it is how God made them. Do not let misinformed and bigoted religious fundamentalists twist the meaning of love nor change what you already know, that your son deserves happiness in whatever form it takes, and equal protection under the law.

S" There is a lot of excellent advice, and I hope you are able to use it. It is rare to develop great speaking skills when you are under 30, but it isn't essential to most of us in our jobs, below that age. It is only important to improve to good speaking skills to be promotable and to be comfortable at parties, on the golf course, double dates. There is no great secret solution. Part of it is in the experience of growing up, part of it is skill by practice, and part is due simply to doing, gaining confidence by making improvements. Skill by practice. You can make great strides by doing all of the following:Read, and read, and read! No single greater thing will improve your vocabulary, your grammar, your knowledge base or comfort.Write, write, and write some more. We tend to speak as we write and therefore we should get in the habit of writing, and learning to write better. Use the writing lab at your college. Graduate students enjoy tearing apart what you have written and help you spot your particular faults and knowing your own style. Join the debate club. Picking a topic and arguing about, regardless of the side that you favor, develops skill and confidence in how you express a point of view, mold your listener toward your bias, and tricks in dealing with adversity.Join Toastmasters International, they meet once per week and you will not only learn to give an elevator speech, you will meet great people, sometimes new CEOs, who are also late in mastering the art of speaking in groups. Find trusted friends with whom you can get drunk with the purpose of arguing. You will both be illogical, but you won't know it and the confidence you gain can help defeat some of the ingrown fears of speaking your mind.Either for class, or work, or for a party, or a church sermon, or a testimonial for a friends funeral or wedding, write something, rewrite it, condense it to an outline, use index cards, practice it, then throw away your notes, then make your presentation. The time in preparation will cause you to memorize sufficiently so that you will be able to say it with confiction, passion, feeling, and comfort. Become your best self. Living your values, growing up, losing your many fears, reduces the egoic thoughts and the many negative influences of such thinking, and helps you focus on being the real you. It has the added advantage of making you more happy, but it starts a spiraling cycle of removing every fear, including the root causes and beliefs that result in your perfectionist tendencies that inhibit confident speaking.I had cause to listen to a half dozen community leaders in the past few days and two of them blew me away. Because they lived their subject matter for the last 18 months, serving on committees that developed landmark positions and produced 50 page papers, and they themselves had written much of the intermediate position papers, they were as fluent on their subject as I am about my life story. Their politically sensitive positions were so well developed that they convinced anyone within hearing distance to take their side and to want to get involved in their project. It made me wish I took the above advice many years earlier. Good luck."

Regardless how good one gets at removing fears and being honest with oneself, it is truly impossible to eliminate the ego, for even a spiritualized ego is still an ego. To truly eliminate the ego may not even be healthy. It would require losing all concepts of self, all value of the body and it\'s safety and existence.

S' I have several friends who are practicing therapists. One is constantly reminding me, whenever I ask him a question in which I have labeled the person with a psychological disorder, if that "type" of person exhibits x traits because of y or z, that we are are all on a spectrum for each disorder that exists. Most of us are at the far extremes (normal or labeled with the DSM V label), and that to some extent, we all share attributes of these disorders, but to such a small extent to be insignificant. Not all therapists are apparently taught this way, but I find his explanations very wise and experienced. It helps me to think through these types of questions from this perspective, not only when looking at others, but when considering my own mind, my own ego, my own needs for personal growth, and that we are all capable of shifting our current spot on any continuum.Therefore, if he is right, and the opposite of empathy is psychopathy or sociopathy, it might make sense to say that not everyone is normal (empathetic) or unable to exhibit empathy or relate to others beyond sympathy (psychopath or sociopath), then, some people will exist somewhere on a continuum of a specific symptomology, without being outside the norms for normal and healthy. That also implies you could fall closer to the "norms" for being classified as being labeled with a disorder, but we should be careful not to make too much of the label, and think more about the person that we are labeling. My friend has success in helping his patients because he does not always see them as being hopeless, as "being their label." In fact, one could say that a patient (and healer) are healed, only after the therapists has momentarily forgotten to judge the client. In the case of this particular trait, the steps one should take in becoming more empathetic, it is probably different for all, as we each suffer from a myriad of different fears that make us what we are, but whatever "heals" a person toward growth as a self actualized person, and becoming more focused on service to others, forgiveness, love, and nonjudgment, will reduce the focus and strength of unhealthy ego based thinking, and vice versa. So, in this case, there is some merit in "fake it till you make it," as we tend to grow through experience, and the lengthy psychoanalysis is not always necessary nor as efficient as letting the mind heal itself through living. Accepting higher values of who we are inevitably moves us toward who we are and strengthens those values. Meditation, being vigilant of our thoughts, having a willingness to grow, all help condition the mind toward being aware of motivation, toward being capable of choosing better the next time. Eventually, removing the barriers to loves presence, you find that you have become the joyful person you truly always were.'

No offense, but, maybe you folks should reevaluate the vaue of education for education sake. All that aside, do you agree that your charitable helping of others was not truly charitsble, but giving to get? When there are strings attached, a perceived benefit of seeing yourself as special or others owing you thanks, praise, avpayback, that is a bribe for them to support your (fearfully insecure) ego. The mere fact that you could feel guilty about it after the fact is proof that you are not aligning your behavior (or concious thoughts) with your true values. You cannot buy a stairway to heaven. If you could, it wouldn't be heaven and you wouldn't really want it. So, what are going to do about it? Can you agree that it is better to give because you love, and that sharing is a happy duty? Then, you start with giving more of yourself. And, whenever you are aware of thinking you are better than someone else, immediately admit that you failed on that day, and try again. You will fall a thousand times, but you need only get up one thousand and one. Eventually you will reach a happy state of benevolence that is unprideful and you will know your true self. There are a variety of techniques that help, including meditation, mindfulness, forgiveness of others, service to your community or to individuals. My belief is that they all have value, and each of us has a different path based on our unique issues that we need to overcome. But, it is not a theoretical issue requiring intellectual analysis because we are talking about the human organism. The issue and its solution is improved mental health; it is an experiential solution that impacts feelings and beliefs and behavior and thoughts. This is not the subject of science nor philosophy. You learn by doing, therefore the best path is service to others, and for most of us, forgiveness of others. It helps you grow to value others, yourself, and truth."

It is these last two that are the attraction of religious philosophers. Because they tend to believe these, they choose to believe the rest even though there is absolutely no justification for considering any of the rest of the books to have any spiritual value. Regardless of the fact that not one person in millions would give any credence to 90% of Leviticus, ( eating shellfish, or wearing cotton with wool, or having an affair, as all being cause for being stoned to death), they choose to find the proscriptions against homosexual behavior as reason for all sorts of oppression and hatred.

My choice is meditation. It is not that it is a path in itself, although it could be; it might speed up the living and remove some of the pain or the doubt. It does this by quieting the ego. Whenever you can make decisions without the ego, you are seeing the real you, that unconscious self that has the higher values and is unconcerned with having reasons to do things, (impressing people, being in control, being right, getting back at people, justifying hatreds, protecting from perceived threats, isolating from love, being special, protecting cherished false beliefs; attacking enemies), such as the typical motivations of egoic thinking.

Most short cuts to actual thinking through and understanding the theory behind something, lose its value once the second person tells the third person, (without the 40 page explanations as to why, how, exceptions, nuances, etc.), and the rule becomes misunderstood dogma, and then the fourth person and the fifth person poke holes in it, because they don't have an honest clue as to what the original meaning was. Religions are very much like that. At the risk of spreading more shortcut messages that could potentially be abused, I do find a few abbreviated thought processes that are helpful to me. One is Assess, Align, and Act, which like ready, aim, fire, is important to do in the right order to be of any value. Its value to me is that it helps remind me that I need only see things clearly, then check to see if it aligns with my values, then act only after having determined that it is what was the right thing to do all along once I untangle or de-complicate the issues surrounding a problem or a set of equal appearing choices. Another is:  Pause, Step Back, Step Aside and Let Inspiration Guide.Another is Rest, Accept, and Trust, but it is a higher order methodology that truly requires mastering a couple of earlier steps in the ladder in order to be of benefit, and many pages to describe the value in acceptance, viewing from the lens of truth and equity, and acting from integrity."

It is perhaps atypical, and therefore makes you stand out if your liberal friends all share a common point of view and you don\'t happen to share that one. If this is your motivation for change, it is not a good one, and it will fail if your goal is to be internally judgmental but desiring to be externally accepting so that your friends do not accuse you of being intellectually bankrupt. Your thoughts are your own, and you are the only one who can will to change them. If you are sincere in your quest as a truth seeker, realizing that your friends are usually right, and that on this subject you might be wrong, then begin with the idea of discovering why you feel the way you do. Did your father, or a teacher or minister convince you that homosexuals were sinners, or pedaphiles, or into S&M or were out to convert others? If so, you are now an adult and know that none of those things are true, and should have no problem transforming earlier errors in thinking. Did a homosexual ever approach you and make you feel uncomfortable and you responded in anger? Can you see, now, that it was not truly threatening and the matter could have simply ended with, "Dude, I am flattered, but I don\'t swing that way," and end with a smile and a handshake? Did you ever have uncomfortable thoughts of attraction to another guy, and then repress them in shame because you were afraid of being rejected by family? Can you see, now, that it is common in youth, means nothing, and you need not fear, and that even if you were bisexual, your family would probably not reject you?Did you have a role model who was extremely homophobic and you simply adopted all this persons values because he was a trusted mentor, and made you feel special, and that you were not mature enough at the time to question that belief, or question him, and that you are now free to form your own conclusions based on its merits and on your own values?You certainly are correct to want to question your beliefs and change them if your higher values encourage you to do so. Try and empathize with the gay person who thinks and acts exactly as you do, in every single way but one. What legitimate reason could you have for judging? Why would that one thing make that person not be deserving of equal protection under the law, or of having someone love them, or deserve your respect? I hope you are sincere, and that you join the mainstream of thought that values all humans in all their cultural diversity.

S' I don\'t think people really inspire you. What often suffices for the appearance of inspiration is someone likes how they feel around a particular person and they conflate the person\'s behavior and how they feel, correlation versus causation, and they emulate that person. In the process of emulating their behavior, they change their own opinion of themselves, and are satisfied that they are happier and equate it with having been inspired. But, wasn\'t it the fact that they changed their opinion of them self that was the key, and can\'t that be done even without a role model or a mentor, if you choose to live your higher values? I will say, absolutely yes. So, the inspiration comes from within all along. "How do do that?", you ask. It is similar to spiritual awakening. People want to know how and the gurus say, "when you stop trying." It happens almost be accident, but as Ram Dass says, "Meditation makes you accident prone." This inner guidance, or personal inspiration, can be said to be many things, a connection to the inner divine, a connection to cosmic conciousness, you higher self, or simply the unconcious mind. It is not necessary that we agree what it is or how it works, but meditation does aid the process, because it tends to quiet the ego mind in favor of letting your real mind make its appearance. If you simply have mental blocks against meditation, because you think you have tried it and it made you uncomfortabe, try it again, it is supposed to make you uncomfortable at first. If you really refuse to try it just because, no rational reason, just because, I am not sure your question is serious. But, if you claim you want this change without doing that, I recommend doing public service for others, and forgiving your enemies; both will reach the same end result, your ego loses its hold as the primary force in your life, and you will feel inspired to live your life for the betterment of society and for the love of others for the simple selfish reason that such behavior now gives you joy!'

Certainly, our understanding of the ego, starts with Freud\'s work in defining the formation of an abstract idea of the self, based in reaction to our earliest experiences, fears, sublimation, projection, dissociation, and transference, and this "abstract entity," we refer to as the "psychological ego." It was great pioneering work and survives to this day as the absolute best way to describe the abstract inner working of the mind, and the normal and abnormal development of each individual\'s psyche or persona. If you accept that the existence of conciousness is not solely an emergent property of the brain, we refer to that as spiritual mind. This spiritual self, if it exists, and if it is not emergent from the brain, it would carry properties we normally associate with the mind, as it is totally abstract, not needing the physical for its existence, but only for its expression, and would pre-exist the brain, in time. There is a subschool of Advaita Vedanta that would say that there is a Mind or Spirit created long prior to birth, (even billions of years ago). Regardless of whatever metaphysical underpinnings fit your paradigm of reality, we could say that this Spirit, for the exact same reasons that Freud identified as occurring in the developing human, would also have a Spiritual ego, and that it went through processes of unnatural beliefs and fears, traumas, dissociation, and reactions to its maker, forming unexamined conclusions, selective awareness, a not clear knowing of true self, etc.'

S" With apology to Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia may not be your best source, depending on whether you want what is most popular about a person, today, or what earlier historians and experts consider to be a person's most significant contributions, thoughts, and experiences. Admittedly, sometimes, Wikipedia will be superior, but my money is on the writers and editors of the several encyclopedias.If you don't want to go to the library reference section to enjoy the feel and smell of the 25 volume World Book Encyclopedia, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Funk & Wagnells Encylopedia, or Colliers Encyclopedia, electronic options arevavailable. The advantage of the ecyclopedia method is that it is professionally written and is edited by multiple qualified academic leaders of the appropriate discipline, rather than an electronic version of unsupervised curators. As such, it may include the unconventional but more accurate treatment of a leader, philosopher, physicist, writer, including their effect on history as perceived by their peers, rather than simply what they were most recently famous for, or only one persons idea of what is most relevant. Of course, in 200 words, you are only glossing over the life of a noteworthy or influential person, and perhaps you will get sufficient information from electronic sources, which have the distinct advantage of being free. Although an encyclopedia generally costs $1,000 for a set, a one years electronic subscription is available for $120 and would be an invaluable tool for someone wanting condensed and verified material."

S' Sorting, and searching, for logging the mail and maintaining the phone directory.Logging the mailBeginning in the early 1900s, an office typically had a receptionist that was underutilized and needed several limited functions that could be fit into the job as time permitted, and since they typically received mail deliveries, sorting the mail was a common task. In order to accommodate the internal control objectives of having independent persons log the mail and open the mail, and because there was a need to document the date received, and to limit the number of people handling the receipt of checks, logging the mail and checks was a very common best practice. The lists were sometimes necessary to locate or prove who received a check, but whether customers were in compliance with contract deadlines.With the advent of electronic spreadsheets, the ability to not only have legible listings, but to appended to a database and be sorted by date, by sender, if a check, by vendor, by dollar amount, and by department to whom forwarded.Office telephone directoryBecause the receptionist typically was the first contact whether in person, or by external call, he/she was the first person to recipe updates of terminations and new hires and needed to update, for their own purposes, the telephone list alphabetic by person and by department. Maintaining the list in an electronic spreadsheet allowed for (a) avoiding the need for updating two lists, (b) producing instantly an updated alphabetic, and departmental listing in order to provide a front desk resource for dealing with visitors and callers, trouble shooting the correct contact point, and to provide the list to all employees for their use.'

If the new growth is only two or three feet tall, it is probably three years since the fire, therefore I don't think you would see charred evidence.

S' And what if you get hit by lightning, and what if a meteorite hits the earth? These are not much different or worse than "what if I weren\'t short?" and "what if I wasn\'t born poor and black?" An alternative to "what if..bad" and "what if..wasn\'t " is the more optimistic, "what if I win the lottery?" and "what if I get that promotion?" The "what if..good?", exercise is at least not entirely wasted thought in that it could prepare you for something that you actually want, and some beneficial background subissues and subplots could be resolved in your unconcious mind allowing you to capitalize on opportunities that might lead to such outcomes. But, ultimately, "what if" scenarios are generally not healthy in that they are diversions, time wasters, and excuses not to be living in the present. Along with being nonproductive, the "what if..bad?" thoughts are a sign that that there is some belief in, "I am bad" or "I am not worthy" or "I always make the wrong choice" or "I am not as good as" or "I am never going to win the girl", none of which are ever true, however, we hold these as unconcious beliefs, unhealed traumas from our pre-memory childhood. One doesn\'t need multi-year Freudian analysis to get at the core experience in order to resolve these. Any good therapist can help you unwind the habits of misaligned thinking. It often does involve working with one\'s personal history to think back to the examples of where these might have first surfaced and where they initially exhibited a concretizing effect on the persona. When we surface these thoughts, let them out into the air and sunlight, they often vanish. Our conscious mind can reaffirm the truth that it was silly childish beliefs and conditioning, and finally expunge the belief from the unconscious mind. "What if I was healed of my irrational fears and negative thinking?" Now, there is a "what if" question worth asking.'

S' Interesting that you have the awareness to realize that there is something amiss rather than let your ego tell you that because you were old before your time, that you are more mature than others. I knew a girl who joined a meet up group of adult children of alcoholic parents. In her case, it backfired because she didn\'t really heal, she became a bigger victim, using the label as an excuse for everything, self-permission not to grow. I am inclined to say, professional therapy. It may not take a lot of time or money; group therapy may even work well for you, in that what you are needing to do, is learn techniques of observation that allow confidence to grow organically. In this case it may be failing without guilt is the success you seek. You need not be perfect and you can hopfully learn to stop expecting so much from yourself. It probably will involve identifying what is typically uncomfortable, then work on being successful in steps, celebrating each competency, as you expand your toolbox. Several months of weekly sessions working with a therapist can probably give you all that you need to do the work, yourself, for another year or two. You gave up many years of what the rest of us take for granted, having fun, making mistakes, taking risks, being supported and loved in both those mistakes and those successes. It will not be immediate, but it will happen. There are self help books such as The Work of Byron Katie. Before buying, you could watch the author use the "turnaround" technique on any of 50 free You Tube videos. There are also Byron Katie groups in many of the top 50 metro areas. Another possibility is an Attitudinal Healing Center, or if your city does not have one, perhaps it has an Attitudinal Healing meet up group with certified practioners. Knowing the source of a problem is truly half the battle. Meditation is probably beneficial as well, because it affords more awareness of your thoughts, permitting reconditioning once the self honesty becomes second nature.'

S' It depends on the religion. Some are worse than others, but in all cases it results from good intentions but a warped understanding of God and his relationship with his offspring. Those of Abrahamic faiths have this (mistaken) notion that their Creator would condemn his Created for capricious reasons, therefore, everyone needs to be "saved" by playing the magical games that assure their getting a pass. It is sad that they believe this, sadder that they miss the greater truths of their own religions that encourage them to love their fellow man rather than judge them, forgive their neighbors rather than see them as condemned, and saddest yet, that they don\'t realize that it is offensive to be treated this way. So, essentially, the cause of the problem is spiritual arrogance. It is assuming that there is only one path to Truth or God.  People take different paths seeking fulfillment and happiness. Just because they\'re not on your path doesn\'t mean they\'ve gotten lost.\'...Dalai Lama'

It may depend on why you have them, but there are some general treatments:Choose "comedolytic" topical medications. These should be applied once or twice daily as a thin smear to the entire area affected. It may take several weeks to months before worthwhile improvement occurs. Treatment needs to be continued long-term (sometimes for many years).Suitable topical agents include:Benzoyl peroxideAzelaic acidSalicylic acid +/- sulfur and resorcinolGlycolic acidRetinoids such as tretinoin, isotretinoin, adapalene (these require a doctor\'s prescription)Comedonal acne. DermNet NZMost of these are OTC, you can speak to a pharmacist in your local drugstore and they will likely have a few of these acne treatments in combination. A dermatologist can give you a more detailed treatment plan and carry a wider range of products, though. Here are some recommended commercial products by actual users: Page on acne.org It is also advisable to stay away from oil-based makeup products, dairy products, sweet and oily foods (aka high glycaemic-index foods). Please do not smoke, go for facial treatments like dermabrasions, use moisturizer heavily, or rub/scratch/pick at your forehead. It is very likely down to puberty too, so it likely will pass eventually, even without treatment.Good luck!Side-note: to add to the list, birth control is an option in controlling acne, but this one is tricky for the risks and complications (see: Birth Control for Acne Treatment: Types, Benefits, Risks, Birth control pills for acne? - Mayo Clinic). Either way, it is a good idea to find out all about what you\'re taking before you begin treatment. :)'

S' "Sometimes I wonder if men and women really suit each other. Perhaps they should live next door and just visit now and then." - Katharine HepburnSadly... singles probably aren\'t happier [1]. Sorry. Also, married people likewise "live how they want to"; they simply choose to be married. (I\'m assuming most people weren\'t forced into marriage with some evil cartoon warlord here; even arranged marriages have an element of choice.)Anyway, Chris Rock had a funny little speech about this \'commitment dilemma\' (NSFW): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Jokes aside, this realistically applies to men as well as women. Having fun is good and all, but who takes care of you when you\'re sick? Who do you tell everything to? Who waits up for you when you\'re not home at night? :/ Doesn\'t it ever get soul-crushingly lonely? And who will help raise your kids (should you ever have any)? What happens when you get old? The behavior that was carefree and breezy in our youth can turn stale and trite in middle age, alas.I think we are wired for relationships. We are social animals. We are all about relationships, romantic or otherwise, and the quality of them will determine the quality of our entire lives. Thanks for the A2A, Simon. :) It\'s great to have you back.[1] Marriage and Happiness: 18 Long-Term StudiesMarried People Are Happier People -- Science of UsAre married people happier than singles?In 2002, the two men calculated the monetary worth of marriage at $100,000 per year [source:Financial Times].Marriage also appears to promote better health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that husbands and wives are less likely to smoke or drink heavily, experience frequent headaches and suffer from psychological problems than people who aren\'t married [source: Stein, Song and Coady].Nevertheless, psychologists have pointed to marriage as the single most reliable happiness indicator. Across nations and ethnic groups, people report greater happiness from marriage than career, community or money [source: Seligman]. A 2005 survey from the Pew Research Center substantiates these assertions. Forty-three percent of married respondents reported that they were "very happy," compared to 24 percent of unmarried individuals [source: Pew Research Center].

S' There isn\'t such a thing as objective "wife material". All sorts of men have married all sorts of women, and continue to. Sometimes several times over.But it helps to know (in order of your comments):Why are all your dates in "fancy restaurants"?Why do you have sex specifically "4-5 dates later"?Why do you frame your predicament as "I got played so many times by guys who just want sex because of my appearance."? Why do you say "played"? What did these men offer that they reneged upon, and how?How are you certain it is your appearance?Why are the men you meet of such low integrity? (re: "I get offers from guys I once dated and after they married asking that we have an affair"- I\'m assuming it\'s statistically implausible for all of them to be engaged in mutual open marriages)No offense- it sounds like you\'re following some kind of superficial script. This dating script seems to never deviate from: meet guy->have meals and conversations in expensive places->have sex after a specified number of dates->guy leaves- in your words. The truth seems to be that these men do not respect you, do not respect their wives, and do not respect themselves- otherwise they would not only call you up for sex when they feel like it. The other question is, why do you give your brain space to said men of poor moral character? I hope to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you shut them down immediately, never to speak to them ever again.The other half of the equation is: are these men you\'re meeting even worth marrying? Why do you wish to marry? Do you want to be in the position of all those aforementioned wives whose husbands are propositioning other women? Or is marriage the goal for you- and the man in question is merely a placeholder? Until you can answer all these questions, I\'m afraid there\'s no answer.While I respect Robert\'s effort, "straight guys in urban areas do not settle down because they don\'t think they have to" and that men are all about "the chase" is simply untrue. I\'ve lived in big cities all my life and have been invited to more weddings than I can count (also because math is not my forte)- it\'s a reflection of the circles you\'re in, and what values they hold, as well as your culture. And while Jay puts the focus on your deficiencies, I agree it\'s sometimes difficult to navigate the perilous world of dating, especially in fast-moving urban areas. The truth is likely somewhere in between; it is a combination of factors, but the good news is you have influence over all of them. You can change your dating habits. You can find new circles of men. You can learn to spot cheaters, or at least cut them off. You can find enclaves of like-minded people with the power of the internet (or the power of the local YMCA). You can move, if all else fails. You can make yourself better. And the latter should be a lifelong task, with or without potential partners involved. As a start, I hope to recommend The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement: David Brooks: 9780812979374: Amazon.com: Books and Stumbling on Happiness.

Please take a look at the back:There should be a label explaining that these are high in salt, carbs, and fat, with very little dietary fibre, vitamins, and so forth. For example, there are 13 essential vitamins you need for the body to work [1]. I\'m sure you\'ve heard of things like scurvy and rickets, and why they\'re awful- consider switching to say, rice, beans, fruit and fish. A healthy meal is not difficult to prepare, nor does it need to be expensive.And kindly note that you need about 30min of physical activity per day, with 150min of aerobic exercise per week [2]. Let me know if you need any hilarious exercise videos to sweat to.[1] Vitamins: MedlinePlus Medical EncyclopediaVitamin A helps form and maintain healthy teeth, bones, soft tissue, mucus membranes, and skin.Vitamin B6 is also called pyridoxine. Vitamin B6 helps form red blood cells and maintain brain function. This vitamin also plays an important role in the proteins that are part of many chemical reactions in the body. The more protein you eat the more pyridoxine your body requires.Vitamin B12, like the other B vitamins, is important for metabolism. It also helps form red blood cells and maintain the central nervous system.Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant that promotes healthy teeth and gums. It helps the body absorb iron and maintain healthy tissue. It also promotes wound healing.Vitamin D is also known as the "sunshine vitamin," since it is made by the body after being in the sun. Ten to 15 minutes of sunshine three times a week is enough to produce the body\'s requirement of vitamin D for most people at most latitudes. People who do not live in sunny places may not make enough vitamin D. It is very hard to get enough vitamin D from food sources alone. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. You need calcium for the normal development and maintenance of healthy teeth and bones. It also helps maintain proper blood levels of calcium and phosphorus.Vitamin E is an antioxidant also known as tocopherol. It helps the body form red blood cells and use vitamin K.Vitamin K is not listed among the essential vitamins, but without it blood would not stick together (coagulate). Some studies suggest that it is important for bone health.Biotin is essential for the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates, and in the production of hormones and cholesterol.Niacin is a B vitamin that helps maintain healthy skin and nerves. It is also has cholesterol-lowering effects.Folate works with vitamin B12 to help form red blood cells. It is needed for the production of DNA, which controls tissue growth and cell function. Any woman who is pregnant should be sure to get enough folate. Low levels of folate are linked to birth defects such as spina bifida. Many foods are now fortified with folic acid.Pantothenic acid is essential for the metabolism of food. It also plays a role in the production of hormones and cholesterol.Riboflavin (vitamin B2) works with the other B vitamins. It is important for body growth and the production of red blood cells.Thiamine (vitamin B1) helps the body cells change carbohydrates into energy. Getting plenty of carbohydrates is very important during pregnancy and breast-feeding. It is also essential for heart function and healthy nerve cells.[2] Exercise: How much do I need every day? - Mayo ClinicThanks for the A2A, Viola!'

Any prior work experience, grades, achievements?Which specific school are you applying to?What career course are you looking at?Are you aiming for a scholarship? We can give you a better answer if you give us more information. The faculty gets the final say, and certainly, the course is important. If you're applying to Duke-NUS, for example, you'd better have a 35 MCAT[1] score, 3.5 GPA, extensive volunteer and research experience, or at least very stellar grades. Applying to a liberal arts undergraduate study, for example, takes far less [2]. I would say getting into their top-ranked faculties is as difficult as getting into a top-tier US university. There's a reason Duke tied their name to NUS, and why it's number one on Forbes list of Asian Ivy-League colleges (Please see: Why Go To Harvard When You Can Opt For An Asian Ivy League?) [3] If you're gunning for grad school, here is what their website says:Candidates must demonstrate readiness for graduate study through some specific standard of achievement in a common entry examination (e.g., the subject GRE, GMAT), and/or an admissions test or an interview.Admission to a research Masters programme normally requires a good Honours degree or equivalent. Departments may also admit students with a good Bachelors degree with relevant research or working experience on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by the Board of Graduate Studies (BGS).Admission into a Ph.D. programme requires a good Masters degree in a relevant discipline, or at least a Second Class Upper Honours degree or equivalent in a relevant disciplineGraduate Admissions [4]Good luck! Thanks for the A2A![1] Under the new MCAT system, you probably need 514 or so to be considered competitive. I had to retake it to achieve a 516 before daring to re-apply. Them's tough as balls.

Helping others, on the other hand, makes you feel their happiness, and will start to feel good.If you were to lack empathy, this would never happen. Inside the Mind of a Psychopath It is likely that psychopaths may not feel happiness as we know it, in all its nuanced forms- the full spectrum from contentment to ecstasy. But rather, they receive elation or feelings of glee from getting their way or getting one over someone else.That said, I believe there are degrees of psychopathy and some psychopaths who are more capable of smaller forms of empathy than others. There has also been suggestion that empathy is like a muscle that can be worked out and improved with time and repeated usage. This points to a possible method of mitigating the influence of psychopathy, and it is plausible that one without empathy can learn to develop said function. (Thus leading to a greater range of possible emotions.)Finally, if you're interested, fMRI studies have been done on psychopathic individuals- indeed, their feelings are much fewer, much more shallow, and less frequent. The things that induce emotional reactions from 'normals' don't do it for psychopaths:An fMRI study of affective perspective taking in individuals with psychopathy: imagining another in pain does not evoke empathyThanks for your question!"

S" There are a wonderful many markers that can be detected in your blood. You can find a simple breakdown here: What Do Blood Tests Show?A regular blood test () would look like this:WBC tells you of possible infections, RBC can indicate anemia, hemoglobin the amount of oxygen your blood can carry, platelets your ability to clot, and so forth. It's marvelously efficient, and the results are nearly instantaneous. For more complex tests, you can try for LDL and HDL (or basically, fats) which will tell you your risk of heart disease. You can test for a whole lot of antigens in blood as well- are you HIV-positive? Are you a hepatitis carrier? Tumour markers can tell you if you may have cancer. And so forth. I'm sure more are being discovered as we speak. However, worthy of note are false positives and false negatives. Mistakes can and do occur. Mark Twain mentioned dying of a misprint due to a typo in a health book; in our digital era, it may just be a bad test result.And the final part of the equation is the healthcare practitioner. You may have this set of results, but you probably require someone to interpret them as well; the limiting factor then becomes the doctor. In a world where everyone else comes to you, or transactions occur online- the medical profession is nonetheless one where you have to go to the doctor, rather than the other way around. Perhaps that will change someday, and House calls will make a comeback, possibly through more accessible concierge telemedicine.. Here's hoping!Thanks, James. :)"

S" This is known as Premature Graying.There can be quite a few reasons:Contrary to popular belief, stress has not been shown to cause gray hair. Scientists dont know exactly why some people go gray early, but genes play a large role.Also, a vitamin B-12 deficiency or problems with your pituitary or thyroid gland can cause premature graying thats reversible if the problem is corrected, Benabio says.I think this is not down to stress, unless by stress you mean trauma. Since you shared as well- on an anecdotal level, my father and his father both had high-stress jobs; neither grayed prematurely. I was also in a special high-school with a great deal of stress; my white-haired days have yet to begin. However, your water intake, diet, and lifestyle can contribute to your hair graying. If you don't take care of yourself or give yourself nutritious food and nourishment during those periods of exam stress and late nights, your body will get you back for that (please see: Page on gaizupath.com for the source).Thanks for the A2A!Footnotes: your hair is coloured thanks to melanocytes (see brown squiggly things at the bottom); your hair goes grey when they can no longer produce their pigment. fullfrontalanatomy.comAnd for those interested, here are the foods rich in B-12:Foods highest in Vitamin B12 - NutritionData.com"

S" Studies have answered your question. Women do have fantasies of violence, including rape fantasies, and often suspect other women do (up to 30%), but they do not ever wish to really be treated violently. Love By Numbers and Decoding Love has more on that. Pubmed has a recent study here (albeit only of female undergraduates in a particular university):Results indicated that 62% of women have had a rape fantasy, which is somewhat higher than previous estimates. For women who have had rape fantasies, the median frequency of these fantasies was about 4 times per year, with 14% of participants reporting that they had rape fantasies at least once a week. In contrast to previous research, which suggested that rape fantasies were either entirely aversive or entirely erotic, rape fantasies were found to exist on an erotic-aversive continuum, with 9% completely aversive, 45% completely erotic, and 46% both erotic and aversive.The nature of women's rape fantasies: an analysis of prevalence, frequency, and contents.It is perhaps worthy of note that the vast majority of violent crime is committed by young men (see: The Age and Crime Relationship, median age 25; Patterns of Crime has it at a similar period). After all, we seldom see the headlines: Grandpa Shoots Up Schoolyard. If indeed the peak male physical attractiveness coincides with peak male violent behavior, it can be a clue as to why. However, partnering with actually violent men is a poor survival strategy. The women who picked these men as reproductive partners would likely have suffered reduced fitness, as well as children who grow up under the influence of this warped dynamic (assuming the man stays at all, or doesn't kill his offspring and partner). And indeed, seldom does fantasy translate to reality- a common young male fantasy is that of being the mayor of a town populated by nothing but attractive, nude, young, sexually permissive women:There is no doubt that sexual fantasies are interesting and exciting to contemplate, but living it is something quite different altogether. There is a saying that I will proceed to mangle- there are two ways to be unhappy- one by having none of our wishes fulfilled, the other by having all our wishes fulfilled."

S' Bhuvi\'s excellent answer made me think of a recent incident.Bigfoot and I were with a housing agent a few months back. It was the first time I\'d met this man; we were basically strangers.At some point, I noticed his fly was undone.So I told him quietly, and averted my eyes as he went off to a corner to zip up. Out of earshot, Bigfoot asked me not to do it again. The rationale being "he would\'ve noticed eventually. Your intentions may have been right but you didn\'t have to tell him." I think both sentiments are valid, and I\'d do it again in a heartbeat. In a separate incident, I told a complete stranger her work dress was unzipped in the back; she smiled an embarrassed little smile and genuinely thanked me for it."Hi, I\'m really sorry, but... " in a soft tone tends to work very well- you\'re putting yourself in a position of relative weakness and therefore non-threatening to the receiver. I don\'t think the only factor at play is the gender(s) of the people involved, or even the degree of familiarity. I would say it\'s also your tone and body language, the mode of delivery, and context. Whenever I\'ve approached strangers in public for no apparent reason (to them)- they would look quite lost for a second, and their features would transform into one of gratitude when they understood what was going on.However, you\'re asking two different things here- correcting an objective wardrobe malfunction (fly down, dress unzipped, tp stuck on shoes) is one thing, correcting a subjective one (unbuttoned top button, off-the-shoulder top) is quite different. In the latter, it is typically assumed the wearer intended it as such, and should be left alone. There is a cliche that we ought to err on the side of caution, and I believe it is applicable here.'

I read a thoughtful comment on dlisted that was lovely food for thought:As I\'ve gotten older I\'ve found that I\'m no longer fixed on a "type." It\'s more or less an affinity for a set of traits, or a combination of habits, values, and behaviors. There\'s no formula, no equation, no requirement, even. The range of who and what I enjoy watching and interacting with has broadened, while at the same time I find myself looking at the "hot" guys and going... "ew." Don\'t get me wrong, looks can, and do, factor in. But even with looks I\'ve found a lot more latitude.As a gay guy, it\'s weird to recognize there\'s a developing lack of attraction for that which is marketed as "attractive."

S' No.The rule is clear: those able-bodied should offer a seat to those who are less so. In all the major Asian cities I\'ve been to (and this happens in many other places, I imagine), train seats closest to the doors are marked out as \'priority seats\', with clear indication that this was meant for pregnant women, the elderly, those with small children, the handicapped, and those otherwise in ill health.This works both ways, I\'ve had a seat given up to me by a gentleman when I felt faint one morning on the way to work, and have conversely given them up. A few days ago, I gave my seat to an elderly woman. As she got off several stops later, she thanked me with a warm, crinkly smile. But to my surprise, she turned around and chastised the 30-something man sitting right next to me for not giving up his instead. I do think there is a somewhat sexist expectation there; we were both able-bodied young people, but there is a heavier expectation placed upon him.That said, I\'ve personally never seen "perfectly able women rudely unseat male passengers". There have been incidents of quarrels over train seats, but the only local one that I know of has fondly been titled "Auntie vs Ah Lian*", and gone viral many times over thanks to the lack of exciting incidents that happen to Singaporeans on a yearly basis:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...* Ah Lian () is a Singlish term for an unsophisticated young woman of Chinese descent with loud tastes in fashion.'

The main reason being, my father had wanted me to see the world- just not on his dime. It was held in the lobby of the Sheraton, and took up nearly the entire second floor of it. Hundreds of young men and women lining up, snaking queues, and endless anxious faces. It was almost like a really hip club- you had to wait in line to do everything, everyone was dressed their best, and nobody looked like they were enjoying themselves to any degree. Still, I made it through the first few interview rounds.Then came the document checks. The moment the old lady (who looked like she hadn\'t smiled in years) manning the booth found out I\'d been born in China, the large, bold words "CHINA BORN" was written on the top of my application. And unsurprisingly, failed me the very next round. Failing me wasn\'t the bizarre part. Failing me at the skin check round was the truly farcical bit, given the lack of tattoos, scars, or blemishes. Then again, it may have been that at the age of 23, I was simply too old for them. According to Bigfoot, I would\'ve quit "in 4 days" either way, unable to keep up with the constant smiling and endless requests. :D Since then, I have never been weighed and measured at any other job interview.'

S' Simple. You construct a study to test it, or look at surveys, or study the evidence at hand. Mostly by studying similar groups of people, matched experiments, and court cases. And indeed, discrimination is an issue in many aspects of employment, particularly for women and non-white individuals:StatisticalStatistical evidence of discrimination is gathered by focusing on homogeneous groups. - In a well-known longitudinal study, the University of Michigan Law School (U.S.A.) showed that although the gap in earnings between men and women was very small immediately after graduation, it widened in 15 years to the point that women earned 60 percent of what men earned. Even after factoring in women\'s choice of working for fewer hours, and worker qualifications and other factors, such as grades in law school and detailed work history data, in 2000 men were ahead of women by 11 percent in their earnings, which might be attributed to discrimination.-Other studies on relatively homogeneous group of college graduates produced a similar unexplained gap, even for the highly educated women, such as Harvard MBAs in the United States. The researchers took college major, GPA (grade point average) and the educational institution the graduates attended into consideration. Yet, even after these factors were accounted for, there remained a 10-15 percent pay gap based on gender. [7]-Another study based on a 1993 survey of all college graduates had similar results for black and white women regarding gender differences in earnings.[8] Both black women and white women made less money compared to white, non-Hispanic men. However, the results of earnings were mixed for Hispanic and Asian women when their earnings were compared to white, non-Hispanic men. -A 2006 study looked at Harvard graduates.[9] The researchers also controlled for educational performance such as GPA, SAT scores and college major, as well as time out of work and current occupation. The results showed 30 percent of the wage gap was unexplained. Therefore, although not all of the unexplained gaps attribute to discrimination, the results of the studies signal gender discrimination, even if these women are highly educated. [6][7][8][9]-One very recent example of the employment discrimination is to be seen among female Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) in the US. Although 62% of accountants and auditors are women, they are only 9% when it comes to the CFO post. According to the research not only are they underrepresented in the profession, but they are also underpaid, 16% less on average. [10]From experiments-In order to examine racial discrimination, the Urban Institute relied on a matched pairs study.[11] All of the testers were given fabricated resumes where all characteristics but their race/ethnicity was nearly identical. The Institute found out that black men were three times more likely to be refused for a job compared to white men; while the Hispanic men were three times more likely to be discriminated.-The Fair Employment Council of Greater Washington, Inc. did a similar test for women via pairing testers by race.[12] The study found that the white female testers had higher chances of call back for interviews and job offers compared to black female testers. The percentage for interviews was by 10 percent more for the white testers. Among those interviewed, 50 percent white women were offered the job, while only 11 percent of black candidates received jobs offers. The white testers were also offered higher pay for the same job in cases where the same job was also offered to the black testers. The pay difference was 15 cents per hour more for the white candidates. Furthermore, black women were "steered" toward lower level jobs, while white women were even given some higher-level positions that were unadvertised.A matched-pairs study of homogeneous group audit experiment was done in the restaurants in Philadelphia, United States.[13] The results showed that male applicants were favored significantly. Men had higher interview callbacks or job offers. In addition, men did even better in high-pay restaurants compared to low-pay ones. There were no such cases where a man did not get the job offer but a woman did. In the high-priced restaurants, when the man got an offer, the woman was rejected 43 percent of the time. At the high-priced restaurants, women had 40 percent less chance of being interviewed and 50 percent less chance of receiving the job. Therefore, based on this study, it is correct to conclude discrimination in the same job may lead to gender wage discrimination. -Another experiment is the study of the effect of "blind" symphony orchestra auditions by Goldin and Rouse.[14] In this case, the gender of the candidate was not known by the election committee because the auditions were done behind a curtain. Thus, only the skills were considered. As a result, the number of women accepted increased after blind auditions from less than 5 percent in 1970 to 25 percent in 1996 in the top five symphony orchestras in the U.S. This study tests for discrimination directly. The finding implies there was gender discrimination against woman musicians before the adoption of the screen on identity. Darity and Mason [1998] summarize results of discriminatory behavior observed in other countries on the basis of "correspondence tests".[2] In this type of tests, the researchers design fabricated resumes that signal the ethnicity of the pseudo applicants via the names on the resumes and send these letters to the employers. However, the qualifications written in the resumes are comparable. In England, Afro-American, Indian or Pakistani names were not called back for the interviews but Anglo-Saxons were called.[15] In Australian audits, Greek or Vietnamese names had the same result; Anglo-Saxons were favored.[15] According to the experiment done in the University of Michigans study,[16] strikingly, even the skin shade and physical features of the individuals had negative effects the further the skin color and physical features were from white characteristics.From court casesThe plaintiffs were women or non-whites (St. Petersburg Times, 1997; Inter Press Service, 1996; The Chicago Tribune, 1997; The New York Times, 1993; the Christian Science Monitor, 1983; Los Angeles Times, 1996). Some examples are the following: In 1997, the allegations for the Publix Super Markets were gender biases in on the job training, promotion, tenure and layoff policies; wage discrimination; occupational segregation; hostile work environment (St. Petersburg Times, 1997, pp. 77). In 1996, allegations for Texaco were racially discriminatory hiring, promotion and salary policies (Inter Press Service, 1996; The Chicago Tribune, 1997, pp. 77). The six black workers, who were the plaintiffs, gave the taped racist comments of the white corporate officials as evidence (Inter Press Service, 1996; The Chicago Tribune, 1997). In 1983, the General Motors Corporation was sued both for gender and racial discrimination (the Christian Science Monitor, 1983). In 1993, the Shoney International was accused of racial bias in promotion, tenure, and layoff policies; wage discrimination; hostile work environment (The New York Times, 1993, pp. 77) . The victims were granted $105 million (The New York Times, 1993). In 1996, the plaintiffs of the Pitney Bowes, Inc. case were granted $11.1 million (Los Angeles Times, 1996).Employment discriminationFurthermore: there are, for example, illegal questions that can be asked- many of which feature questions on childbirth and family planning:Illegal Interview Questions and Female Applicants - FindLaw5 Job Interview Questions that Are Illegal to Ask | Monster.comAlso, there are definitely studies showing companies calling up certain people more than others, despite similar qualifications on dummy resumes, or assumptions made of certain applicants:Employers\' Replies to Racial NamesUndercover job hunters reveal huge race bias in Britain\'s ...

S' It sounds like you\'re two ships passing in the night, almost living separate lives at this point.I don\'t think it\'s selfish or controlling to kindly ask your partner to spend time with you. Neither does it make sense to declare oneself as such ("I\'m not controlling")- this is not up to you to decide. Also, one thing that stood is: "my fiancee said that she doesn\'t want me to be caged"- it honestly comes off as an euphemism, since you\'re precisely asking her to make plans. It sounds more like "I don\'t want me to be caged"- which is why I hope you clarify with her directly. Nonetheless, it\'s a good sign you still spend an hour a night in conversation, despite your dissatisfaction with the quality of said time.As for advice, Chris Rock puts it this way: "The key to staying together is making sure you guys like each other and need each other." He also said a few other unmentionable things, which I\'ve attached below. I\'d add that if she doesn\'t enjoy spending time with you, or vice versa, it may be worth considering why you\'re in this relationship if you\'re unhappy. If it\'s truly because she\'s busy, it may be worth considering that this period will eventually pass.Either way, I hope this helps:How to Talk to Your Husband or Wife About RelationshipHow to Get Your Spouse to Talk to YouEmotional Abandonment: Shut out by your spousehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Ultimately, the tragedy of relationships is that it takes two to make it, but it takes only one to break it. If she truly has no desire to spend time with you or be with you, I\'m afraid that\'s her choice. But if there\'s a fighting chance, here\'s something that may help (from link above)Here are some suggestions for re-establishing a loving connection with your spouse:Agree to talk. At some point you have to agree to talk about the problems that exist between you. If youre going to resolve issues, there needs to be a mutual commitment to listen to the other persons concerns and to work towards improving the situation. Dont corner your spouse with an unexpected lecture, but set a time and agree to start to work through your issues.Be prepared. Before you have the talk, take the time separately to think through the unresolved issues that youll be discussing. What are your concerns in the relationship? In what areas do you feel you need to improve? What are your expectations of your spouse? To put your thoughts down on paper may be best, but either way, be prepared to be open and honest with each other about the real issues between you. Be sure to take the time to really listen to what your spouse is saying. Give each other uninterrupted time to share your view on things.Be direct but gentle. Neither of you has anything to gain by holding back your true feelings. Remember: unresolved issues lie at the heart of emotional detachment. So lay all your cards out on the table by sharing your hurts clearly. Dont allow things to get out of hand. Be committed to talk through things sensibly. Take breaks to cool it if necessary but agree to continue. Ask each other the tough questions, and talk through the difficult issues that have been eating away at your relationship. Regardless of which partner initiated the wrong, you both need to work at resolving the problem.Begin to meet unmet needs. Often a person pulls back from the relationship because, in their mind, their needs are not being met. A healthy marriage demands that both partners actively work to discern the needs of their spouse, and work to meet those needs. Seek to understand your spouses needs and ask yourself how you can start to better express love by meeting these needs. Make your spouse and sorting things out your new priority.Deal with your own stuff. If I am feeling abandoned by my spouse, I need to ask myself a tough question: What have I done to drive my spouse away? Now it may not be only your responsibility. Nevertheless, you have to find out what you are responsible for and take ownership for your actions. Really listen to your spouse. Of course, there are things that your mate needs to deal with, and they may be withdrawing from you for selfish reasons, but that cant stop you from taking the steps that you know you need to take. Both parties must be prepared to make apologies and extend forgiveness as part of your recovery from the emotional detachment.Intentionally re-engage. If you are to re-establish your emotional connection, it wont happen by accident and it wont happen overnight. You need to agree to make your relationship a priority and spend some quality time together. Plan a few dates and put each other in your schedules. Its time to re-enter one anothers lives again.Act kindly. This may not be a revolutionary new idea, but it can have that kind of an effect on your marriage. You must act kindly toward your spouse. Small gestures of warmth, acts of kindness, and efforts to rekindle the romance between you will go a long way toward renewing your bond with one another. Do this from the heart with real commitment to make the necessary changes.Love unconditionally. Somebody has to break out of the negative cycle of eye-for an eye, poor treatment for poor treatment. You need to step out of the insult-for-insult cycle and respond differently. You cannot control your spouses behaviour, but you can control your own. Regardless of how your spouse responds, you must choose to treat them with love. This is not easy to do when your partner is not reciprocating, but it is what you vowed to do when you promised to love each other for better or for worse. And nothing breaks down emotional barriers like unconditional love.Thanks for the A2A, Anon, and best wishes. :)'

S' It is thanks to the Refractory period (sex).An increased infusion of the hormone oxytocin during ejaculation is believed to be chiefly responsible for the male refractory period.[5] Another chemical which is considered to be responsible for the male refractory period is prolactin,[1][6] which represses dopamine, which is responsible for sexual arousal.[6] It is additionally proposed that the gonadotropin inhibitory hormone (GnIH), which is considered to inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and sexual functions causes refractoriness of the post-ejaculatory refractory period.[8] This hypothesis also supports the increase of oxytocin and prolactin after orgasm in accordance with the previous studies.[8]In short, your body produces a lot of chemical signals to say, slow down.

S' I realize a point is being made here about weight, but I hope to point out that both pictures being posted are of women who are:of Caucasian descentblonde (as a side note, both Marilyn* and Candice* were originally brunettes- surveys have found that UK men tend to prefer blonde women, women brunette [1])in their 20sposing in a manner that\'s sexually provocativestyled, lighted, posed, and in the latter case, photoshopped*It\'s a very heterosexual, male, caucasian, and western-centric ideal. This takes the relevance out of the question, unfortunately. There is an underlying assumption of what all cultures and all nations find uniformly ideal that is mistaken to begin with.But to answer the main question: There certainly exists a biological and sociological basis for a culture\'s preferred ideal form of beauty of the time- biological points to a woman\'s fertility, her WHR (both Marilyn and Candice have an ideal WHR of close to 0.7), the smoothness and clarity of her skin, her facial and body symmetry, her age, her hair, her nails, and so forth. Sociological would be height, skin colour, neck length, foot size, body hair, and plenty of extraneous decorations involving piercings, plates, tattoos, keloid scars, velvet moles, cork cheeks, blackened teeth, sharpened teeth, and mouse-skin eyebrows. And so forth.And then there are some which are in between- weight, I think, is one of them. There have also been studies to show that the preference for weight fluctuates according to men\'s states, or even that of the economy:Why Stressed-Out Men Prefer Heavier Women | TIME.comPlayboy Playmate Curves and the State of the EconomyDemand Curves: Playmate Economics - The New York TimesSo if you go by those studies, as men grow wealthier, they prefer thinner women. On the other hand, the Tang dynasty of China famously favoured buxom, heavier ladies. It was also "the most glistening historic period in China\'s history", so who knows for certain?[1] How men and women have totally opposing views of perfect faceBody ideals from around the world revealed in new photoshop experiment(Yes, I realize they\'re from the Dailyfail, but it\'s interesting nonetheless.)'

The time to do right by yourself and others is always now. If I were you, I'd make it clear. At its worst, the relationship takes on a new dimension that's slightly awkward. At best, you eventually work your way towards each other and start a new life. After all, you both appear to be mobile to some degree, and there is no telling if those moves reverse in the future.

S' I believe, it is in the loneliness you speak to yourself !In my childhood days I used to be an introvert kid and therefore for the obvious reasons not at all popular. I used to be that plain vanilla boy who would sit in the middle benches of his class room and would endure the urgency of using washroom for hours but couldnt stand up and seek permission from teacher.  The times I broke my silence was when I had any emotional rush...Which was usually when I was hurt over someones remark or teasing.Yes I was like one of those shy classmate of yours.. whom you fail to recognize every time you see your old class photograph.I continued to be this till I was about 10-11 years oldMe and my family went to my grandparents place ( about 700 km far ) every summer. It was the 12th summer of my life when I was at my grannys village. I went along my father and few of his friends for an evening walk in the farmlands. After walking a few kilometers out of the village, I was exhausted. My father advised me to wait for him under the banyan tree beside the lake, the spot which we crossed few minutes before, as it is safe, till he comes back.I agreed and headed towards the tree.Exhausted as hell, I lied on my back and started watching the sky which was changing its colors towards the darker shades of orange and within few minutes the stars came out.This was the first time in my life I was all aloneall left to myself.No human soul around for a at least a km. My mind started bouncing over stuff which my eyes could look on, stones, frogs, lake, stars, moon, sky and finally landed on myself.I thought about my incapability of expressing oneself, and through the past experience somehow concluded that it is not good for me and from that day on I decided to express myself freely.And succeeded in doing so in few years!Many things (both good and bad) might not have happened had I remained that plain vanilla boy!Many years from that lone reddish dusk under the tree, I now again find myself all alone in a luxurious hotel. And more than the comforts of the hotel, Im enjoying my loneliness which again had made me realize that I talk too much and therefore should try to speak as little and concise as possible.A yet another life changing lesson!I think it is in the loneliness you speak to yourself !And me suggested me to be a spectator of life and not a commentator !'

When your 'Crush', crushes you : Shit 1.0So you are busy shopping,with a peppy and festive mood,in your enchanting city of lakes,enjoying yourself and the evening,when you happen to eye-lock your childhood crush,in midst of a huge crowd,in about a decade,with a serene smile on her face,dimensions in time and length, both cease to exist,andyour heart starts punching itself with arbitrary torques,mind visits the isolated islands of past memories andthe bees & butterflies which you thought were dead by now,too visit their old den : your poor belly!And all these hammer you, after a good long period of 10 years, since your eyes last saw her pretty faceThe lover-cum-warrior inside you, tries to fight back, with the sword of maturity which had been earned over the past few years and finally succeeds in passing a dry smile.By which she is amused and returns a Do I know you? Bhaiya ! look.Your Eyes, like a culprit seem to be accustomed of this treatment ( probably a genetic curse or a godly boon ! ), almost in flash jumps onto a dummy next to her clad with the new and stylish HI brand bra.Counting every passing second, you move out of her site, admiring the semi naked figure !You remain nostalgic for the rest of the evening and almost the whole night, trying to sketch her portrait from the shades of the past.Kaleidoscope of memories starts rolling showcasing your movie in Eastman Colors.Reminding youOf the times you used to cruse through the sea of student after the end-bell of your school, much like a Spartan of 300 against the army of Zerksis, to acquire a seat for her beside yourself, so you could enjoy her aura for the awesome-st 15 minute ride to home.Of the time you gathered all the courage, as much as a 14 year lad could, to express you liking to her, and utter I LOVE YOU. in a span of about a minute and read the change of expressions on her face, to hurriedly add DIDI, making a fool of yourself in front of her !Whence you land into reality, you curse yourself for not walking upto her and making up any move.After thinking your brains out for the whole morning, finally you stumble upon a solution to lighten your guilt.Dedicating the incident a Life event status on face-book. ( After all we are the social-network generation ! )That awkward moment you happened to eye-lock your childhood crush in the midst of a crowd in about almost a decade and she couldnt recognize you! #BeardedInBhopalAnd tiredly returned to bed ( feeling a little better ) for the rest of the dayNow when you woke up and opened your Facebook account you noticed her like amongst the other 40+ likes and your mind whirls upside down, and within a second you received a ping from her:She: Hey I too spotted you, yesterday in the Mall, thought your where looking over someone !(Shit 1 : Assuming that she has made out about YOU LIKING HER )Me: It took me a hell of a time to decide how should I react! I know I made an Epic Fool of Myself, in front of you. Actually I regretted a lot for not coming up-to you for a chat, yesterday! And it resulted in the status! You did a great favor to me by not commenting But I spotted you at my status. Anyways Hows Life?She: Oh that status was for me?? Now Im surprised(Shit 2 : Feeling Naked and so vulnerable that you ask her out at that very  moment )Me: Actually I couldnt react When I saw you.. May be the bees and butterflies from the past erupted in my belly Anyways I might be pushing my luck too much here but still Will you be free any time on Mon or Tues or later, for a coffee etc ?? And above is not at all obligatory ! To which she replied None.(Shit 3 :  You are still waiting.  Either for her reply.  or  Your courage, to come to your rescue)AndYou Remain A FOR EVER ALONE !P.S : Later I found out that she got married a week after this conversation and probably was shopping for the same, when I spotted her.

S' "Gorapan"orFairness of skinAs crazy as it sounds, fairness is considered beautiful, sweet, cleanin India! A typical matrimonial advertisement here would read  looking for fair, slim and tall professional for fair, slim and homely girl (age: 24). When a baby is born in India, the first question from the inquisitive aunt is Is she/he fair?. Not, Is the baby healthy and doing fine?. Sad but true.The fairness cream market in India alone is bumping up to $500 million, with healthy growth rates of 12-15% per year. This means every brand from the local to international ones such as Nivea, Loreal,P&G, J&J and others are players. Hindustan Unilever is the market leader with a 70% market share, promoting the popular Fair & Lovely cream. Note that if you are fair, by association, you are lovely. A clever product naming strategy that has obviously worked for them.While there is a definite inclination towards the female Indian, more recently, mens fairness has also opened up  with Bollywood stars like Shah Rukh Khan (for Fair and Handsome!), Shahid Kapoor and John Abraham endorsing mens skin whitening products. Whats good for the goose is good for the gander, I guess.Here is an infographic that I found on the website of Emami (makers of Fair & Handsome promoted by Shah Rukh Khan) that explained why men need fair skin (dont miss the Womens). This is so tacky and wacky, its hard to figure out whether to laugh or cry! Just in case you think this has to be a joke, heres the link to that page. The latest odd product extension for this already nauseating market is what I heard on TV the other day. It was a commercial for, get this, a fairness deodorant! In other words, dont just smell nice under your arms, get fair and lovely there too. I call this taking things a bit too far.

Death was a strange experience for Bihari. His friend, a "lekhpal", (low-level buereaucrat) insisted, "Take a look at this, you are dead". Lal Bihari was quite irritated with his friend as he recently had tea with him a few weeks before. It took Lal Bihari 18 years to get his life and his land back. During that time, he added the word Mritak, or Dead, to his name and to prove that he was living sought arrest, tried to run for parliament, kidnapped the son of the uncle who had stolen his property, threatened murder, insulted judges, threw leaflets listing his complaints at legislators in the state assembly and demanded a widow\'s pension for his wife.

S' Undoubtedly Christopher NolanBecause Nolan has mastered the art of turning mindless entertainment into something that requires you to think. All his films, even the early and underrated "Memento," are like an intricate painting. They are beautifully crafted and involve layers upon layers of meaning, and ultimately the viewer can interpret it any number of different ways. It\'s impossible to leave the theater without arguing about whether or not what you saw really just happened. His ideas are so fresh and so well put together that it\'s impossible not to take notice. Everyone knows him now as the man that forever changed the superhero genre but there\'s so much more to him than that. He takes film-making and turns it on its ear. He takes genre blending to a whole new level. With "Inception," he creates an exciting action movie that\'s also a heist, a psychological thriller, a touching story of redemption all encapsulated in the world of dreams. And it\'s up to you to decide what\'s a dream and what\'s reality. Even before the twist-at-the-end trend started to get old, he wrote and directed "Memento," showed the movie in reverse and put the twist at the beginning. When he released "Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight" he turned colorful caricatures into complex personalities. With "The Prestige," he grabbed your attention the way a magician enthralls a child and his subtle sleight of hand tricked us anyway even though we know better. He\'s constantly reinventing the Blockbuster and actually creates something you could never have imagined. And he does it so well that it\'s impossible to decide which is better: the idea or the execution.His movies take me anywhere from the heights of Gotham to the depths of the human subconscious. If there\'s nothing else that\'s certain, you can be sure that when Nolan asks you "Are you watching closely?" he means it.'

S' Short answerLong answerThere are very few characters in literature,who instill pride and inspiration in common folks. Abhimanyu is surely one such character.The Chakravyuha or Padmavyuha was a special formation and knowledge of how to penetrate it was limited to only a handful of Pandava warriors, namely Abhimanyu, Arjuna, Krishna and Pradyumna.However, to the Pandavas\' disappointment, Pradyumna, son of Krishna, chose not to participate in the Kurukshetra war. Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna, knew how to penetrate the Padmavyuha but not how to exit it, leading to tragic consequencesThe thirteenth day of Mahabharat war is remembered for the construction of Chakravyuha by Dronacharya.By the inspiration of Duryodhan, Drona chalked out a plan to trap Yudhisthira the main lead of the Pandavas and hence win the war at one sweep.Dronacharya knew that Arjun and Sri Krishna had the skill of penetration and exit through Chakravyuh so both of them were purposefully drawn in to a separate battle with the Samsaptakas.Now the challenge of the Chakravyuh was sent over to the Pandavas\' side.As planned Yudhisthir had no other option of himself accepting the challenge as the Krishna and Arjun were busy in a battle far away from head quarters, hence inaccessible.To his aid came young Abhimanyu.He knew, he has only the partial knowledge of Padmavyuh, but to a brave kshatriya like him, fulfilling his Dharma of protecting his King is must.He also had confidence (may be over confidence) and hope of winning the vyuh with the help of his mighty uncles.But Kauravas with the help of Jayadratha were successful in hindering four of the five pandavas from entering the chakravyuha (by making use of a boon granted to him by Lord Shiva) and thus brutally killing Abhimanyu in the end,by violating the norms of wars.Abhimanyu though sacrificed his life, was very effective in holding all the Kaurava maharathis (Great Charioteers, colloquially Great Warriors) at bay and thereby preventing the advancement of Kaurava forces towards the Pandavas.Hence avoiding, a certain defeat of his side.Also(as suggested by User)" Abhimanyu was actually the soul of a daitya named Kalyavana. Krishna after burning Kalyavana to death had captured his soul (tied him in a knot of his upper cloth) and taken him to Dwaraka only to stuff him into a cupboard. Ghatotkacha(who had been sent by Hidimba to take care of Subhadra in Dwarka as Pandavas were in the forest.) saw Krishna and got a scolding from him. He went and reported the matter to Subhadra who went downstairs to check. She opened the cupboard and a light entered her womb which caused her to fall unconscious. This was the main reason why Krishna divulged only half the secret of Chakravyuha to Abhimanyu when he was in the womb." Cogito Ergo Sum'

S" Human life an be divided into 4 stages,Birth to Puberty, PubertySexually active life andAging and finishing through transferring experiences with intelligence in wisdom.In stage 1 intuition gets its foundations, and grows extremely fast. In puberty sex takes complete power.During sexually active life, mostly abstract knowledge increases (standstill of intelligence). A waste of creativity.In the last stage intuition MIGHT take over again (at present mostly doesn't), and CAN still grow considerably. Celibacy was invented to keep intelligence can work in decreasing the role of sex and improve gathering knowledge. But then both mind and body should 'forget' completely about sex.There can be other ways to keep abstract intelligence growing."

S' The popular book and movie The Secret has a simple message which it calls the Law of Attraction. The message is that whatever you think about (wealth, or poverty, happiness or misery, love or isolation) the universe will deliver to you. You attract to yourself that which you imagine.This message has a clear appeal. It offers a one-size-fits-all solution to life\'s large and small problems. All of them.Part of me thinks The Secret holds valuable truth. If I am caught in a traffic jam, I have a choice. I can increase my stress level by thinking about how angry I am or I can decrease my stress level by imagining a clear road home. There are benefits of thinking such relaxing thoughts: I feel happier in the moment and I avoid the wear and tear that stress puts on my body. In a more relaxed frame of mind, I am probably also more likely to notice and appreciate a break in the traffic ("ah! a wonderfully clear road, just as I imagined.") than I would be in the stressed frame of mind ("finally I have two inches of driving room, dang it. I\'ve waited long enough.") These benefits of positive thinking are supported by sound empirical evidence. But The Secret takes the power of positive thinking far beyond the evidence. Its claim is that your thoughts cause the things that happen to you. If you think about a clear road home, the universe will deliver it to you. If you think about an empty parking space, the universe will manifest one in front of your car. If you think about having an income of $100,000, you shall have it. A beautiful wife? That too.The law of attraction, sadly, is not only a causal claim; it might be an unfalsifiable one.Consider this: what if you don\'t get what you want after thinking and thinking about thinking about it? Does that prove that The Secret doesn\'t work? No, because maybe didn\'t think enough about it, or you thought too many negative thoughts, or you didn\'t give the universe enough time to deliver it to you.Yet why let the absence of proof stop me when The Secret offers infinite benefits? Why not follow Pascal\'s famous rationale for believing in God: if there is any chance that God is real, I have much more to gain by believing in him than I have to lose by not believing. Similarly with the Law of Attraction.My reason for continued skepticism about The Secret is a moral and philosophical one. Instead of just dishonest, The Secret may be downright destructive.Marketed as a revelation of ancient wisdom that has traveled down the ages, The Secret is instead a re-interpretation of ancient wisdom through strikingly contemporary eyes. I have written before about the problems with our culture\'s privileging of optimism and positive emotions and its refusal to acknowledge suffering. The Secret promotes these cultural preferences along with a claim that the individual can have limitless control over his own destiny.The Secret\'s claims are attractive indeed, but instead of promoting the kinds of attitudes and capacities that adults need in order to live lives that are full, integrated, and mature, The Secret promotes a relationship between the individual and the world that is akin to a glorified infancy.When we were infants, we relied on our caregivers to meet all of our needs. If we were lucky, our caregivers mostly did meet our needs. In no case, though, can a caregiver read an infant\'s mind. As everyone who has ever been a parent - or an infant - knows, parents\' inability to mind-read is alone responsible for plenty of unnecessary tears and suffering. In virtually no case does a caregiver give an infant everything he or she wants. In virtually no case are the infant\'s desires the only causes of the events in his or her life.The Secret promises that if we can learn to ask and receive, then the Universe can be the idealized parent we never had - a parent who can read our minds and provide us with everything we want.Be careful what you wish for. In his recent book, Stumbling on Happiness, Dan Gilbert cleverly and comically argues that we spend much time trying to provide for our future selves the things that we think they will want, only to find our future selves ungrateful and disappointed. On the flip side, we end up happy with things we never thought we wanted. As adolescents, we may have shuddered at the thought of ending up as ordinary, boring adults. When we become ordinary, boring adults, those ordinary, boring things like buying a house and having children are milestones more meaningful than our adolescent selves with their limited vision could have imagined.I\'m not sure I want total control over my future. If we really could plan our future lives for our future selves, this would gut our lives\' journeys of the experiences that make us grow and develop as people.What about empathy? The worst part of the Law of Attraction is that is discourages the kinds of practices that can help the most isolated and miserable among us feel some relief from suffering. Among the most trans formative and healing moments in psychotherapy are those in which the therapist can step into the client\'s pain - can share in it for a time - so that the client feels another\'s understanding, compassionate presence and feels not so alone. This empathic process requires the therapist to be willing to actively imagine and be impacted by the client\'s painful reality. This process is also powerful when one\'s friends and loved ones can do it. What happens to this kind of empathy if we believe that our futures are shaped by the negative things we imagine?Source http://thesunnygirl.com'

S' Suppose that you were on your way to meet two close friends. Will you feel anxious or afraid of the meeting?Of course you wont but what if you were going to deliver a presentation in front of 100 persons that you dont know, wont you be afraid?Yes you will only be afraid if you have doubts about your ability to handle the presentation.We fear the future when we have doubts about our ability to handle future events.In the first instance this might look like something that is out of our hands but on careful observation you will find that we fear the future because we ignore getting prepared on intention.For example if you are afraid not to find a job then this means that you feel that you are not that prepared for the job market. In order to kill that fear you must take actions that help you become reassured that you are well prepared (like taking additional courses, learning new skills, writing a good CV....etc)The main reason people remain afraid of the future is that they never dare to respond to their fears by taking actions but instead they ignore the warnings and try to forget about them.As long as you ignore the sources of your fears your subconscious mind will let them grow in order to draw your attention to them once again. You dont need a miracle to get rid of the fear of the future but you just need to:Listen to the messages and understand them: Once you start listening to your subconscious mind you will understand its concerns and you will have a clue about the actions you should take in order to kill the fearsListening is not enough: Some people listen well but do nothing about the things they listen to. Its the same as sitting with a friend every few days who reminds you of your fears then leave without helping you. Listening is only one part of the solution but the complete salvation lies in taking actions right after you listen to the problemBeware of self deception : Some people try to find an excuse for not taking actions by deceiving themselves. The popular examples of self deception are claiming that you dont have time, that you are happy with what you have while you are not or by trying to convince yourself that you are helpless in order to escape the responsibility!! Getting rid of the fear of the future is no rocket science, become brave enough to listen to your fears then take powerful actions to reassure yourself that you can handle them.Source The Ultimate Source for Understanding Yourself and others'

S' Hanuman in the flag signifies sense control and mind control that gives victory to the higher nature over the lower nature. Hanuman and MahabharataHanuman is Chiranjeevi - one who lives forever. Thus even as various eras passed by Hanuman was ever-present. He was also told that Lord Sriram would reappear as Lord Krishna at a future time. Thus Hanuman appears in the Mahabharata at two junctures - once to quell the pride of Bheema and the second time to see Lord Krishna. Bheema was the brother of Hanuman in the sense that Bheema was also born as a result of a boon from Vayudeva. Once when the Pandava\'s were resting in the forest, a heavenly flower by name Sugandikapushpa floated through the air into the lap of Draupadi. Totally enchanted by its beauty and fragrance she asked Bheema to get some more flowers for her. Thus Bheema went in the direction in which the flower had flown. He found it in a lake belonging to Gandharvas (the court musicians of Lord Indra), after a fierce battle he was able to obtain the flowers. Thus triumphantly, Bheema headed back, proud of his strength. On his way back he found an aged monkey blocking his path, since it was the custom not to cross a living person, Bheema, his thoughts still swollen with pride, called out loud to the monkey to clear the path. The feeble monkey told him that it was too tired, it requested the powerful warrior to move it\'s tail aside. An arrogant Bheema could not budge the tail though he tried with all his might. Realizing his folly he apologized to the monkey. Seeing his arrogance quelled, the monkey returned to its original form; it was none other than Lord Hanuman who had come to subdue the pride of his brother.Hanuman told Bheema, after the above-mentioned incident that he would appear on the flag of Arjuna\'s chariot. But I will relate the second story because it is here that Hanuman actually meets Lord Krishna. In an argument between Hanuman and Arjuna, Arjuna claimed that he could reconstruct the bridge built by the Vanar army during Lord Sriram\'s war with Ravana using his archery skills. Hanuman laid the challenge that if Arjuna could build a bridge that could withstand his weight, let alone an army\'s, then he would be on the flag of Arjuna\'s chariot in the war. But should Arjuna fail it was decided that Arjuna would give up his life by entering a pyre. Arjuna built a bridge in a jiffy and when Hanuman stepped on it the whole bridge collapsed, Arjuna, immensely disappointed decided to end his life. At this moment Lord Krishna appeared and asked Arjuna to build the bridge again. After Arjuna rebuilt the bridge, Lord Krishna touched the bridge and asked Hanuman to walk over it. Despite his best efforts Hanuman could not break the bridge; at this instant Hanuman saw Lord Sriram in Krishna and was overcome with emotion. He promised to aid Arjuna in the war by being on the flag of Arjuna\'s chariot, thus stabilising and protecting it. Hanumanjis flag signifies sense control and mind control that gives victory to the higher nature over the lower nature.Arjuna\'s Chariot bursts into flames:At the conclusion of the war (Shalya Parva), as soon as Lord Krishna and Lord Hanuman exit Arjunas chariot, the chariot, along with the horses, instantly catches flames.The Mahabharata, Book 9: Shalya Parva, chapter 62:Keshava, addressed the wielder of gandiva, saying, "Take down thy gandiva as also the two inexhaustible quivers. I shall dismount after thee, O best of the Bharatas! Get thee down, for this is for thy good, O sinless one!"Pandu\'s brave son Dhananjaya did as he was directed. The intelligent Krishna, abandoning the reins of the steeds, then dismounted from the car of Dhananjaya. After the high-souled Lord of all creatures had dismounted from that car, the celestial Ape that topped the mantle of Arjuna\'s vehicle, disappeared there and then. The top of the vehicle, which had before been burnt by Drona and Karna with their celestial weapons, quickly blazed forth to ashes, O king, without any visible fire having been in sight. Indeed, the car of Dhananjaya, with its quick pairs of steeds, yoke, and shaft, fell down, reduced to ashes.Beholding the vehicle thus reduced to ashes, O lord, the sons of Pandu became filled with wonder, and Arjuna, O king, having saluted Krishna and bowed unto him, said these words, with joined hands and in an affectionate voice, \'O Govinda, O divine one, for what reason hath this car been consumed by fire? What is this highly wonderful incident that has happened before our eyes! O thou of mighty arms, if thou thinkest that I can listen to it without harm, then tell me everything.\'Vasudeva said, \'That car, O Arjuna, had before been consumed by diverse kinds of weapons. It was because I had sat upon it during battle that it did not fall into pieces, O scorcher of foes! Previously consumed by the energy of brahmastra, it has been reduced to ashes upon my abandoning it after attainment by thee of thy objects!\'On Rahul Kawadkar\'s Suggestion"Each attack by Arjun was pushing back Karna\'s chariot by ten paces while each Karna\'s attack was pushing Arjun\'s chariot by two paces. Throughout this duel, Krishna kept praising Karna saying "Bahut Khoob, Karna." Arjun got peeved with Krishna because he thought he was doing better than Karna. Krishna said "Your chariot is being driven by me, Vishwaroopam and has Lord Hanuman on your flag protecting it. Pushing back your chariot even slightly is an impossible task with us two deities protecting it. In spite of that, Karna is pushing it back with every attack."Decided the outcome of duel in a way.

S" It depends on the bean and how it's used.If your bean is very likely to be required the instant the server comes online, then initializing it during startup is probably the best bet since the server would be unable to do much work without it.If your bean is very lightweight, e.g., its initialization consists only of letting Spring do dependency injection, then there's little harm initializing it at startup; doing so will make the system's behavior somewhat easier to reason about and easier to debug, and will minimize overhead.However, if you have a bean that's expensive to initialize and that is only used occasionally, especially if it's only used in a non-interactive context like processing batch jobs, lazy initialization may be the right call. In that case the server can begin doing other work right away, and you won't pay the cost of initializing the bean in question until it's actually needed.Lazy initialization comes with overhead such as the use of proxy objects that wouldn't otherwise be needed, so it shouldn't be used ubiquitously if you care at all about efficiency. But the cost will be spread out over time instead of all occurring before the server can do any work. Depending on your application, that may be the correct tradeoff to make.These principles are broadly applicable to lazy initialization as a general concept, not Spring in particular, though obviously the low-level details will differ."

S' With around 30 countries in my travel history, mostly visited solo but occasionally with guides, I\'ve found I don\'t enjoy guided visits more than I enjoy the ones I do on my own or with a traveling companion. The experience with a guide is different, no question, but to me it\'s no better or worse on balance. I learn more in some respects and less in other respects. There\'s less frustration with a guide handling things, but for the same reason there\'s less sense of adventure and accomplishment.It\'s not just about itinerary flexibility, though I have yet to meet a guide who\'s well-suited to my preferred travel style of, "That street looks interesting -- let\'s go walk down it and see what\'s there" where there is literally no itinerary at all and I\'m just kind of taking each day as it comes and moving on to the next place whenever I feel like it.By virtue of the guide knowing what they\'re doing, guided trips remove the possibility of screwing up and doing dumb things out of ignorance, which, while rarely pleasant in the moment, often turns into some of the best stories after the fact. Traveling with a guide also adds pressure to be in social interaction mode all day long every day, which becomes increasingly exhausting and stressful for introverts like me as a trip progresses. Often I want to walk around looking at my surroundings without talking to anyone.I\'ll sometimes go on 1-day guided tours of particular places when I travel, especially special-interest tours where I would have a hard time making the arrangements on my own. For example, in Buenos Aires earlier this year I went on a guided street-art tour where the guide knew a bunch of the local artists and took us to meet some of them and watch them work. That kind of thing is hard to do without local help. But to me that\'s distinct from just hiring a general-purpose local guide to take me around.That said, there are some places that are impractical (if not impossible) to visit without a guide, and I\'ll use one in those cases. For example, if I\'d tried to do a solo visit to North Korea instead of a guided one, you would probably be reading news stories about my imprisonment!'

S'  makes much more sense to me as the character for "tear" than . Water + eye = teardrop. Water + door + dog = a wet dog entering the house? (Though as John Renfroe notes in his comment, the right side of the traditional character is actually a phonetic component, not a semantic one.)But "inferior" is totally subjective and depends on which criteria you personally consider important. Simplified characters are often faster and easier to write, so if that\'s important to you, then lots of them will seem superior to their traditional counterparts. It\'s much easier to write (and learn!)  than , for example.If, on the other hand, your favorite thing about Chinese characters is intricacy and complexity, simplification will almost never be an improvement.'

S' Even today you don\'t have to search too hard on the Internet to find humans who are sexually attracted to nonhuman organisms of all different shapes and sizes. It\'s almost certain that at least a handful of the billions of members of the human race would find just about any kind of alien a sexual turn-on. Those people might be considered sexual deviants by most of humanity, but the attraction would still exist.The "mutual" part would depend on the aliens. For one thing, it would require that they reproduce sexually; if they have no ability to feel sexual attraction at all, then by definition they couldn\'t be mutually attracted to humans. But it\'s not too hard to imagine sexually-reproducing aliens that have the same kinds of variance in individual taste that humans do, which would mean a greater-than-zero chance of mutual attraction with a human.Mutual attraction gets more likely the more physically similar the aliens are to humans, and gets a huge boost if there\'s some means by which actual reproduction is possible (it\'s no wonder there are so many half-humans running around in the "Star Trek" universe!) but I don\'t think even extreme physical differences would cause the probability to drop to zero.'

S' Probably not. One reason is that many characters have more than one pronunciation, so you\'d have to either choose just one (which would mean either flat-out not listing the others or having multiple glyphs for the same Chinese character, which in turn would mean you could no longer use any of the standard Chinese encoding systems to locate characters in your font) or list them all and use such tiny pinyin that it\'d be basically unreadable. For example, the character  can be read xng, hng, hng, hng, or heng depending on context, and it\'s not a matter of, "One normal pronunciation and a bunch of obscure ones you wouldn\'t have to learn." The first two of those are both very commonly used.The target market is really pretty narrow -- this wouldn\'t be useful to anyone except beginning learners of Chinese, and even then, for educational materials you\'ll typically want to format the pinyin separately from the characters anyway so as to have proper word spacing. The correct pinyin for  is "pngyu" and not "png yu," but if the Latin characters were attached to the Chinese ones, you\'d have no ability to control that spacing.However, it should be possible to take an existing Chinese font and write software to alter it based on the pronunciations from a Chinese dictionary. As far as I know, nobody has yet done so.'

S' Singapore has a lot to recommend it, at least from the point of view of a foreigner who\'s looking for an Asian location.

S' Viktor Toth\'s answer covers a bunch of general principles. Another one is to look at performance from the top down.What I mean by that: say you have some code that searches a large data set and it\'s too slow. You can do a bunch of profiling (and that\'s almost always the right place to start) and discover that a particular inner loop is where you\'re spending most of your time. You might focus your efforts on making that small chunk of code run as fast as it possibly can. In a lot of cases this kind of targeted optimization can get you some impressive speedups, and when people talk about optimization this is usually the kind of thing they mean.But it should be the last step of your optimization process, not the first. Before you look at that inner loop, ask yourself if all the work the code is doing is even required by the user. For example, maybe you only need to search 10% of the items with an estimate of how many additional search results there are. Boom, massive speedup. This kind of falls under the principle, "The fastest code is the code that never needs to run at all."After that, see if the approach you\'re taking is the best one. For example, maybe you\'re using an O(n) algorithm where an O(n log n) one would also work. No amount of inner-loop optimization will beat switching to a lower order of complexity for a sufficiently large input. Your profiling data is still useful here, though, in that it\'ll tell you which of the O(n) algorithms in your code are actually causing problems; algorithms that run in polynomial time are perfectly fine if the inputs are guaranteed to be small.Only after you\'ve ensured that you need to do the work at all, that you\'ve identified the source of the performance problem, and that you\'re not choosing algorithms that are slow by nature, should you dive into language-specific micro-optimizations. You\'ve probably seen the Knuth quote about premature optimization (even though it\'s usually quoted out of context). Answering the high-level questions is how you know when little fiddly kinds of optimization are no longer premature.'

S' None of them. All of them.It\'s a really unfortunate development that so many schools are emphasizing "design patterns" as if they\'re some of the most important concepts in all of computer science, churning out students who have been trained to think of software development as a matter of repeatedly throwing chapters from the Gang of Four book at a problem until a working solution emerges.To be clear: I am not criticizing the person who asked this question. I am criticizing the education systems that caused the question to seem relevant to, at the time I\'m writing this answer, 23 people. (Going nuts over design patterns seems to be more common in some countries than in others, but it happens everywhere.)Here\'s the deal with design patterns that is probably not obvious to someone who has learned them as if they are first principles in software development. They are observations, not rules. People noticed that programmers seemed to be approaching problems in similar ways in a bunch of different applications, and they decided that it would be pretty useful to be able to talk about those approaches using a common vocabulary so they wouldn\'t have to keep explaining what they were referring to. So they figured out general versions of these common practices and gave them names like "Visitor" and "Observer."There is value in studying common practices and common metaphors; in much the same way a good musician listens to a lot of other people\'s music and mentally picks it apart to learn why it\'s good, a skilled programmer should read a lot of other people\'s code and figure out what\'s good about it. If a bunch of smart people are solving a certain class of problem in a certain way, you should understand why they\'re doing it that way, not least because the solution might be one you hadn\'t thought of yourself.But the important part is "understand why." The skill you need to cultivate to become a good developer and to be attractive to the kinds of companies in the question isn\'t plugging together objects from a library of canned formulas, but rather understanding the reasoning behind them deeply enough that, when faced with the same problem, you will arrive at the same solution on your own. And much more importantly, when faced with a similar but not identical problem, you will do something else rather than try to shoehorn the solution into an existing design pattern that\'s an awkward fit.It\'s on that last point where the schools I criticize at the start of this answer really fail, and the result is gigabytes of horrific code (usually enterprise software) that\'s a teetering Jenga tower of generic implementations of popular design patterns stacked one on top of the other, resulting in software so complex and designs so obfuscated with unnecessary indirection that no developer can hold the entire logic in their head at once. There are plenty of jobs out there writing and maintaining that kind of pile-of-design-patterns software, but they don\'t tend to be at companies like Google.'

S' Starting with Portal or any other game that plays like a first-person shooter might be a mistake for a couple reasons. First, the controls are likely to be frustrating for someone who has absolutely no experience coordinating mouse movement with the direction of movement and view. Second, a significant percentage of people experience motion sickness from first-person-perspective games. This often diminishes with repeated exposure, but you don\'t want your friend\'s first gaming experience to be literally nausea-inducing.The first question I\'d ask would be whether your friend plays any games that aren\'t computerized, e.g., board or card games. If so, those will give you a great entry point: start with a game that\'s like one of those, but slightly enhanced. There are hundreds of "Solitaire with powerups" kinds of games out there, e.g., Fairway Solitaire. If he plays games such as Risk, a 4X game would likely hold his interest. The Civilization series is one possibility depending on how much complexity you think he can deal with.If he doesn\'t play any games at all in real life but likes puzzles, there are tons of puzzle games to choose from, e.g., Monument Valley.Barring that, your Telltale idea is a decent one. Those games are heavily story-driven and emotionally engaging. The only concern I\'d have is that if he thinks games are childish, stories about zombies and werewolves might not do a lot to change his mind. To the Moon might be a better choice in that case.Another option is something abstract like Osmos, with no story and no characters, just simple shapes.In general I\'d look to the casual game space rather than the kinds of games hardcore gamers usually play; casual games are designed from the ground up to be highly accessible and generally make far fewer assumptions about one\'s existing experience or skill.'

S" Yes, because it reduces my ability to make use of Quora's social features. Being anonymous cripples Quora a little bit for everyone else.If a question or answer is good, I may want to follow you in the hopes you'll continue to write things I find interesting.If a question or answer is awful, I may want to mute you to stop you from reducing the average quality of my Quora feed in the future.When you're anonymous, I can't do either thing, so you've made Quora less functional for me, and I dislike people making Quora less functional for me.That said, the inability to follow and mute is not a property of anonymity per se. Quora could add the ability to follow and mute anonymous users in a way that wouldn't reveal their identities. If that ability existed, much of my dislike would go away. But it doesn't currently exist, and I can only form my opinion based on the current state of affairs.In cases where there's a solid reason for anonymity, e.g., revealing information about people or companies or governments that would put you in danger, the benefit outweighs the cost. So clearly the anonymity feature serves a valid purpose. But such cases, at least in my feed, seem to be a vanishingly tiny minority of the content that's posted anonymously.Empirically, based on some passes I've done through my feed at various times, I find that over half of the content in my Quora feed that I'd consider noise rather than signal is from anonymous questions. And only about 15-20% of the content I consider worthwhile is from anonymous questions. This is a big enough drag on my feed quality that I actually wrote a browser extension to auto-hide anonymous questions from my feed. Sadly, it triggered Quora's request rate limiting and I haven't had the time and motivation to do the work required to fix that -- maybe someday soon."

S' (Disclaimer: I read the original editions of all three books. It\'s possible that the English translator was allowed to take enough liberties to improve some of the shortcomings.)I\'ve found it well worth reading, but I fear the huge accolades it\'s getting from reviewers will set readers\' expectations too high. Some minor spoilers below but I\'ll try to keep it all pretty vague.The "science" part of the science fiction is intriguing and full of ideas that haven\'t been hammered to death in the genre already. You have to grant him a few specific points of suspension of disbelief, but Liu takes those points and really runs with them. Though he\'s not the first to propose it, his solution to the Fermi Paradox is plausible and well-developed.The "fiction" part doesn\'t fare as well. All but a small handful of the characters are paper-thin, especially in the first book. This gets better as the series goes on, but I had a really hard time connecting with several of the protagonists. There are large stretches of the first and second books where not much happens, which would be fine in a story with engaging characters, but is not so pleasant with dull ones. In several places the story is advanced by extremely convenient coincidences and by characters making massive intuitive leaps that haven\'t been previously hinted at.That said, the story also has some delightful twists and turns, and I often had no idea where it was going to go next. Each of the three books has a hook that makes it pretty unusual, if not unique, in the genre: the Cultural Revolution setting of the first book, the very slowly ticking doomsday clock of the second book, and the migrations in the third book.The non-western cultural perspective has a big impact on the story. From a western reader\'s point of view, this is both for better and for worse. The "better" is largely that the story avoids some of the tropes of western science fiction, and some of the characters have viewpoints and decisionmaking processes one doesn\'t encounter often in western SF. The "worse" is that the story has characters from all over the world, and the non-Chinese characters sometimes act kind of bizarrely, betraying the same kind of lack of understanding that often causes western writers to stumble when they try to write Asian characters. And when the story described the global reaction to certain major events, I found myself having to suspend my disbelief pretty strongly: it\'s hard to imagine there wouldn\'t have been huge numbers of escape attempts in the second and third books, for example.In general I give the series a thumbs up, but don\'t expect it to be the most amazing thing you\'ve ever read.'

S' "Best" is pretty general and I don\'t think any one place deserves that label without qualification. But here are my picks in a few categories:Best natural scenery: Jiuzhaigou. This place is just as stunning as it looks in all the pictures. In autumn the red and yellow leaves on the trees are a delightful contrast to the deep blues and greens of the minerals in the water. I intend to go back in wintertime at some point to see what it\'s like in the ice and snow.Best food: Chengdu. The food is pretty good in a lot of places in China. The best individual restaurants in the country are probably in Beijing and Shanghai. But in Chengdu, unlike those cities, there seems to be very little bad food; everything I had from every mom-and-pop eatery and street vendor and fancy restaurant while I was there was delicious.Best tourism: Beijing. Hard to top the depth and breadth of Chinese history on display in and around this city; the Forbidden City alone takes more than a full day if you really want to see everything. The tourist infrastructure is well-developed and the city has plenty to offer people with all kinds of different interests. Whenever anyone asks me where they should go on their first visit to China, my answer is Beijing.Best place to hang out: Dalian. Dalian doesn\'t have the best scenery, its history has interesting bits (mostly to do with its Russian and Japanese past) but nothing too spectacular, and the food is about average for a city of its size. What it has, though, is a much more relaxed, friendly feel than most other Chinese cities I\'ve visited, plus much less air pollution than other coastal cities and a lot of nice green spaces. It\'s big enough to have all the goods and services you\'d want, but not oppressively huge. If I had to choose any place in China to live, this would almost certainly be my choice. However, I wouldn\'t recommend it as a stop on a tour itinerary since its charms wouldn\'t be apparent in a "stop for 2 days and rush around all day seeing the top tourist attractions" scenario.Of course, I haven\'t been everywhere in China, so maybe there are places I\'d rate higher in all of those categories but just don\'t know about yet.'

S' As of the midseason finale of year two of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., they seem to be going full steam ahead with a version of the Inhumans backstory that follows the comics pretty closely, from the presence of the Kree on ancient Earth to the use of Terrigen Mist to the presence of buried ancient cities.Clearly this has been the plan since long before an Inhumans movie was announced, since it\'s the culmination of a bunch of previously dangling plot threads that were laid out practically from the start of the show.The rights issues between Marvel and other movie studios will necessarily change the details to some degree, e.g., by removing X-Men-style mutants from the equation and (though there\'s some ambiguity here) preventing the use of the Skrull. But the big picture seems to be right in line with the comics.One interesting aspect of this in the context of "how it fits into the MCU" is that, other than a couple prequel comics, it\'s the first instance of one of the non-movie productions setting up backstory for subsequent movies. Previously, the plot points only ever flowed in the opposite direction. I think that\'s a positive development for the long-term health of the MCU: it\'s no longer possible to dismiss the TV side of the universe as a second-fiddle tie-in that never has any impact on the "real" MCU, and cements the vision of the MCU as a single big interconnected whole.'

S' That\'s not quite the right question to ask; here\'s why. Programming languages aren\'t like human languages, with each new one requiring years of effort to reach sufficient fluency to use for work purposes. For the most part if you know a language of a particular style, you can quickly learn any other language of the same style well enough become usefully productive, sometimes in a matter of weeks, even though you won\'t yet have explored all the nooks and crannies. (By "style" I\'m referring to broad families of languages, of which there are several -- but don\'t worry about that for now.)So your goal as a beginning programmer is not to carefully choose the one and only one language you will be stuck using for the rest of your career. Rather, it\'s to establish the fundamentals you\'ll use to pick up whatever language is appropriate for the task at hand.What you should concern yourself with as a beginner is the concepts and the mindset that you\'ll need no matter what language you\'re using, and pretty much any major language will get you there. So you should shoot for whichever language you find most pleasant and find yourself picking up most readily. And that\'ll probably be whichever language has tutorials or books you find most closely suit your learning style.My advice: pick four or five popular languages and Google for beginner tutorials in each. Give each tutorial a few hours of your time and then continue pursuing whichever one you enjoy most or makes you feel like you\'re learning the most. You may end up switching to another language later in your learning process but you\'ll have had a good taste of the pleasure of the craft and will have learned some basics that\'ll help you get a running start later.'

It's what Facebook uses for code review.Play around with Mercurial until you have at least a basic level of proficiency. If you're familiar with git already, it shouldn't be too much work since the two have very similar underlying conceptual models.But in general, don't stress out too much about it.

S' No. Snakes, like other reptiles, are cold-blooded animals, which means they depend on their environment to maintain their body heat. In the wintertime in areas with cold weather, snakes go into a dormant phase called brumation, somewhat similar to the hibernation of various mammal species. They may wake up briefly and emerge from their hiding places to seek water, but aren\'t slithering around looking for people to bite, and will avoid venturing out into the open since the low temperature makes them very slow and vulnerable to predators.Also, snake venom doesn\'t freeze your blood. Neither does any other venom. Such a substance is probably not even physically possible at all, whether natural or artificial.The most popular image that seems to be going around with this "snow snake" meme is a picture of a fake rubber snake.'

S" Not too differently from how it's done in English. The tonal aspect of Mandarin still leaves people with a ton of ability to vary their intonation; it's all about relative changes in intonation in a single syllable or a pair of syllables, rather than like singing a song where you have to get the pitch exactly right or it's off-key.Here's an analogy that might help make it clearer. When you ask a question in English you raise the pitch of the end of the sentence. Are you able to use tone to convey nuances in the last word or two at the end of a question in English, while still raising the pitch enough to make it very clear that the sentence is a question? You probably are, and you probably don't even have to make a conscious effort to do it. It's the same with Mandarin: the language imposes some structure on your intonation but within that structure you still have plenty of room to add all the nuance you want.Since the language's tonality is based on relative changes in intonation within a word, it's also possible to say an entire word or phrase at a higher or lower pitch (but still use the proper tone contours within the word) to convey information.Where it departs from English a little bit, and takes a bit of practice as a learner, is when you use intonation to indicate a question. Broadly, it's still similar to English: a rise in tone at the end turns a sentence into a question. But the syllables at the end of the sentence still need to have their own tones. So what you end up doing is starting from a baseline of a steadily rising intonation and making tone changes relative to that, such that a word that would normally be pronounced with a flat intonation is instead pronounced with a rising one, a word that would normally be pronounced with a rising tone gets a tone that rises much faster than usual, and a word that would normally be pronounced with a falling tone either becomes flat or falls only slightly. When this is done over the course of multiple syllables, it's pretty obvious what's going on and the listener still hears it in terms of the expected per-syllable tone changes.Of course, there are also other ways to include extra information in speech, e.g., changing the speed of your speech, speaking louder or dropping to a whisper, or pausing between words. All of those kinds of things work just as well in Mandarin as in English or any other language.As always, I welcome corrections from native speakers; the above is my understanding as someone who is still learning the language."

S' It is sometimes easy, but not always easy and sometimes not possible at all.The crux of the problem is that it\'s hard to tell when you incorrectly conclude that someone is a native speaker. Short of going around and asking all the writers on Quora whether or not they\'re native English speakers, how would you confirm your judgement?I can often tell whether a particular mistake or awkward turn of phrase is likely to have come from a non-native speaker. There are indeed patterns of writing that are vanishingly rare among natives, and when I see one of those, I immediately know that the writer learned English as a second language. In some cases I can even guess what the writer\'s native language is. Most native English speakers who\'ve spent much time reading text by non-natives can probably do the same.But if there are no awkward phrases or grammar errors or strange word choices in a piece of writing, all I can conclude is that the author has near-native-level fluency in English. The absence of the kinds of errors typical of non-native speakers does not prove that English is the author\'s mother tongue.And here is where it\'s easy to fall victim to a cognitive bias and a logical error. Anyone who believes they can always pick out the writing of a non-native speaker because they\'ve seen lots of obvious examples of non-native-speaker text is falling victim to a common fallacy called denying the antecedent:If there are mistakes a native speaker wouldn\'t make, the writer learned English as a second language.There are no mistakes a native speaker wouldn\'t make.Therefore, the writer did not learn English as a second language.#3 does not follow from #1 and #2.The only viable basis of an unqualified, blanket "yes" answer -- as opposed to a "most of the time" answer -- is to believe that it is literally impossible for any non-native speaker to ever write the exact same piece of text a native speaker would have written. That idea seems clearly ridiculous to me.'

S' Flashcards are a useful supplementary tool, but they need to be secondary to other techniques such as regular conversation and writing practice and regular reading of texts in your language of choice. As long as you\'re focused mostly on those other things, flashcards (especially software flashcards with a good spaced repetition algorithm) can boost your retention to a modest degree.One reason flashcards don\'t work well as a primary learning tool is that no language is a carbon copy of your native language with the vocabulary switched to an alternate set of words. So memorizing definitions isn\'t enough; you need to know how the words are put together in actual use. For example, if you have a flashcard that helps you memorize the fact that "" is the Chinese word for "to be," that won\'t help you remember that Chinese doesn\'t always use the concept of "to be" the way English does; if you naively try to say, "He is hungry" using that word, the sentence will make no sense. If you read a lot, you\'ll come across the equivalent Chinese sentence enough times that you won\'t be tempted to write or say it the wrong way.Flashcards also don\'t help you smoothly recall words in context, which is vital for conversation. If you rely too heavily on them, your brain will train itself to take seconds to recall a single word, and you won\'t be able to talk to anyone without constantly pausing to recall words. Of course, no matter what, that\'s going to happen sometimes, but in my experience as a flashcard-using language learner, it\'ll happen a lot less if you\'re used to seeing, hearing, and using your new words in the context of a sentence or a paragraph rather than in isolation. Example sentences on the flashcards can help bridge a bit of that gap but not all of it.'

S' First, decide which Taiwanese accent you want, because there\'s more than one. Broadly speaking, southerners and northerners have noticeably different accents; the accent in the south is further removed from standard Mandarin. There are smaller regional variations but south-north is the big obvious split.Assuming you want to sound like a southerner, here are a few of the obvious differences that you can practice on your own. All my formal instruction in Mandarin used a standard mainland putonghua accent (which I did my best to pick up) but I married a woman from southern Taiwan, just so you know what perspective this is from. A lot of this isn\'t unique to Taiwan per se, but is also found in the accents of southern areas of the mainland.Neutral tone is used far, far less than in putonghua. For example, in putonghua,  (fly) is pronounced, "cngying" but the Taiwanese pronounce the tone of the second syllable and it\'s, "cngyng."There is almost no  (changing the final sound of a syllable to "r"). It happens a little bit, but in general if you practice never doing it at all, you\'ll be pretty close. Example: mainlanders pronounce / as "dir" (and the  is often included in written form) while Taiwanese say, "din."There are some consonant shifts that happen a lot of the time but not all the time:"ch" becomes "c" --  is read, "ho c" rather than, "ho ch.""sh" becomes "s" --  and  are pronounced the same."zh" becomes "z" --  is read, "znglng" rather than, "zhnglng."The "r" sound is often not enunciated.  comes out sounding like the English word, "Uh." I remember when I\'d just met my wife and she told me the price of something was $22, she said, "h s h kui" and, having only learned the putonghua pronunciation, I had no idea what she meant.I welcome corrections or clarifications from native speakers; these are just the main differences I\'ve personally observed.'

S' As a newly-arrived immigrant without a higher education and with limited skill in the language of your new home, your job prospects are pretty limited. You can choose manual labor. In a lot of cases there\'s a business sector that is dominated by people from your country and is set up to hire newly-arrived immigrants (think Cambodian donut shops or Vietnamese hairdressers in the USA). But the one skill you probably have is feeding yourself and your family, so opening a restaurant to make a living from that skill makes a lot of sense. If there\'s a big enough population of people from wherever you\'re from, you\'ll even have a good support network and a lot of business resources available to you, not to mention a pool of potential customers for your food.This is not unique to Chinese people. A couple blocks from my house there\'s a Lebanese restaurant owned by a family from Lebanon. It\'s pretty easy to find Italian restaurants opened by Italian people. Your local authentic sushi joint? Probably opened by a Japanese person. Visit London and you\'ll find all sorts of Indian restaurants with owners from India. When I was going to school in China there was a hamburger place around the corner owned by an American expat.That said, the Chinese diaspora is large enough and has been going on long enough that there are some interesting and unique things about the Chinese restaurant world. In a lot of ways it forms a distinct sector of the economy. For a great history of overseas Chinese food, I highly recommend Jennifer 8. Lee\'s book "The Fortune Cookie Chronicles." You will learn all about the pipeline of people moving from Fujian province to the United States to work in restaurants (there\'s a network of people in both the USA and China who work the immigration system to keep the supply of new arrivals flowing), about the reasons so many Chinese restaurant menus in the USA look identical to one another (there\'s a company that sells them!) and about how various Chinese dishes were adapted to foreign taste.'

S' There isn\'t one, because "fastest" and "easiest" are mutually incompatible and "best" is too subjective to have a single answer.The easiest way? One possibility: listen to language lessons during your daily commute. I recommend Pimsleur as a starting point. It requires little effort beyond talking back to a recording.The fastest way? Move to a place where that language is spoken and your native one isn\'t, and enroll yourself in language classes there. The classes will give you a foundation, and the environment will give you constant reinforcement and practice. You\'ll learn quickly but "easy" won\'t be a word you\'ll use to describe the process.'

S' One cause of the confusion behind this question is that when the tonal nature of Chinese is described to English speakers, "\'ma\' can mean horse or mother!" is always the first (and often the only) example given. The question details are absolutely correct that in most cases, context would allow one to easily distinguish those two specific examples.Here are some other examples where it may be easier to imagine the wrong tones changing the meaning of a sentence but still making sense in context. fnrn = an ordinary person fnrn = a criminal fnrn = an aborigine fwn = dispatch a message fwn = ask a question difu = doctor dif = godfather (older usage), on one\'s father\'s behalf dif = Dave xfng = a room set aside for a new baby xfng = a room on the west side of a houseDespite the wishes to the contrary of thousands of beginning students of Mandarin, tones are really not an optional part of the spoken language, and native speakers both use them and listen for them 100% of the time on a subconscious level. They\'re just part of the pronunciation, not an extra thing on top of the pronunciation.Get them wrong in a way that isn\'t typical of a well-known regional variation in native-speaker pronunciation and your listener might be able to figure out what you meant to say, but you\'ll be forcing them to do more work to understand you. And they\'ll guess wrong, or completely fail to come up with a possible interpretation, some percentage of the time.'

S' You\'re operating under the assumption that the goal of pinyin is to allow native English speakers to come close to correct pronunciation of Mandarin without special training. But that isn\'t, and never was, the goal; it was developed by Chinese scholars for use as an instructional aid by Chinese teachers teaching pronunciation to Chinese students. Whether or not untrained foreigners could read it easily was not a primary concern.Mangling pronunciations of written words isn\'t unique to Chinese and pinyin! Show an English speaker the word "croissant" and see if a monolingual French speaker can work out what "crew saunt" is supposed to mean. Or, heck, show a native Mandarin speaker the standard Chinese transliteration of my name and see how many English speakers make the connection between "shr tee foo" and "Steven."There are plenty of older romanization systems to choose from. The Yale system is probably the best suited of the major ones for the goal you\'re looking for, namely, achieving the closest approximation of correct pronunciation using English pronunciation rules with no prior training. If you\'re a Chinese person who is concerned about English-speaking foreigners butchering your name, in a lot of cases you\'re free to romanize it in whatever way you like and you can just put the Yale romanization on your business card. (Of course, French- or Spanish-speaking foreigners will proceed to read it using their own languages\' pronunciation rules and you\'ll be back to square one.)But it\'s the prerogative of China to decide on the official romanization system for its national language, and they chose pinyin. It\'s not going away any time soon regardless of what anyone thinks about it.'

S' It really depends on what your actual reading level is -- "beginner" is pretty vague, and if you\'re a complete beginner with fewer than a few hundred characters under your belt, you will have an extremely tough time making it through any Chinese novel, even children\'s books. A couple recommendations assuming you\'re past that level:The Lady in the Painting is a novelization of a folk tale. It assumes the reader knows 300 basic characters; it introduces a few more but mostly sticks to that limited vocabulary. This was the first full book I ever read in Chinese, though it\'s a pretty short one.The Chinese Breeze series consists of books at a few different skill levels, starting at about a 300-word vocabulary.Once you\'re at a point where you can read the Chinese Breeze books reasonably well, I recommend ditching the "for beginners" requirement and getting some native-speaker reading material whose subject matter is of interest to you. For example, I\'m currently on book three of Liu Cixin\'s "Three-Body" series, which is considered by a lot of people to be the best science-fiction trilogy to come out of China. It is definitely not beginner-level material; it is written for adult native speakers and I wouldn\'t have been ready to tackle it before studying Chinese for several years. But the story is right up my alley so I\'m compelled to keep reading to see what happens next, even if it constantly throws new words and phrases at me.Another piece of advice: use technology to your advantage. Whenever I buy a Chinese novel, I also immediately track down an electronic copy so I can load it into the Pleco app on my iPad and read it there. The Pleco reader feature has dictionary integration built in, so I can tap on an unfamiliar word and get a definition (and even add the word to my flashcard list if I want) without losing the flow of the story. Trying to read a paper book using a separate dictionary to look up new words is far, far less engrossing, not to mention much slower.'

S" I've found it most helpful to use software that can test each element independently. Pleco's flashcard system, for example, supports that. You could get much the same effect with physical cards if you used multiple cards per vocabulary word, e.g.,Pinyin // CharactersEnglish // Charactersand, if you like, the third combinationEnglish // PinyinThe nice thing about this setup is that it lets you account for different levels of recall of different aspects of a word. If you have no trouble remembering what a given set of characters means, but a harder time remembering how to pronounce it, you can focus on just the pronunciation part (and not waste time on the meaning) by repeating just that card more often."

S' Taipei, the city, is the capital of Taiwan, so it\'s part of Taiwan.What the question asker might be wondering about, though, is that there\'s something called "Chinese Taipei" that competes in the Olympics and other international sporting events. For all intents and purposes, it\'s the same as Taiwan.The name is used for political reasons. The official position of both the People\'s Republic of China (aka "China") and the Republic of China (aka "Taiwan") is that the island of Taiwan is a province of China that\'s currently governed by a different political entity than the mainland is. At the same time, there is a significant independence movement in Taiwan that wants the island to be recognized as its own separate country, full stop.Competing under the name "Taiwan" would, to some people, be an implicit statement that Taiwan isn\'t part of China. "Chinese Taiwan" would upset the pro-independence camp by effectively stating that Taiwan is part of China. "Chinese Taipei" skirts the question well enough to satisfy all but a small minority of people on either side, and everyone can get on with enjoying the games.Hong Kong, which is universally recognized as part of China, also competes in the Olympics under its own banner rather than as part of the Chinese national team, which has the side effect of bolstering the ambiguity of the Taiwanese team\'s status.'

S' I\'m going to assume the "early" here refers to the original pre-reboot run of the show rather than to the very earliest black-and-white episodes with the First Doctor.In terms of production values: the original is far worse, sometimes laughably so. That\'s part of the charm for the most part, though occasionally it distracts from the stories.In terms of storytelling: it varies. The first two Doctors\' stories would for the most part be considered far too slow-paced by today\'s standards; even as a fan I find it a chore to watch some of them. By the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) the pace picked up. For my money, the storytelling in the episodes for Doctors 3-5 was the best of the show both pre- and post-reboot. The show started to run out of steam by the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) with less-interesting stories.During the years of Doctors 3, 4, and 5, the show benefited a lot from its format, despite the need for cliffhangers David Stewart\'s answer mentions. Most stories were four half-hour episodes, roughly double the length of a standalone episode of the new series. That gave the writers ample opportunity to do world-building. A frequent feature of stories of that era was that a lot of screen time was devoted to the guest characters, showing their situation in detail and developing their personalities -- whereas the modern series is almost always from the point of view of the Doctor or his companion, the original series often presented the points of view of the people living in whichever place the story was set. This gave the stories more depth and allowed the writers to build more complex, detailed worlds.That difference extended beyond mere screen time. The new series\' stories tend to be driven forward by the Doctor. He is unambiguously the most important character not just of the show as a whole, but of each story\'s narrative. In some cases it\'s fair to say that absent the Doctor\'s arrival, nothing interesting would have happened in the places he visited. The original series sometimes took that approach, but more often, the Doctor arrived in the middle of events already in motion, and the guest characters were active players in the narrative.Of the new series, I\'d say the two-parter "The Impossible Planet" / "The Satan Pit" came closest to the storytelling style of the original series.Both versions of the show have their merits and both of them have lousy episodes as well as brilliant ones, but for me, if you can get past the shoddy sets and laughable special effects, the old series is, by and large, the better of the two.'

S' Dalian is my favorite city in China, though more because it has a laid-back vibe and a relatively clean environment than because it\'s chock full of attractions. Nonetheless, here are some things I\'ve enjoyed in my time there:Tiger Beach () has a small aquarium with penguins and other animals, an amusement park, and an old Chinese Navy ship you can board and walk around.Russian Street east of the train station is a remnant of the city\'s past, when it was called Dairen and was part of Russia. You can see the old Russian-style buildings and browse shops full of Russian goods, from food to random knickknacks.The Shell Museum near Xinghai Park has an impressive collection of seashells with information (in Chinese) on the animals that used to wear them. The shells are worth seeing even if you can\'t read the labels.Dining on the fresh local seafood. Ask a local what the good restaurants are since they change and any recommendation I could give would be out of date already.Bingyu Valley Scenic Area () bills itself as "little Guilin" which is an overstatement, but it\'s quite a pleasant area with gorges and a small river to walk along. A bit of a drive from Dalian but easily doable as a day trip.Labor Park () is large and varied, with wooded paths you can walk in isolation, a miniature zoo, a couple of the city\'s most famous landmarks (the "soccer ball" and the giant Ferris wheel), amusement park rides, and a ski lift leading up to the TV tower on the hill above, which is also open to the public and has a good exhibit (in Chinese) on Dalian\'s history.The electronics shopping mall underneath Olympic Square is fun to walk around, though it\'s nothing you wouldn\'t find in half a dozen other cities.At night (though possibly not every night) the plaza behind the train station turns into a giant dance floor with various partner dances including hustle, tango, and west coast swing.People\'s Square () has a water show in the evening with dancing fountains and music. It seems to be a popular family outing.If you\'re there at the right time of year, go out to one of the local cherry farms. Several of them let you pick your own fresh cherries. Dalian\'s cherries are quite good.Eat! There are good restaurants scattered around the city, but if you want an easy quick fix in the older part of the city, the shopping area underneath Victory Square has a food court with a large variety of different foods. A slightly more upscale, but still inexpensive, alternative would be the floor underneath the Wal-Mart near Olympic Square. And of course there is plenty of street food to choose from; a couple of the side streets off of Huanghe Road near Liaoning Normal University have an especially large number of vendors at night, as does the area just north of Labor Park near the New Mart shopping mall.As is probably obvious from my answer, I\'m more partial to the original part of the city on the southern side of Dalian Bay than to the Jinzhou area; it has more character in my opinion.'

Cry, cry your guts out. Move on. My personal suggestion. You may take it or leave it, I don\'t know her nor you. It\'s extremely tough to say anything. It\'s your life, your decision.I follow this , "Never be where you\'re not wanted, never.Never be with who doesn\'t value or want you.Kick the person out of your life who treats you like now-needed-tomorrow not needed. "It\'s better being depressed for while than be treated less than what you deserve.You may tell her you wI\'ll move on. Cut the one month. 1. Cut all ties. No stalking. No talking. She wanted to move on. She can manage. You need to manage yourself. If she cries, tell her she needs to be on either side of the bank not in the river. If she can\'t decide, well then she needs to suffer alone and not make you suffer with her.2. Move on by focusing on yourself. Be busy like never before. Make a time table and be disciplined! This works like magic.3. Be with your family and friends. Tell your friends not to mention her in front of you, not because you hate her but because you\'re trying to move on. (I did that for a friend. Even when she was talking about the guy. I diverted. She loved it as she knew she needed it.)4. Exercise! Even if you don\'t feel like. Get that hot body out. Heard of "happy hormones"?5. Watch movies but not romantic ones. Do whatever you like but nothing which remindes you of her.6. Don\'t go into vices like drinking, one night stands. Be stronger and do the right thing.(Not that it\'s wrong but here the cause is wrong).7. Don\'t hate her. She was honest to you. Appreciate that. Don\'t need to love her either. While moving on just drag your mind out whenever it goes thinking about her by doing something else.8. Meet new people.even if it\'s shopping counter one or two sentences. Hopefully will help a lot. 9. See the people less fortunate than you. Do something for them. Happiness is contagious! It\'ll attack you too ;)You have people who love you. Love and live for them. Don\'t cry over someone who didn\'t want you. The biggest myth is "cannot live without him/her" .  It may be tough for a while but it\'s your choice to crumble to pieces or come out as a survivor.Be a survivor. You will find someone who values and loves you. Maybe she might come back. But cross that bridge when you get there. Being with someone who is fickle minded about wanting you or not is NOT something I can bear. I do appreciate her a LOT for telling you honestly!It\'s time to love yourself more. You need yourself to love you. You deserve it. Smile. Be a survivor. Believe me... you\'ll laugh tomorrow!

Choose anyone.To help people.To fulfill their dreams and in those moments share their joy!To make all of them proud.To eat every type of chocolate in the world!To get fitter.To travel.To learn a few things.To marry and have kids.To tell my loved ones that i love them.Meet Robert Downey Jr. , Arjun Kapoor / Ranvir Singh / Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachan. :D'

S" Okay! Lemme see... would I mind it? Emm emm emm...NO! I'd love it! :D 1. He cares how I look. Unless guys are fashion designers it's usually tough for them...I would highly appreciate it.2. If a dress is too revealing and he asks me to cover it. I'll feel he wants that only he gets to see the detailed stuff. Which I feel is absolutely adorable and loving. He doesn't want to risk a dirty eye on me. I'll just fall hopelessly more in love with him.3. If he asks me to dress in a certain way with his parents. I'll feel honoured and be in love more! Because he is saying so so that his parents like me, the relationship between his parents and me stays good. His parents would be equally important to me. I'd love to respect their wishes and family culture.It will mean he feels me as his better half and sees his future with me: Bliss! Feeling stronger and more loved.Nobody in today's world would ask to wear only saree and hide face with the cloth till the neck. So if and when my man would suggest me some dresses I would love it.Edit:If I happen to visit villages then yes, I would follow family tradition. Because even now (I'm unmarried ) I still do follow family traditions and while in a village I dont wear jeans and tees.*sigh* the question mentions boyfriend! Nobody chooses a person like: Before: Mini skirt.After: Wear sarees only.The former go with former girls, latter with latter.On a point raised: Wouldn't I choose and vice versa someone who knows that I'm inbetween completely open person and conservative. Broad minded yes.I'm not a 24*7 saree person but I'm not a mini skirt person either.Why would I choose a Hitler who selects dresses like Koreans choose haircuts if I'm not a Nazi."

S' In the simplest and rawest example I can give.1. Hitler was great. I don\'t think he was happy (he committed suicide). One of the Greatest men in history.2. A baby is happy. He is in no way great! His eyes, smile, laugh, cheeks, body language is all happiness... just pure happiness.3. Most important story! Alexander the great! And yet when he died he spread the msg:1. I own wealth of the world... I carry none to my grave.2. No doctor could save my life.Having said that (ponder over that) why can\'t you have both. Share your greatness, share what you have and I think you\'ll be happy. Be happy in what you do, whatever you do... and see greatness will come to you.Funny part? Greatness might lead to greed.Happiness leads to sharing and leads to more happiness.I was commuting the other day, the traffic was moving slow. There was a little girl learning to sew clothes. I leaned over from my vehicle and by action expressed out "wow. Very beautiful!" YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE SMILE SHE HAD!It made my day! I made someone smile! That\'s my super power... and thanks to God, that makes me great! And wow! Happy too!Incident 2: I am blessed to be financially decent. Im not rich. But relative to a beggar I have more. Here my greatness lies in money in my purse.While walking I saw a beggar, stopped, bought him a meal and water, washed his hands, opened the food packet and served him.Toothless smile on a dirt face. Believe me... it was PRICELESS! I felt happy!Bottom line: I\'d choose happiness any day! I\'d rather be happy till I die than be great! Unless the greatness can be shared and make me happy.'

S" Thanks for A2A Angara Sreeniketh.A very interesting question.On critical thinking... what I feel is that,1. We were ruled by British. We first awed them. Then were made to awe them.Kings and people wanted to ape them in dress, food everything. Some were forced. Bottom line we awed them.2. Then we had to strive hard to survive. We saw that fame is an end product of power. See, how that effects the psychology?We like fame. Fame ~= recognition.3. The west was flourishing. West had glamour, richness, and power. It was being recognised! That were the beginning after the world of super rule by British and others and more importantly the world war 2.We got used to aping.We saw them being recognised. We wanted that.Eg: A flourishes and gets recognised.B awes A. Next response of B? I TOO WANT IT! LET ME RECOGNISE MYSELF AND WANT C TO RECOGNISE ME TOO.4. As a developing country we are constantly striving extra hard to improve. Which requires analysis, which leads to estimation and then recognising the result.Leading to self recognising and it's importance.5. Who doesn't love responses. I do.And it means a LOT for me to being responded.Response is similar to being recognised. Recognised as a person or for something you did.I love being showered with appreciation, response to me (my work personal / professional. No response, I dislike and gradually lose interest in doing it for the Co. Or people). I love knowing that what i did meant something to someone or someones isn't that why we do it? If the people or Co. Doesn't respond I feel like they didn't bother even looking at it or it didn't matter to them. Don't we remember things which matter to us.

S" 1. Take some wheat flour. Make a thick paste. If you find turmeric add a pinch. Apply on the area let it dry a bit then rub it. Keep rubbing it till you get those rolls. (Not a very good sight).This is a long term process. So might take months to couple of years maybe.The wheat germ helps in reducing the hair growth.2. As many suggested to get waxed. Get waxing done during your periods. Hormonal changes take place during then. So gradually the hair growth gets drastically reduced. This works faster than wheat.I was hairy as a teen on my arms and legs. I try to get waxing done during my periods the pain is also felt less and my body hair have considerably reduced. So it should work on chest hair too.3. I've heard that (NOT TRIED) apply some lemon juice on the area and sit in the sun for a while. This is natural bleaching.These are my suggestions.

S' Words of wisdom from the wisest persons I know- My grandma and grandpa (maternal and paternal), mom, dad and the little of from my 14 years old brother:1. Go with the flow! Adjust according to circumstances!2. Keep learning. There is no age limit.3. Discipline is the highly underrated.4. Be HONEST no matter what, atleast to your loved ones. They expect it from you. You owe it to them.5. Keep smiling! Make others smile. And NEVER EVER HURT SOMEONE.6. Be understanding, loving and respectful towards a man. And even MORE towards women (my maternal grandpa said this). Never ever hurt a lady! Never ever!7. In married life:  Trust your partner wholeheartedly. But choose carefully before selecting if he is worth you.We are Indians, once committed... its a journey for life. 8. School and work life: Dedication and discipline is essential. Failure is sure and essential too. Keep learning if you want to survive and excel. When you succeed be humble and share! Share whatever you\'ve got.9. Spiritual life:  Surrender to God. He WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU. He will give you what is best for you. Ask him what you want he will hear you.10. Words from my little brother:  Why take tension didi? Don\'t be sad. We should always be happy. When he wants me to hug him, love him he comes and asks for it. So simple! Don\'t we just forget \'asking\' as we grow up?He enjoys what he does! (Except studying of course :P)He once asked me, "Why do you get angry?!" I didn\'t have an answer... have been controlling my anger ever since.He is happy with little things in life! He doesnt take stress! The principle may blow her temper... he\'ll get upset for a while and back to being calm. His logic is simple: Can I help it? No- then don\'t worry.Can I help it? Yes. Do I want to help it? (Work on it) No- then don\'t worry.Do I want to help it? Yes- fine I\'ll do it. Why worry.He makes me feel like being a child again.He makes me realise the value of having someone to trust. He trusts me so much with all his crushes, hormone changing age, knows that if he gets into trouble I\'m there. These about it for now. Will add if I remember more.'

But you both are there together, love each other and that matters.Coming to your solution: It's very very simple! Don't worry. 1.Just let go. Accept what happened and start afresh. 2. You love him.

S" You wrongfully assume people aren't dating as often. I work in an open kitchen and believe me, we get to see a lot of people on dates. Valentines day is always fully booked.There's a few key differences between dating now and what UK dating was like in the 90's.(I was a teenager in the 90's)  Communication had to be more organised. Phone calls had to be made via a landline or a phone box. None of this SMS business where you could leave a message to be read later. There would be times when youd literally have to sit next to your phone and wait. And wait. And wait until you need the toilet because thats the only time it would ring.  It took effort to find someone. Meeting potential life partners usually meant going to a local bar or club (meat markets) or through a friend of a friend. A meat market person didnt usually end up being too deep and meaningful. Dating a friend of a friend was based around a convoluted routine:1) Let your friends know you fancy her/him. They would tell them and find out if they fancy you.2) Start meeting the object of your affections at social, crowded gatherings and make prolonged eye contact followed by maybe even talking (probably about the weather).3) Acquire their phone number and hang out by the landline in anticipation of a prolonged chat (usually including the weather).4) Start by holding hands, after a week get off/snog one another in full view of everyone. This was a way of earning kudos. 5) Achieve going out together status. Once GOT status was ascertained , everyone will presume you were having sex at every conceivable opportunity. More kudos.6) Hang out in each others bedrooms, where you'd bitch about your parents, do compatibility quizzes and make friendship bracelets.6) Break up because it turns out she was into Oasis and youre into Blur. 7) Start again.  You didnt know what you were letting yourself in for. Its normal these days to indulge in a little online research to help ensure youre not going on a date with an axe murderer. Things werent so easy in the 90s, especially if you met someone in a pub or club. Youd have to rely on rumours, which is never a good thing.  You had limited sex education. Nowadays you can find instructional videos in seconds. Back then, sex education was either via an embarrassed teacher putting a condom on a banana, daytime educational shows on TV (oh the sheer joy of turning on Channel 4 after pulling a sickie and looking at drawings of female anatomy), rumours from your friends (never a good thing) or finding a porn mag in a hedge.   You had to make conversation. When it finally happened and you actually managed to go on a date, you had to make conversation using your actual mouth and words and inflection. This was a deal breaker. You couldnt just show your favourite cat pics, or YouTube videos or memes. You had to at least seem interested and engage in banter.  You had to make an effort. Back in the 90s, if you really fancied someone, youd make them a mixtape and/or write a love letter. A mixtape would contain some choice songs, usually recorded from the radio, which conveyed you were deep into music and knew just the right song to play at just the right moment of any situation. They conveyed your personality and how ambitious you were with your creativity. A love letter would show how in touch you were with your feelings. It would demonstrate your use of vocabulary. It was slow, but this was good. A love letter builds anticipation. Not only that, you could do one thing that an email or any kind of online message cant do: You could impregnate it with a scent - usually CK One. This makes it so much more personal.  There were no digital footprints. You could physically tell your friends what happened the night before, but you didnt have to let them know. You could get up to absolutely anything and not be concerned about whether youd left your geolocation on by accident. You could effectively be unreachable from the second you left the house. This gave you an air of mystery, which is instantly desirable.   There were no digital footprints (part 2). There was no scrolling through someones Twitter feed, no looking at past girl/boyfriends on Facebook, no WhatsApp last seens. You could meet someone randomly, have some fun and if, for whatever reason, you forgot their surname, that could be it. Forever. Love could be a lot more fleeting. There was none of this looking-someone-up-after-a-few-years-of-singledom-to-see-they-are-now-successful-with-a-beautiful-girlfriend-and-a-child-on-the-way stuff. Which always makes everything a 100 times worse.So in conclusion (tl;dr): dating was simpler, yet hard work. Everything was more private, yet fleeting. You had to be more organised and creative."

S" There is the ongoing stereotype surrounding English dental hygiene.Thanks to programs such as The Simpsons:And Mike Myers didnt particularly help:These views are seriously out-of-date and dont marry with an image conscious society. According to the private market research group Mintel, the spending on cosmetic dentistry now ranges in the billions of pounds. This is largely due to the how the media portrays beauty and not indicative of a nation's health.We also have a National Health Service, which includes orthodontics. This is where we can get free braces and dental care if we're younger than 18. Once we're an adult we can visit an NHS dentist and get the costs heavily subsidised. As it turns out, Americans statistically have worse teeth than the English and this could largely be put down diet and how frequently they visit the dentist. So yes, were laughing. Were laughing with our big, toothy mouths.Sourced from: The myth of bad British teeth - BBC News"

S" *Contains spoilers*Brazil (1985) has some of the best dream sequences. They provide a welcome juxtaposition to the harrowing, dystopian, bureaucratic, retro-futuristic world created by Terry Gilliam.The film follows Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), a low level clerk for the Ministry Of Information. He lives within a society under complete control of a somewhat incompetent government.The only way Sam can escape the dystopic nightmarish society is via his unconscious and its exactly that which helps the viewer to understand the film.The opening sequence is perhaps everyone's dream: To fly. To fly like a bird, to swoop and soar over a lush English countryside towards a beautiful woman enveloped in white veils. As the film progresses, his dreams begin to match real life as they become responsible for the ensuing chaos.The countryside makes way for the towering city walls, creepy creatures wearing baby masks and a giant robotic samurai trying to steal his seraphim. Thanks to YouTube there is a compilation of the dream sequences to add gravitas to my meagre description. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...There is so much symbolism going on in his dreams, it's easy to see how it crosses over into Sam's reality.Sam's dreams start as a parallel to Icarus, where the sun is actually Jill. He flies too close to her which subsequently leads to his downfall.The creatures with baby-like masks represent his enemies. They are the ones leading Jill through the city. Later on, you see his dear friend Jack wearing a baby mask just before torture commences.The Samurai represents technology. It's when the mask is removed and Sam see's his own face underneath, that he realises he is complicit with society and is as bad as everyone else. Even the word Samurai is a clue: Sam-you-are-i.There are many more things you won't necessarily notice until you've seen the film more than once (the end Tuttle sequence and the working lifts for example). This film works on many levels and takes a few viewings to notice all the nuances. For me, this is the makings of a masterpiece."

Other alternatives are the back door or defenestration.Leave.Take a second to wonder at the outside world. Let the air hit your lungs. Give it a few seconds for your eyes to adjust to the daylight. Take a step.Congratulations! You've made it to the outside world. Take a moment to steady yourself as the realisation dawns - this is where the sexy people reside. Now all you have to do is make the connection from the intelligent bit in your head to your skeleton. Using your muscles and bones you're going to have to walk.

S' Okay, so I\'ve been through this rather substantial thread and I\'m quite bored of seeing the Silence Of The Lambs poster and how it relates to Salvador Dal. I like to think I have an eye for aesthetics and that\'s the point of a film poster - to catch the eye. Here are four film posters that caught my attention which aren\'t fan-art reworkings.The Truman Show (1998)This is one of my favourites - Jim Carrey. From a distance the poster depicts just a happy go lucky guy wearing a suit staring off into the distance with a sense of happiness and contentment. It\'s not until you look a little closer that you see the photo is made up of screenshots from Trumans life. This is called a photo mosaic and it was the first time I\'d see that effect.The Memory Thief (2007)"Lukas (Mark Webber) is a lost soul who will create a world that will push him over the edge in "The Memory Thief." A Christian, he immerses himself in the Holocaust and adopts the persona of a survivor of the camps. But instead of finding his own humanity, Lukas, a toll taker who on the surface has a good heart - he gives his neighbors rent money, he cares for his comatose mother, he rescues a dog - becomes obsessed with, and makes a perversion of, the survivor\'s memories."The poster itself is rather striking, as expected for any image that\'s 99% black & white. This compliments the overall bleak feeling of the film.BUG (2006)"A haunted woman with an ex-husband in the clink and a traumatic past eating away at her encounters a disaffected young man who ushers her into an underworld of conspiracies about conspiracies, army experiments, aphids, microchips, the status quo, remote control assassins, and love."Another monotone poster showing Ashley Judd (Agnes) framed by what seems like several insects spliced together backlit against a grainy background. You know this isn\'t going to be a romantic comedy.Brazil (1985)"Low-level bureaucrat Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) escapes the monotony of his day-to-day life through a recurring daydream of himself as a virtuous hero saving a beautiful damsel. Investigating a case that led to the wrongful arrest and eventual death of an innocent man instead of wanted terrorist Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro), he meets the woman from his daydream (Kim Greist), and in trying to help her gets caught in a web of mistaken identities, mindless bureaucracy and lies."This is one poster I\'d love to have on my wall. It depicts Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) about to drift off into a fantasy/dream sequence - the juxtaposition of the nightmarish, dystopian world in which he lives.'

S' The general consensus of this thread is yes, some restaurants (eateries, if you will) allow people to eat leftovers, so Ill add my two cents.I worked somewhere in which a front of house was continually eating the leftovers. Fine, right? No, because he was eating leftovers straight off the customers plate as soon as he entered the kitchen. Ew. These were the thoughts running through my head (as well as trying to keep control of the kitchen and the team):1) Thats disgusting.2) Who knows where that customer has been. Have they washed their hands? Have they dribbled on the plate? Has they spat out that food? 3) Now youve put your hand to your mouth and youre going to take out another order? This is how infections start.4) Why do you feel you the need to eat when we wont be eating for another couple of hours, if at all.After the third time I had to stop what I was doing and have a word. He didnt seem to think there were any problems with it, which actually surprised me. I informed the restaurant manager and we both agreed something had to be done. To my surprise, there wasnt any specific policy about it (unless you call it theft), so we made one up: no eating from customers plates. Three strikes and youre out. We held a meeting, in which he attended to make sure everyone was aware of the new rule. Simple. And Guess what, within two weeks he hadnt learnt his lesson and was fired. To fall in line with the premise of the question, my place of work is quite relaxed about leftovers/wastage/mistakes. I work in an Italian restaurant where the focus is pizza. This allows for huge overheads: A piece of dough costs 5p, passata and mozzarella costs 10p, we sell a margarita for 8.99. We deal with a lot of fresh food, so theres a justified amount of wastage, were allowed to take home what we want. Mistakes can be eaten away from the public eye.The thing is We all get free food. You may think this is a good thing and to a degree it is, but its a double edged sword. The problem is, we have to eat the same food day in day out. This makes it incredibly boring. I used to enjoy Italian food, but Im now sick of it. The only thing it provides is relief from the nagging pain in the pit of my stomach. So, in actual fact, I, and no one else wants to take home the leftovers. Its reverse psychology!'

S' Alexa Meade is an artist who uses Humans as her canvas. She turns them into living, breathing portraits. The effect is quite astonishing. The 28 year old made an impact on the art world when her works were featured on http://kottke.org/ (apparently one of the top influential blogs in the world). She quickly went viral because she has managed to create these reality distorting images despite having no formal training. She\'s recieved converage on CNN and various US national TV shows which came as a bit of of a shock. Speaking in 2008, she says "I started covering things in paint, from trees to blades of grass. I wanted to reference what was directly beneath the paint, and capture the shadows dripping on the landscape." From there she moved on to painting Human subjects, as you can see, this is where she had the most impact: Alexa is currently working on a couple of tech collaborations playing with augmented reality as well as virtual reality. She\'s creating some tessellating shape tiles as a design toy that helps build spatial intelligence.To view more of her photos, please have a look at her website: http://www.alexameade.com/'

S' Compared to being the father to a baby, a toddler is childs play (geddit?). At 3 years old, my son Elijah is just about 6 months further along the potholed, often sodden road to adulthood from toddlerhood, and its joyous. Hes a miniature sponge, figuratively and, well, he does try to absorb his dinner through osmosis. He even laughs at my frequent lame jokes, which I use as a form of torture. This is a good time to be a dad to a child.Times werent always so rosy, inevitably you hit some potholes. The word no becomes more frequent, tantrums are intense. All attention has to be on him, whether its at home or in public. The toilet is always a gajillion miles away. A good nights sleep is worth a gold star and here we hit the crux of the question like a pair of poo filled pants to the face:Sleep.Or lack thereof. I know its part of parenthood, I know it cant be helped, but the early mornings are something I seriously struggle with. I work as a chef, sometimes not finishing until 10:30pm, its natural for me to awake late into the evening. When my darling little munchkin decides the only way to rouse me is to either A) tickle my feet or B) jump on my tummy shouting daddy daddy its time to wake up!, my patience is a little Tested. Especially at 6am. The saving grace is he would have a nap in the afternoon, this means I could too (I mean, Im only 32, I thought afternoon naps were for old people Sadly no). The problem was compounded when I had the early start plus a day of working in a hot, pressured kitchen surrounded by knives. Many of them sharp. Caffeine was (and still is) my friend. Things are a little easier now because he doesnt mind reading or playing, even if its just for a little while. That half an hour of extra solace is a blessing. It amuses me when I know he will turn into that odious beast known as a teenager who will sleep long into the afternoon. Then it will be my turn to wake him up. Maybe Ill tickle his feet (no chance) or bounce on his stomach (asking for trouble), or perhaps as my mum did to me: vacuum - sorry, there was a speck of dust I really needed to dispose of. Retribution will be mine muhaha.'

S' Its certainly a double edged sword. I currently work in an open kitchen and have done for over 3 years, for me, I consider it middle house - Not quite front of house, not quite back of house - somewhere in-between. Prior to my present job, I worked for nine years behind closed doors. This allowed me to be a lot more brazen, generally louder and relaxed with my language (swearing can be a British pastime). To begin with, the transition to middle house was somewhat bumpy to say the least. Here are the differences compiled into a handy list:Volume levels have to be kept in check. Sometimes the obligatory sneeze screens dont muffle your voice as much as you think. Our TripAdvisor scores are generally good, but I did make it clear that if a customer is allergic to pepper, they have a right to tell the waitress so the kitchen can take the necessary allergy containment steps. Unfortunately, the customer heard my complaint and wrote a complaint themselves.Figuratively, you work in a goldfish bowl. People stare. People stare a lot. Its often awkward, downright wearisome and perpetually perturbing. I understand people are hungry or just interested in what youre doing, but anyone would feel distracted when they look up to see ten+ pairs of eyes trained on their every move. The kitchen is set towards the back of the room, so its my prerogative to check incoming and outgoing customers for effective time/team management. Its really easy for people to think youre looking at them, when in fact you just want to Get. Stuff. Done.The music is humdrum. Music has always been a staple of a kitchen environment (except for when its busy). Working in an open kitchen subjects you to the restaurant music. Theres no freedom of choice. Its repetitive, distracting and mind-numbing. The only chance of a respite is on an open when I insist on earphones for some personal music time. Everyone knows when you make a mistake. You burn something, it happens. Unfortunately, in an open kitchen the room fills with smoke, theres no escaping it, the extractor fan can only do so much. Customers dont like this very much, especially when theyre hungry. It automatically makes you look like an amateur. Drop something? Prepare for a room full of people turn round to stare at you, the noise of crockery smashing feels like it lasts for minutes.You have to look happy. Hangovers happen, illness happens, sleep deprivation, fatigue, work politics, hangryness (that grumpy irritable feeling when youre hungry) through it all you have to look happy, youre a representative of the restaurant. You have to interact with customers. I believe in this world you have the kind of people who choose to be back of house and those who prefer it out front. Introvert vs extrovert if you will. FOH have to deal with the general public all day and, well, some customers are just plain weird. FOH are representatives of the restaurant - always happy to help, making the customer feel welcome and relaxed and are there to provide a pleasing atmosphere (there is a whole lot of two facedness with customers). All of this takes confidence, especially with strangers. Back of house are the pistons in the hospitality engine. They work hard under pressure, in a hot, often greasy environment, to provide the eating experience a customer should expect. Working in an open kitchen means the customer will come and talk to you regardless of how many meals are in the oven, how many tickets have just come through, how hungover you are. All you can do is try and be friendly and not burn anything. I live in constant fear of saying something I regret in the heat of the moment.Children. You cant escape them. For the most part theyre okay, but the babies will cry, cutlery will be thrown around, voices are always raised. Some children really are the spawn of the Devil though. This isnt always down to bad parenting. Ive had children run into the kitchen in the middle of busy Saturday service, draw with snot on the squeeze screens (I have to clean those you know!), vomit, incessantly cry until a parent has to take them outside. Having a crying child in a hot, smoky, busy environment is just want everyone needs.Its not all bad though, there are some good reasons to work in an open kitchen:Its your show. Yes, people stare, but not always because theyre hungry. Sometimes they are just interested in what you do for a living. You get used to groups of people crowding round to watch their food being made. Multitasking looks impressive when its busy.You hear indirect feedback. I love the wow factor - When a customer receives the food youve just spent 20 minutes to prepare and you hear wow or wow thats amazing. Better yet, they take a photo. That photo goes on to social media and turns into free advertising for your restaurant.You know when youre about to get busy. This is a blessing. You can see new customers; you can measure how busy youre going to get and for how long. This gives you time to prep, get breaks out of the way, train new staff, go the toilet - it takes the guesswork out of the all important time management.Mystery shoppers. These are people whose job it is to judge you, your food, the environment. Its generally different people each time, but you get to spot the signs. They order new or promotional items, they always ask to keep the receipt, they are constantly looking around, writing in a notepad and, crucially, they have to take a photo of themselves outside the restaurant. In an open kitchen you get to spot these signs and ensure their food is up to standard (as it should be). Its not just mystery shoppers, it could be the local food critic or your mother/friends/family. These are who I call V.I.Ps.*Sympathy. Ive found some customers will be sympathetic towards you if they can see youre busy, especially if youre by yourself. Ive even received sympathy tips from customers with an accompanying go buy yourself a beer after work, youve learnt it.Communications with front of house are a whole lot easier. You can see them, they can see you. Sometimes you dont even have to say anything to communicate. A nod or a wink or simply calling out which table is ready for their mains is all it takes. It saves time so the customer gets their food quicker. On occasions I can see the waiters are busy and I take out the food myself, or clear tables, or inform a waiter that a table needs their attention. So, like I said its certainly a double edged sword, but its something I definitely enjoy. Its now 10am on Saturday, time to go and get prepared for lunch.'

S' All music is subjective. I am listening to The Private Psychedelic Reel as I write this, it\'s certainly a good song, but why?As the name suggests, it pays homage to some of the psychedelic music produced in the 60\'s/70\'s and early 90\'s. The Chemical Brothers have always done well when collaborating with other artists and this song is no exception. Mercury Revs Jonathan Donahue was put to good use in adding an elaborate texture of guitar based, psychedelic, head-mashing madness to the latter half of the track. The repetitive sitar based loop adds structure to the encompassing lunacy, whilst the rhythm was reportedly provided by Jon Brookes (sadly deceased) from the band The Charlatans which and adds a juxtaposition to the straight up techno of prior tracks (RE: It Doesn\'t Matter). This gives the track a "band" atmosphere and aids the songs mission. Dig Your Own Hole offers a serotonin-tweaking rush common to all great rock \'n\' roll, but wraps it in technological inventiveness that separates it from its big beat counterparts. The Private Psychedelic Reel is the perfect way to end a modern era psychedelic trip. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Of course, this isn\'t to everyone\'s taste. It\'s very full on. The noise can be quite abhorrent out of context. Skip to 8:45 and it\'s screaming at you. That\'s the other problem, at nearly ten minutes, it\'s not the kind of song you can easily listen to every day - It\'s a victim of it\'s own epicness. Few radio stations would play it and you couldn\'t mix with it in a club. It\'s a standout, standalone song that has its place in music history, just not in the mainstream.PS. It\'s certainly not trance.'

This seems comepletely out of line with the My Little Pony ethos. Just take a look at this page: Twilights lack of knowlege has killed friendship! The sheer amount of peril in this one page would be quite daunting to those of a nervous disposition. The fear and terror in their eyes wouldn't be out of place in a Judge Dredd comic. The puns are weak, the peril is far too strong, the defeatest, pessimistic attitude of the some of the ponies is, at certain points, just too much to bear.

S' The original road signs were designed by Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert. Kinneir originally (and successfully) designed the easy to read white typography on a blue background motorway signs in 1958:The Worboys report, formally known as Traffic signs for all-purpose roads, was a report commissioned in 1962 that outlined changes to the British traffic signing system. Its fundamental aim was to review signs that were considered to be outdated and difficult to use in an era of faster motoring and higher quality roads. The Worboys comittee hired John Kinneir and his student Margaret Calvert to use the rules of the motorway signage system and apply them across the whole road network.As for the new speed camera design, information is a bit vague. Here are two art boards from The Department Of Transport: Both images are attributed to a "R.M" and one was drawn by "S.P." Due to a decrease in quality with road signage, I\'m inclined to believe they are civil servants."The design of a sign must be got down to the simplest possible level," says Michael Wolff, chairmen of The Sign Design Society."The fundamental words in sign design are clarity, consistency and simplicity."Not only do modern drivers travel faster than before, they are also listening to the radio, chatting on their hands-free phone and trying to subdue rowdy children in the back. Distractions are everywhere.A 19th Century-style bellows camera is used, with great success, to warn of the imminent danger of racking up a speeding fine and rail enthusiasts\' hearts must race at the symbol of a steam train before level crossings."Symbols don\'t have to be accurate, they are there to convey an idea and be understood,"Signs of the timesWhat makes a good road sign?'

S" There are many places in the world with huge contrasts between city life and rural life. I cant speak for everywhere, but I can offer some UK based wisdom. Ive grown up in the rural area called North Devon for 29 years. The population is of a relatively low density; theres only a few towns. Devon is also home to the largest open space in southern England: Dartmoor.In comparison to Devon (population 748,000 for the whole county), Ive lived in Melbourne, Australia (population 4.5 million) for a year, visited and stayed in a few cities throughout Europe and the UK and my Significant Other is a city girl. These are my credentials for this answer.Until the invention of the internet, it felt like, to a degree, that we were cut off from society. I mean, theres roads (the UK isnt a third world country), but many people choose to live here for The Simple Life. There are several key benefits to The Simple Life: Less stress. Theres a different pace of life here, its far more relaxed than the cities. Its for this reason many people dont like the hustle and bustle of built up urban areas - everyone seems to be in a rush.Money isnt as much of a priority. When you have a relatively low wage, but youre still subject to the same taxes and living costs, you learn to enjoy what you have (with a treat every once and a while). You start to appreciate good memories over material things (which usually end up breaking after a while). This is why I enjoy photography, its a visual representation of a memory. You have an affinity with nature. Within a 20 minute walk Im in the countryside. The rumble of modern society is barely noticeable. Fresh air fills my lungs. Im surrounded by flora and fauna. I dont have to see *anyone.* Within a 30 minute drive Im in the wilderness of Exmoor (Dartmoors younger brother) - 268 square miles of moorland, woodland, rivers and inaccessible shoreline. This is the kind of place you can live off the land like we did back in the day. Here is an example of someone (with an excellent name) who did just that: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/.... Hope is certainly living The Simple Life as she was on the verge of being part of the rural homeless community. In some ways being homeless in the countryside is easier than the cities. You can find fresh, clean water. Living off the land is achievable (whether its stealing from farmland or growing your own veg, fishing, setting traps for rabbits, mice, birds etc). Theres privacy, no one cares about what you look like and what you do because there is no one there to care about what you look like and what you do. You can become at one with nature.There are fewer serious crimes. Murder is a rarity, when it happens, its big news, it sends the community into a state of shock. There is an undercurrent of drug use because, well, theres little else to do. Burglary is fairly high because its easy to become complacent about privacy. Violence will happen usually as a consequence of alcohol, again because theres little else to do. Drink driving is a problem. The crucial difference to city life here is Ive never felt threatened walking around at night. Ive never been mugged or even approached by anyone asking more than just the time or a lighter. Theres no terrorist threat.Its quiet (obviously). Even living directly in the middle of my small town, above a road (and a Subway) theres virtually no noise except for the bloody seagulls. Saturday nights get quiet after midnight and even then Im only a 10 minute walk from quietness.Personal education. Class sizes are smaller, which provides more of a one on one education experience. Overall, research shows that students in smaller classes perform better in all subjects and on all assessments when compared to their peers in larger classes. In smaller classes, students tend to be as much as one to two months ahead in content knowledge, and they score higher on standardised assessments.So The Simple Life has its upsides, but lets compare it to urban life:Culture happens. Clubs are open to the early hours so I can listen to my favourite genres of music whenever I choose. The comedy circuit isnt a once a year event, its a year round constant - I love comedy and finding new comedians to tickle my funny bone. I can visit museums and galleries and view the works Ive only seen in books or the internet. Theres street art and performances, talks, festivals and theatre.Everything is convenient. I can go out and know I wont need to cut the night short to get home on the last bus/train. If I need medical attention, there will be help nearby. If I need food theres cafes, restaurants, food markets and supermarkets with everything Ill ever need.Increased opportunity. Life in the city gives you more opportunities in life, this is fact. There are far more jobs, places to live, educational options, and business advantages. All of this gives you a better start in life. There is simply more choice with everything.Cultural diversity. Like it or loath it, the UK is a diverse place. There is a range of different societies of different origins, religions and traditions all living and interacting together. Multiculturalism creates a rich social tapestry in UK culture, from the food on the high street, to music we listen to, to the religion and language.Theres simply more people. No longer do you run out of profiles on Tinder. An outdoor party or festival has an atmosphere. Its easier to meet a life long partner or friend.These are all key advantages to growing up in the urban sprawl and as Im growing older, I feel like Im missing out. There are some obvious disadvantages to living rurally and in a city.Rural LivingIt can be inconvenient. Theres a huge swathe of acreage with little to no internet access, let alone phone reception. To get anywhere or do anything you need transport. Bus fares mount up, petrol/diesel/car maintenance is expensive. Taxis are ridiculous. Getting stranded is a real problem. With heavy rain or snow youre likely to get cut off for days at a time. With preparation, this doesnt have to be too much of a problem. Without preparation it could be potentially life threatening.Amenities close early. Its a Sunday evening and youve run out of coriander, better go to the sho Oh no wait a minute, it closes at 4pm. The nearest supermarket is an hours drive each way, by that time dinner will be ruined - so thats no coriander then. Someones stolen your garden gnome, better go to the poli.. Oh no, its closed. Okay, so you want to get the bus into town. Its at 11:43am, you get there in plenty of ti.. Oh no, its a Saturday, the bus is at 9:27am. There. Are. No. More. Buses. Missed the last bus home? Tough.The smell of the country. Its just one of those things, farmers need to fertilise their soil, so they use natures fertiliser: manure. It does rather pong and if youre in a car, train or bus, it will hit you in the face like a slap with a trout. Ive gotten used to it over the years, but its been a long uphill struggle to get accustomed to it.Gossip and rumour. Because so little goes on in the rural communities, gossip is rife. There is a demand for people knowing other peoples business, regardless of how petty it is. Theres often a community clique. Sometimes the same people are in the neighbourhood watch, are school governors, run the PTA, belong to the WI, run the Brownies or scouts, etc, and if you don't fit in, both you and your family could get snubbed or at least treated differently to everyone else.Racism. There is a lack of diversity in the small communities, this can lead to scepticism of outsiders from the (mostly) older, close-minded generations. This is a simple fact of UK rural living, although it is quite literally dying out.Smaller schools. There maybe fewer pupils, but theres also less money for equipment, the classes are of a mixed age, theres the constant threat of closure.Cabin fever.Urban livingPollution. If you want to leave your abode for a walk or a short journey, theres no escaping it (unless perhaps you want to wear a gas mask). It covers the city in a noxious shroud, it covers buildings, it strangles trees and your lungs. Noise. There will always be an abundance of noise, group people together and theres all sorts of noise. Peace and quiet maybe hard to come by, but like manure, my brain will filter it out over time.People. Because there is a higher concentration of people, theres a higher concentration of weird people - the kind of people you probably wouldnt want to meet your mother. Theres also more homeless people vying for your attention. Theres little chance of getting away from prying eyes. There maybe more jobs, but there is also more people applying for jobsSecurity. The cities are home to digital prying eyes too - CCTV. If you have nothing to hide, personally I dont see it as a bad thing, but many people do.Cost Of Living. Expenses are high in the city. Owning or even renting a centrally located home can be many times more expensive than the rural counterparts (this is despite an increase in wages). Even living on the outskirts and commuting into the city centre can mount up over the course of a year (Oyster cards for zones 1-6 in London cost 2344 annually). Restaurants are typically more expensive, shopping is more expensive (without research), pubs and bars are more expensive etc.Crime. More people, more crime. This is a simple fact of city living. I mean, of course, theres crime in the rural communities, but there are fewer criminal gangs. CCTV and a police presence go some way to help control the gangs, but crime is still going to happen regardless.To conclude, at 32 years of age, I've had my fill of (semi) rural life. The cost of living vs wages problem has had a profound effect on my growing up. I'm about ready to move on to seek new opportunities and with determination and support I will find them. I will always have an affinity with nature, but I also love British culture, something that's sorely missing in this corner of the world. I can't face living here any longer without at least trying to make something of my life. Carpe diem."

S' Recently I was lucky enough to go the UK national fireworks competition, it was pretty spectacular. In fact, it was the best firework displays Id seen. Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang, has taken the humble firework display a step further by using gunpowder as a medium to create innovative art. A few months ago, he realised a project 21 years in the making. To pay tribute to his grandmothers 100th birthday, he utilised a giant balloon to create a 1,650 ft pyrotechnic sky ladder.Cai Guo-Qiang was also responsible for the spectacular Beijing Olympic opening ceremony in 2008. This makes him one of the only artists to have over 1 billion people simultaneously view his artwork.He has staged many explosion events worldwide and operates as a public performance that conjures violent chaos, ritual celebration and awe. Transient Rainbow (2002) - In which 1,000 three-inch multicolor peony fireworks fitted with computer chips were launchedRemembrance, chapter two of Elegy (2014) - ShanghaiProject for Hiroshima (2008) - Realised at Motomachi riverside park near the atomic bomb dome, Hiroshima, 60 seconds of black smoke shellsWreath (2011) - Part of 10 detonations called Black Ceremony near the city of Mathaf - QatarFourth sequence of explosion event Black Ceremony - QatarMystery Circle (2012) - Los AngelesAs well as creating massive outdoor explosions, Cai Guo-Qiang has created some spectacular indoor installations:Inopportune: Stage Two  (2004) - Depicting tigers with arrows pierced into their bodies creates a very visceral response. Even though its completely fake, the tigers are so realistically made that the audience feels pain upon viewing themHead On (2006) - Ninety Nine life-sized stuffed wolves barrel into a glass wall. They push on relentlessly, crashing with full force against the transparent barrierInopportune: Stage One (2004) - Nine cars arced through the 300 foot long gallery, tumbling and suspended in mid-air as if by stop-action.

S' One of my favourite French comedy films is Belleville Rendez-Vous (or to give it its official title The Triplets Of Belleville in everywhere else except the UK).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...The plot is quite simple: A grandmother discovers her grandsons fascination with bicycles from an early age, so she buys him one. Cut to years later, and he is now a contender for the Tour de France, with his grandmother still doting on him, now acting as his trainer. During the race itself he and other riders are kidnapped and taken to Belleville, so the grandmother and their enormously fat dog go looking for him. Without money or shelter, the two are discovered by three old women, former famous vaudevillians  The Triplets of Belleville. They invite her and the dog in to stay and help her attempt to rescue her grandson.All of the characters are hideous human caricatures - bodies are exaggerated to unrealistic proportions; this aids itself to the charm of the film. Its strictly in line with the original comic book by artist Sylvain Chomet and provides an original, antiquated visual style. Highly recommended.'

The first real virgin who sprung to mind was Mother Teresa. The Nobel Prize winning Catholic nun of Albanian origin, gave up her life to religion from the age of 12. She is one of the greatest humanitarians who ever lived. In 1950 she started her own mission called Missionaries of Charity. The work of this organization has spread all over the World. Through this organization Mother Teresa has provided food, medical aid, shelter and education to the poorest of the poor and neediest of the needy in nearly 100 countries all over the world.Here in the UK, we have our own (living) virgin: Ann Widdecombe, Conservative MP for Maidstone and The Weald.Ann is 67 and a self confessed virgin. In fact, she'll sue if anyone says she isn't.Joseph Merrick AKA The Elephant ManMr. Merrick lead a lonesome life due to his disfigurement, so for obvious reasons it was quite likely he died a virgin.According to the internet, Adolf Hitler, Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla, Queen Elizabeth I (the virgin queen), J.

S" ** Warning. This answer contains plot spoilers and pseudo-quotes sections from The Algebraist by Iain M. Banks. **Tl;DR The Archimandrite Luseferous from The AlgebraistOne of my all time favourite fictional characters is but a man, not some monster from the deepest dark pits of hell. Not some alien with five heads and twenty arms. Not a God or a fairy or an animal. Just a man. An evil, despicable, imaginative man. He has long, sheen-black straight hair and a naturally pale complexion, which had been skillfully augmented to make his skin nearly pure white. His eyes were artificially large, but just close enough to congenitally possible for people to be unsure whether they had been augmented or not. The whites beyond the black irises were a deep, livid red, and every one of his teeth had been carefully replaced with a pure, clear diamond, giving his mouth an appearance which varied from bizarre, mediaeval toothlessness to startling, glistening brilliance, entirely depending on the angle and light. He is: The Archimandrite Luseferous - warrior priest of the Starveling Cult of Leseum9 IV and effective ruler of one hundred and seventeen stellar systems, forty-plus inhabited planets, numerous significant artificial immobile habitats and many hundreds of thousands of civilian capital ships, who was Executive High Admiral of the Shroud Wing Squadron of the Four-Hundred-and-Sixty-Eigth Ambient Fleet (Det.) and who had once been Triumvirate Rotational human/non-human Representative for Cluster Epiphany Five at the Supreme Galactic Assembly.That is an enviable title that simultaneously works as a resume. The closest photo I could find is Ralf Fiennes as Amon Goeth from Schindlers ListSo why have I included a man as an imaginary creature? Because of his imagination. Being a warrior priest of the Starveling Cult makes him a target. Hes destroyed cities and planets to make a point. He revels in sociopathic sadism of the highest degree.This is why he deserves a place on this thread:In the days before the latest ongoing Chaos and the last, fading rumbles of the Disconnect Cascade, had some years ago caused the head of his once-greatest enemy, the rebel chief Stinausin, to be struck from his shoulders, attached without delay to a long-term life-support mechanism and then hung upside down from the ceiling of his hugely impressive study in the outer wall of Sheer Citadel - with its view over Junch City and Faraby Bay towards the hazy vertical slot that was Force Gap - so that the Archimandrite could, when the mood took him, which was fairly frequently, use his old adversary's head as a punchball. Stinausin had caused Luseferous enormous military and political difficulties before being defeated, difficulties which sometimes verged on being humiliations. There was deep resentment towards the traitor, which easily turned to anger when Luseferous looked upon the mans face, no matter how battered, bruised and bloody it might be (the heads augmented healing functions were quick, but not instantaneous), and so the Archimandrite probably still smashed away at Stinausins head with as much enthusiasm now as he had when he first hung there, years earlier. Stinausin, who had barely endured a month of such treatment before going completely mad, and whose mouth had been sewn up to stop him spitting at the Archimandrite, could not even kill himself, sensors, tubes, micropumps and bicircuitary prevented such an easy way out. Though by now perfectly insane, sometimes after an especially intense training session with the Archimandrite, when the blood trickled down from the one-time rebel chiefs split lips, re-broken nose and puffed-up eyes and ears, Stinausin would cry. This Luseferous found particularly gratifying. Of late, the Archmandrite had a new play-mate to amuse himself with. A nameless would-be assassin whose own teeth were slowly killing him. The assassin, a big, powerful-looking, leoninely human had been sent without weapons save for his specially sharpened teeth, with which, it had obviously been hoped by whoever sent him, he could bite out the Archimandrites throat. This he had attempted to do, a half-year earlier at a cerimonial dinner. The failed assassin had been both routinely, if savagely, tortured and then very carefully questioned under the influences of entire suites of drugs and electro-biological agents, but had given nothing useful away. Luseferous, who was that most of deplorable of beings, a psychopathic sadist with a fertile imagination, had decreed that the final punishment of the assassin should that of his own teeth - the weapons he had been sent wit, after all - should bring about his death. Accordingly, his four canine teeth had been removed, bioengineered to become tusks which would grow without ceasing, and reinserted. These great finger-thick fangs had erupted out of the bones of his upper and lower jaw, puncturing the flesh of his lips and had continued their remorseless growth. The lower set curved up and over his head and, after a few months worth of extension, came to touch his scalp near the top of his head, while the upper set grew in a scimitar-like paired sweep beneath his neck taking about the same time to meet the base of his throat. Both sets of teeth then started to enter the assassins body, one pair slowly forcing themselves through the bony plates of the mans skull, the other set entering rather more easily into the soft tissues of the lower neck. The fangs burrowing through his skull and into his brain were the ones which would shortly, and agonisingly, kill him. The unfortunate, nameless assassin had been unable to do anything to prevent this because he was pinned helpless and immobile against the wall of the chamber with hand and shackles of thick stainless iron, his nutrition and bodily functions catered for by various tubes and implants. His mouth had been sewn up, like that of Stinausin. For the first few months of his captivity the assassins eyes had followed Luseferous around the chamber with a fierce, accusatory look that the Archimandrite eventually grew to find annoying and so hed had the mans eyes stitched shut too.Luseferous had had his genitals enhanced in all sorts of ways. One improvement was that he carried glands inside his body which allowed him to produce many different secretions which his ejaculate could then carry into the bodies of others (but whose effects he was proof against, obviously), including irritants, hallucinogens, cannabinoids, capsainoids, sleeping draughts and truth serums. He went briefly into the little-death little-trance, the petit mal which allowed him to select one of these, and chose the last-mentioned, the truth drug. He took the girl anally; it was faster-acting that way... It emerged that she thought he was horribly ancient and weird-looking and a frightening, sick-minded old sadist and she absolutely hated being fucked by him. He thought about inseminating her with thanaticin, or employing one of the physical options his remade penis made possible: the shaved horsetail, perhaps. Or just injecting her into the vacuum and watching her die. In the end, Luseferous decided that letting her live with such constant degradation was punishment enough. He'd always said he preferred being despised, after all. He would make her his favourite. Probably wise to put her on suicide watch, too.There was a rasping noise and a heavy thump from inside the tank, followed by some almost inaudibly high keening sounds. Luseferous turned to watch the Recondite Splicer tear the giant leeches apart and eat them, violently shaking its great patchily brown head and tossing some bits of slimy black flesh all the way out of the tank. Once it had thrown a still-alive leech up and out of the tank and nearly hit the Archimandrite with it; Luseferous had chased the injured leech round the chamber with a shear-sword, cleaving deep slivers out of the dark red granite floor as he hacked and sliced at the creature. When the show in the tank was over, the Archimandrite turned back to the assassin. He put the elbow glove back on, picked another trunk-leech from the pot and strolled over to the man attached to the wall. Do you remember home, sir assassin? he asked as he approached. Is there any memory of it in your head at all, hmm? Home, mother, friends? He stopped in front of the man. Any of that stuff at all? He waved the leechs moist, seeking snout in front of the assassins face as he spoke. They sensed each other, the cold, writhing creature in the Archimandrites hand stretching out to try to fasten itself to the mans face, the man sucking breath through his nostrils and turning his head as far as it would go, seeming to try and shrink back into the wall behind (this would not be the first time the assassin had been introduced to a trunk-leech). The tusks digging into his chest prevented him from moving his head very far. Luseferous followed the movements of the mans head with the leech, keeping it in front of his lightly furred, leonine face, letting him smell the straining, quivering mass. Or did they rip out all those memories when they cleaned you, before they sent you to try to kill me? Huh? Are they all gone? Eh? He let the very tip of the trunk-leechs mouth parts just touch the fellows nose, causing the failed assassin to wince and jerk and make a small, terrified whimpering noise. What, eh? Do you remember home, eh, sport? A pleasant place to be, a place you felt safe and secure and with people you trusted, and who maybe even loved you? What do you say? Eh? Eh? Come on. The man tried to turn his head still further, straining the puckered skin around the puncture points on his chest, one of which started to bleed. The giant leech trembled in Luseferouss hand, stretching its mucus-tipped mouth parts still further as it tried to find purchase on the human males flesh. Then, before the leech could properly attach itself to the fellow, the Archimandrite pulled it back and let it hang from his half-outstretched arm, where it swung and twisted muscularly with what felt for all the world like genuine frustration.I like my home, he told the fellow quietly. I do, really. Everything Ive had to do, Ive done just to make things safer, to make home safer, to make everybody safer. He waved the trunk-leech towards what was left of the mans genitalia, but the leech seemed listless and the man already exhausted. Even the Archimandrite felt like some of the fun had gone out of the situation. He turned smartly and strode to the pot on the broad rail over the tank, dumping the leech inside and peeling the thick elbow glove off.We are serious, Luseferous told the Dwellers. He stood. Do you hear that noise? He turned his head, as though listening. The dull ticking noise went on; steady, remorseless. That is a drop-bomb chute, firing once a second. Only in this case it is firing people, not warheads. Unprotected human beings are being thrown into space towards your planet at a rate of over three thousand per hour. They are men, women and children, old and young adults, people from all walks of life, mostly captured from surrendering ships and damaged habitats. We have over twenty thousand of them aboard. They will continue to be fired at this rate until we make some sort of progress here. He waited for some sort of reaction from the three Dwellers, but they just kept on looking at the view. Now, he continued, do any of us here present think we might have just remembered anything useful? He watched the people and the aliens staring at the stippled line of black dots moving slowly away from the great ship. A few people turned to look at him, then looked away when he met their gaze, trying to hide hatred and fear and horror. Odd how people reacted so severely to something unpleasant happening right in front of them but were prepared to ignore much worse horrors taking place elsewhere. He is calculating and truly maliciously evil. I cant think of a villain who would go to such degradation just for his own malevolent gratification. He is pompous, over-the-top and unbelievable in his callous audacity. Not bad for just being a man."

S' Michael Pennington/ Johnny Vegas immediately springs to mind. Michael describes Johnny not so much as a character, but a voice inside his head. The Johnny Vegas character came from a place of failure. Success was his Kryptonite. For Johnny, if something went wrong with a set, it was because it was meant to go wrong and everyone else was too stupid to see it. He never wanted to play the big gigs, he hated to dumb it down for TV appearances, he loathed the PG Tips tea adverts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Originally Johnny Vegas was created as a way to help control the school bullies, but the witty retorts were always redirected internally. This soon changed as alcohol was introduced. Booze allowed Michaels inhibitions to be thrown aside as the unrestrained Johnny was unleashed upon the general public. The epitome of a Johnny moment was an impromptu reenactment of Crufts with a belt as a leash which lead to the finale of a poo on stage. All because a resident journalist admitted he usually reviews pet shows instead of comedy gigs.In the film Magic, Corky Withers (Anthony Hopkins) acquires a ventriloquist dummy called Fats to help with his magic act. Unfortunately, as Corky becomes more successful, events take a turn for the worst, (spoiler) Fats takes control of proceedings and kills several people. Michael was at the point where Johnny was seeping into his private life and the person he was killing was himself. Alcohol (apparently two bottles of vodka before a gig) was the key to his success, but this obviously isnt the key to good physical and mental health. Michael was put into a box when Johnny came out to play, but it was Michael who had the final say. In the end, his second marriage and the birth of his son Michael Pennington Jr was enough to put Johnny away forever. Comedy careerComedy occurred to him inadvertently. He made a debut as a contestant on the television show, Win, Lose or Draw in UK. It was during the show that he used the stage name, Johnny Vegas, which has stayed on with him since then.He made a brief appearance on Channel 4s 100 Greatest Stand Us and BBC Threes Almost Famous 2.It was in the mid-nineties that he took up residence in London with the intention of becoming a stand-up comedian. There, he was trained and mentored by Malcolm Hardee, the godfather of comedy. In 2001, he was the face of the advertising campaign for the launch of the ITV digital. However, the launch was a disastrous one given the fact that the puppet named Monkey, voiced by Ben Miller, gained all the limelight. In 2002, he made an appearance in the Dirk Maggs directorial Radio 4 sitcom Night Class, which he co-wrote with Tony Burgess and Tony Pitts. In the show, he played the character of a former Butlins redcoat teaching evening classes in pottery. The show gained a runner-up position at the Sony Radio Academy Awards. While continuing with his television show, he made a big break at the big screen with the feature film, The Virgin of Liverpool. Same year, he starred in other films such as Cheeky and Blackball. In 2004, he had three movies slated for release including Sex Lives of the Potato Men, Terkel in Trouble and The Libertine. Post Night Class, he followed up with the BBC3 sitcom, Ideal in 2005. He starred in a total of 53 episodes posing the character of Moz. Same year, he appeared in other television series, such as 18 Stone of Idiot, Bleak House, Dead Man Weds and ShakespeaRE-Told. In 2007, he yet again appeared in a television commercial for tea brand, PG Tips. Same year, he starred in the television series, Benidorm for 24 episodes. While he was a regular in the first three series, he was next seen in the sixth series. Year 2010 and 2011 saw him appear less on television. He made a guest appearance in one episode of Daves One Night Stand and was seen in 2 episodes of Celebrity Juice. 2012 was a packed year for this comedian as he starred in a couple of television shows including, Rude Tube, Moone Boy, A League of their Own and Mr Stink. In 2013, he was seen in the flick, The Harry Hill Movie. Additionally, he also made a television appearance, Have I Got News for You, Still Open All Hours and Never Mind the Buzzcocks The success of the entertainment world had a direct favourable impact on his first love, i.e. Pottery. He started receiving encouraging reviews for his work so much so that he was offered a role in Pot Shots, a film basically intended for an international audience. He was even offered to design a bottle of aftershave from Old Spice What sets Michael Pennington apart from other stand-up comedians was the fact that for most of his career the general public could see no discernible difference between the character hed created and the real man himself. The vast majority didnt know the real Michael Pennington and towards the end, nor did he.'

S' Having grown up through the 90s, I made a fair few fashion choices which may have been considered in vogue at the time, but maybe less so now. This doesnt mean I dont miss the baggy jeans and bomber jackets et al. Here are some examples of the 90s British fashion culture:Dready/Eclipse/Spliffy jeans:These were iconic. Little embroidered characters on massive, baggy jeans with huge leg length pockets. The look wouldnt be complete without the bottoms ripped and torn up from dragging through puddles and dog dirt. I also found water would soak up the legs to at least thigh height.Global Hypercolor T-shirts:The epitome of cool. I remember seeing these everywhere. I know they were a product of the 80s, but I live in an area far removed from modern culture. Back then, it took longer than usual for trends to catch on. I had an orange into yellow one. The problem was they also highlighted sweat marks - not a good look!N.A.S.A Nice And Safe Attitude bomber jackets:These are pretty rare now (probably because they may have been sued by the real NASA). Owning one of these jackets was like owning the Holy Grail. Record label merchandise was hot property back then, you just werent down with the kids unless you had Technics written across your chest. Kangaroo shoes: Apparently people would use the stash pocket to hide drugs. I used it to store my 50p pocket money. My pair were in the delightful colour combination of red, yellow and blue.The shell suit:Yes, I remember owning one these. Again, it was in red and yellow, but back in the early 90s the garishness was considered wholly acceptable. My mum told me I had to stop wearing mine after the world found out how combustible they were.Dummy necklace:Again, not know the drug connotation until much later, I had one of these necklaces. Being young and impressionable has a lot to answer for. Just because I wasnt old enough to go to raves didnt mean I couldnt wear the apparel (and paraphernalia it seems).Holographic sunglasses:During the 90s there was a holographic pandemic. Fashion was awash with a shiny, rainbow sheen. Everything from backpacks, to crop tops to shoes, to pencil cases were draped in space age holograms. I even remember my crisp packets were holographic. There seems to be some degree of 90s fashion revival at the moment, so I feel like I could wear most of these things again. Not because they look good - the 90s had some horrendous fashion disasters - but because they now have a certain level of retro appeal. I know I could walk out of my house in full 90s garb and garner some level of respect (or ridicule, I havent decided which).http://jnco.com/product-category...http://www.ebay.co.uk/bhp/alpha-...http://www.amazon.co.uk/KangaROO...http://www.for-sale.co.uk/shell-...https://www.etsy.com/uk/market/p...http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html...'

S' By keeping it simple.Generally, the part that makes a pizza heavy is the dough. The key to a light and tasty pizza is:Use as little (correctly proven) dough as possible Only a few high quality ingredientsCooked at a high temperature (preferably with a pizza stone)To prove pizza dough to an optimal level, its best to leave it somewhere warm (around 21C to 24C) overnight or until the dough has at least doubled in size. This is important as it creates good conditions for the yeast to break down the starch into sugar for it too consume. The biproducts from this are carbon dioxide and alcohol. The alcohol evaporates and the carbon dioxide creates holes which provides airpockets and gives the dough a nice and light texture.Try using a little passata with only a couple of high quality ingredients such a santos tomatoes with buffalo mozzarella, green or red pesto with some fresh basil and a little garlic oil, cracked black pepper and oregano to season. Keeping it simple will ensure the different taste combinations are complimenting instead of cancelling eachother out. Also, stacking a pizza with too many ingredients will cause it to be burnt on top, yet raw on the bottom. Not a good combination.Another component to a tasty pizza is ensuring its cooked at a high temperature. The dough and toppings will slightly char after about five minutes and will create a lovely smoky taste.Three other aspects which you may want to investigate in is:1) Not using any cheese whatsoever. Yep.. Without cheese, the taste of your ingredients are enhanced (especially with seasoning). Cheese will leave your pizza soggy and oily whilst at the same time killing the taste. A popular pizza I make is a Pianta:Arrabbiata sauce on the base (passata, chilli flakes, parsley and garlic oil)ArtichokesChestnut MushroomsPine NutsBlack OlivesFinished with: Rocket and Olive OilSimple, but oh so tasty. 2) Cut a hole in the middle of the pizza and fill it with salad mix. Less dough, healthy and nutritious (although I always prefer a little dressing).3) Reroll the dough. For this technique you need some overproven dough: Its now more than double in size, it maybe starting to smell like old beer (thats the yeast fermenting the dough) and looking slightly discoloured. To create the best dough, you need to fold the edges back into themselves and reshape the dough back into a ball. Youre quite literally turning it inside out. This traps air and creates the lightest, tastiest base you can get. I highly recommend it if you have a day spare to prepare it. Enjoy!'

S' To accompany David Stewart\'s answer, a more recent update to Yes Minister is The Thick Of It.As a gritty, satirical comedy, The Thick Of It succeeded in not only being truly scathing and close to the bone, but also as a surprisingly accurate (The Thick Of It: When life imitates sweary art - BBC News) portrayal of British politics - "The truth is actually much more terrifying: we\'re making it up as we go along. Just like they are."Each episode is semi-improvised and, at points, unrehearsed. This makes the whole thing feel oh so real as situations unfold. You can see cast members squirm under the ruthless, foul mouthed heart and soul of the show: Malcolm Tucker - Peter Capaldi (AKA Dr. Who).The show was created by Armando Iannucci after arguing the case for Yes Minister as best British sitcom. A limited budget was granted and a short three episode series aired on BBC4 in 2005. Popularity grew quickly and the show flourished into 4 series, plus special episodes and a spin off film called In The Loop. The series has been the recipient of a number of awards, particularly from BAFTA. Series 1 won both "Best Situation Comedy" and Chris Langham won "Best Comedy Performance  male" at the 2006 BAFTA Television Awards, with Peter Capaldi being nominated for the same award in 2006 and 2008. Capaldi won the BAFTA at the 2010 awards, with Rebecca Front winning "Best Comedy Performance  female". The series was also declared the "Best Situation Comedy."The series also won Best Situation Comedy from the Royal Television Society in 2006 and 2010 and won Broadcasting Press Guild Awards in 2006 and 2010 for best sitcom and writing team.https://youtu.be/DaMb-5w-V0YThe definitive Malcolm Tucker (contains glorious swearing)'

S' I have always been jealous of creative types. Jealous in the wonder and awe way and jealous in the way that stings a little. Creative people are just so damn cool. They somehow pull off with great je ne sais quoi this unnatural combination of being totally carefree but also very hardworking, and incredibly passionate yet very down-to-earth and centered. A very cool bunch. I am not one of these people. I am sort of the opposite of one of these people. I recently received a wedding invite that instructed me to RSVP with a Haiku. I full-on panicked and wondered how I could be friends with people so callous and cruel. I\'ve never even liked cartoons or fantasy anything. So "creative mode" isn\'t where I naturally hang out and it takes a little cajoling to get myself there. But, even as a mere mortal non-creative type, there are things I can do to "get there" when I want to create.Have you noticed how a weekend getaway with your beloved can kick your love life up a notch or four? For me, a big part of this is being away from the tedium of everyday life and my real life stresses - even the smallest, most insignificant ones. The dishes piling up in the sink. The dinner or lunches that have to be made. The bills that have to be paid. The pets or children that have to be cared for. The mile long to-do list that hasn\'t been touched. Out of sight, out of mind is pure bliss sometimes. This bedroom/love life theory applies for me when I want to create something. Except that I don\'t need to check into a hotel somewhere tropical and no sexy lingerie is required. I just need to get out of my regular environment and away from those small, everyday stresses. I think that there is a thick layer of everyday anxiety between me and my creative potential.Getting outside and exercising also helps me clear this thick, suffocating layer of everyday anxiety that stifles my creative potential. I\'m not talking about going crazy and running a marathon or climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro. It\'s the simple things like getting my hands in the garden dirt or feeling the sun on my back while I walk on a peaceful trail. Or floating in the ocean or throwing the ball for my dog in the park. This is when my mind wanders to those fantastic places where creativity is alive and boundless. Those places that make my husband tremble in fear when I come home and say, "guess what I\'m gonna do, honey, isn\'t this a GREAT IDEA?!!" While I will (probably) never set out to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, I do pay careful attention to how I\'m spending my energy when I want to create. I\'m an introvert, but I unfortunately spend a lot of time in denial about my introverted nature. Much like a woman of 50 who dresses like she\'s 20. When I want to create something, I really focus on being mindful of how much energy the creative process takes and that I can\'t spend my energy on friends or elsewhere. This is a very key part of my creating process. Some might call this "hermit mode". I will probably always be jealous of the uber-cool creative types who make it all look so easy. But until I can morph into one of these creative superheros, I will continue using my creative process hacks for the not-so-creatively-inclined.'

S' I was 8 years old when I first visited the orthodontist. Either my mother truly didn\'t know or she just didn\'t have the heart to tell me, that I would be seeing a whole lot of the man over the next 10 years. I remember sitting in his office that day, staring down at my well-worn Keds and then up at all of his diplomas, as he explained to my mother that my case was, "very interesting." That is orthodontist code for, "You\'re going to wear a hideous, torturous contraption in your ugly mouth FOOOREEEEVER." I imagined an evil cackle after this, of course.Like acne or bad hair or painfully awkward moments with the opposite sex, braces are a rite of passage. Braces are the prepubescent equivalent of putting in your time doing grunt work and earning your stripes. Most people, however, can get away with putting in only one or two years in braces. I was given an unusually punitive 10-year sentence. When you have braces you join an extremely large sorority or fraternity of people who understand the painfully awkward initiation that you are going through and can empathize. These are the same people who will look back at your photos with you later and smile with you. When you have braces you learn that so-called "treats" like candy or cookies can become horror-filled minefields of embarrassment rivaled only by an adolescent period mishap. More than once I bravely flirted with my crush-du-jour only to later realize that my Oreo dessert never made it to my stomach and was caught in my braces like a rat in a trap. So long, dignity. It\'s a good thing that you wave buh-bye to your dignity early on in your braces saga, because when you have braces you learn that your parents care more about their $200 investment in your retainer than your dignity. There is absolutely no dignified or non-gross way to take out your retainer to eat lunch with your cooler-than-you (as they always are) friends. Removing a drool covered piece of plastic and metal from your piehole is just always gross. And it\'s even grosser and less dignified when you have to go digging for it in a dumpster after you throw it away. Which you inevitably will. It WILL happen. And your parents will make you dig for it. And it will probably be taco day or lasagna day or sloppy joe day.Not everything about having braces was bad, though. If I had been born with beautiful teeth (okay, or even just decent teeth) I wouldn\'t have gotten to miss school for all of those orthodontist appointments which was a ritual that I secretly loved. My mother would take me out for a strawberry milkshake after my appointments at a little cafe, which was a rare treat and more time out of school. I have never met anyone who dislikes having straight teeth or complains that they wish they didn\'t have straight teeth. Even in spite of the spontaneously snapping rubber bands, awkward kisses, slobbery, lost retainers, and bad pictures, straight teeth always win. I do know people who have many regrets about refusing to have braces. And the memories that were once brutally embarrassing and made me turn red in the face really do become less embarrassing with time and take on more of a fond, coming-of-age tone that makes me smile my very straight smile.'

S' Absolutely. I definitely qualify as an introvert and I worked in both in-house and agency public relations. As with most jobs, there were parts of my job that I loved and parts of my job that I was less enthusiastic about. I loved writing press releases and drafting pitches and doing research. I was less enthusiastic about making calls to editors or talking to television producers or attending cocktail parties. While I got the job done well, these calls and meetings and parties drained much more of my energy than they did for many of my extroverted coworkers who fed off of these activities like leprechauns on clover. While loving every single aspect of your job isn\'t a realistic requirement, I think it\'s important to take a careful, honest inventory of your strengths and weaknesses, what is a source of energy for you and what drains your energy, the type of environment and people you work well with, and so forth. "Communications" encompasses *a lot* of jobs. Just in PR, for example, there are very specialized jobs that focus on things like writing or media training to broader, generalist positions.'

S' I am one of those women who accepted the traditional ring but did not take her husband\'s name. We spent a long time talking about rings and discussing rings before we purchased them and, likewise, we made the names decision together too. I didn\'t "refuse" to take his name, it was a thoughtful joint decision.I don\'t think that we were being hypocritical by going "cafeteria style" with our wedding choices. We chose together as a couple how we wanted our wedding and marriage to look and feel and what traditions we wanted to participate in or not. We were active participants in shaping our marriage and relationship, rather than passive observers of ancient customs. When we mindlessly observe ancient customs designed around antiquated social thought, we are both paying homage to our forebears and passing up the chance to create our own, more relevant and meaningful traditions. So what you are calling hypocrisy was, for us, about creating genuineness and meaning.'

S' It is tough to communicate to Western Quorans that driving is unnecessary because sometimes it\'s not unnecessary and sometimes there aren\'t better choices. Sometimes there are better choices, of course. I grew up in a very small, rural town in Washington state that was about an hour away from the nearest urban center. There was no public transportation. I did take the school bus to the public school and that was a 45 minute ride each way after a 1 mile walk to the bus stop. Residents relied on their cars to get to work and to retrieve groceries and other necessities.When I was in my 20\'s I moved to the Bay Area for a job in San Francisco. While I did have a car, I chose not to drive into work on a daily basis as it was much easier and more economical to take public transportation. I could have gotten by without a car entirely, but I am glad that I chose to have a car as it allowed me to easily take weekend trips to Napa or to the coast. A car also made little errands like getting groceries easier and more convenient. It was indeed a luxury to have a car and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I think it\'s a bit problematic to make a sweeping statement like "driving is unnecessary" when your audience includes very remote places with no public transportation at all and large urban centers with arguably advanced public transportation networks and more and more alternative choices like Uber and Lyft. Rather than trying to convince such a heterogeneous audience that driving is patently unnecessary, have you tried asking other probing questions so that you might better understand the motivations? Like why people might choose to live in the suburbs and spend a long time commuting rather than living in the city where they work? Or why people might choose not to carpool? Why a family might need two cars? What has stopped public transportation from being better/more efficient? Can you take a stroller on a public bus? There are a lot of layers to your problem statement.'

All sorts of possibilities and anxieties run through my head like a ticker tape - I might embarrass myself or fall flat on my face or just be plain ol' bad. But then some small part of me remembers that my mom continues to learn and try new things all the time and it makes her a better person and I try.

S' I was 7 years old the first time that I heard the phrase "old soul". I was confused about what it meant then and, admittedly, I\'m still a little confused. My bighearted Midwestern mother, who loves any excuse for a get-together or a potluck, convinced me that I would love a big sleepover party for my birthday. I knew better, of course, but I got swept up in the magic and excitement of the matching My Little Pony paper plates and pink streamers and the anticipation of cake and presents dancing in my head. When party day finally came, my My Little Pony dreams disintegrated into my worst nightmare of 15 little girls running quickly and wildly around my house, shrieking in high-pitched tones, and playing schoolyard teasing games.My mom was right, sort of. My friends were loving the birthday party. Their joy was abundantly obvious and barely containable. I was the only one not enjoying the party. I slunk upstairs to my bedroom and plopped down on my bunk with despair and that\'s where my mom and I had the old soul conversation while inertia kept everything going downstairs. I let out a heavy, exasperated sigh and listened to her through my almost-tears. She knew that I was social and loved having fun and being with friends, but that fun to me was a great conversation, or game, or interesting movie - a different kind of "fun" than my peers enjoyed at this age. I sniffled as she explained to me that I am an "old soul" which she said means that I have a richer understanding of the world and greater maturity than many of my peers do. That I am wise beyond my years. While I understood intellectually what my mother was telling me, it didn\'t quite fit with what I was feeling, and so I was more confused than comforted. I felt lonely. Existentially lonely. I didn\'t feel wise or mature or like I understood anything. I felt like everyone was playing a game of musical chairs and I was the one who was always left without a chair. The one who didn\'t belong. As I have traveled through life I have been accused of being an old soul several more times (by people other than a mother desperate to soothe her daughter\'s tears). I still have trouble - more than 25 years later - reconciling the feeling of existential loneliness with this positive construct of being an "old soul". An old soul who has more wisdom and maturity and vision. Are they two sides of the same coin?'

S' There are surely exceptions, but I think it\'s generally unwise to put your life on hold until you achieve whatever goal or milestone it is you have in mind. It can be quite a slippery slope. "I will start dating when I am self-supporting" can quickly turn into "I will start dating when I make above x dollars per year and I can attract a better woman." I have fallen into this trap a time or two myself and have more than a few regrets. There was a time in my life when I was quite overweight and I told myself that I would socialize more when I lost weight or I would buy clothes when I lost weight. While I\'m sure that some people take dating to the extreme even in college with fancy dinners and ski vacations and gifts, this is the exception not the rule. Cook spaghetti together or take a picnic to the beach. Attend parties together. Take in a cheap movie. Volunteer somewhere together. There are countless things to do that don\'t involve emptying your wallet (or your parent\'s wallet). If it is your parents who are subsidizing your life right now, have you thought about why they might be doing this? When I talk to parents about why they pay for their children\'s educations I get all sorts of reasons, but the gist is usually to help to them get a really great head start on their adult life. These parents are looking to give their children an advantage, not to hinder their social lives. It\'s possible that they would be quite sad and surprised to discover that you have shut down an entire aspect of your life on their account.

S' Dating is notoriously unfun for a reason. A person who isn\'t dating might look at themselves in the mirror and think, "I could probably stand to see the inside of a gym more often, but I\'m not doing too badly overall." A person who is actively seeking love might glance into the mirror and never climb out because they are too busy picking out so-called flaws. That invisible wrinkle on their brow, pores that are too large, a hair or three that need to be waxed, not enough fat here or too much fat there, not enough muscle here or too much muscle there, not enough hair up top or too much hair down there -- the list is as endless as a hall of mirrors. But there is good news.It\'s highly likely that your potential date is suffering from this same syndrome. That she picks at her own so-called flaws and worries that her legs aren\'t shapely enough or that she has a bit of a muffin top or that her cheeks are a bit too round. Or maybe it\'s that she has too many freckles or that her hair is too wavy or too curly or that her skin isn\'t clear enough. Either way, why is someone else\'s suffering good news? How is that possible? Because it\'s quite likely that she isn\'t picking you apart in her mind at all - she\'s thinking about her own self-perceived flaws just like you\'re thinking about your own flaws. Many women are attracted to confidence, so I would spend some time practicing projecting confidence (even if you don\'t feel confident). Good posture is part of projecting confidence.'

S' I wouldn\'t worry overly much about this or make any changes to the list that you have already submitted and shared with your coworkers. I would move on and consider making a change next time. When I receive requests for general feedback and suggestions I keep a few things in mind: The first thing that I keep in mind is that everything is someone\'s job. So if I\'m suggesting a change to something, it\'s possible that the someone who is in charge of that something will take offense. Everyone is different, but some people are quite sensitive to calls for change to things that they "own". They might feel as if you are saying to them personally, "you\'re doing a bad job". With this in mind, when I do offer suggestions, I do not share them with coworkers and I prefer to submit them anonymously. Let\'s say that I\'m making a suggestion about the annual holiday party. Even if I\'m not speaking directly with someone on the holiday party committee, both viruses and gossip spread pretty quickly around offices. When I give feedback I choose to limit myself to my top few suggestions because I don\'t want my employer or whomever it might be to mistakenly assume that I am not happy or disgruntled. While I might be a perfectly content employee with merely a lot of great ideas for improvement, if I submit an overly long list of opportunities for improvement, it\'s possible that my employer will incorrectly assume that I\'m quite dissatisfied. Finally, I like to keep the attention span of my audience in mind. While each of your ideas might be absolutely, stunningly fabulous, it\'s possible that a consultant will go cross-eyed reading a really long list and your best ideas will be lost. Keeping it brief gives your best ideas the best chance.'

S' Planning a wedding can be ridiculously stressful. By the time that I said "I do" most of my friends had already gotten married, so I had a chance to witness just how crazy wedding day details can become. A few times brides lost it over minutia like our nail polish colors matching just so. This isn\'t because they were petty or even inconsiderate people (quite the opposite), it\'s because the enormous stress got to them in those moments and they lost perspective. It\'s easy to let the stress get to you and to lose perspective when you\'re planning a large, life-changing event. It happens to the best of us, and it\'s also why I took the easy way out and had a teeny, tiny wedding with no attendants.My friendships have definitely changed over time. They have changed with marriages or babies or school or moves or jobs. I suspect that they will continue to change. This isn\'t a bad thing, I don\'t think, but it does take some adjusting. And change is hard for me. Adjusting to this change was most difficult for me in my mid- to late-20\'s. All of my friends were getting married and starting families and their new families were now the main focus of their time and energy and attention as opposed to their friendships and social lives. It was a big switch. I wouldn\'t throw the baby out with the bathwater though. Just because priorities shift, doesn\'t mean that she no longer values your friendship. It is important to be honest with yourself about your expectations for your bridesmaids. Do you expect them to be really involved with the day-to-day wedding prep and planning? To come to all of your dress fittings and help with putting together all of the wedding favors? To shop for matching shoes and hair accessories and nail polish? If so, you might both end up unhappy and bitter...and not friends.

S' Relationships with parents are difficult. Especially when we feel that we have contrasting ideologies, perspectives, or goals. And especially when we are living under the same roof. Most parents will always want to put in their two cents and exert their influence, but it gets easier to deal with this as you gain independence over time. Maybe sometimes in your life you will welcome a little parental "love" and sometimes you will nod along and grin at brunch but later ignore their advice. But, back to your question, what should you do now? As hard as it is (and, trust me, I know this is hard), try and keep your eye on the bigger picture. You say that it is not possible for you to be truly happy at this private school. Is it possible for you to be truly happy if there is strife in your home? Is it possible for you to be happy if your parents always trust you less because they feel that you made the wrong choice? Why is it not possible for you to be happy at private school? Is it a choice between happy or not happy or could you find ways to be happy? Take the time to carefully think through all of the angles of this decision. Are there really only two choices? Would it be possible to enroll in the private school on a one or two year trial basis? Would it be possible to maintain some of the aspects of your life that you enjoy so much about public school and still attend private school? Think outside the box and be creative. Try not to get caught up thinking that public school is "good" and private school is "bad".When making this decision you might also want to think about your long term goals. Remember that these are not your parents goals, they are your goals. Where do you want to go to college and what do you want to do after college? Which school will help you achieve your goals and reach your dreams? If you don\'t know, do some research. You could even ask here on Quora. Sometimes we have to work hard to create our own happiness in the short term for the sake of our long term goals.'

S' When I was in preschool I told my mother, "You go to college and then you go to work. Then you get married and have kids. Then you die." My mother laughs heartily about this, but I knew even at 4 years old that I was expected to attend college. That there was no choice. As it turns out, I did go to college, then I started my career, then I got married, and now I\'m having a child, but I digress... The sense of obligation that I felt to attend college was very real and, at the time, a real burden and source of trouble in my life. I struggled a lot (understatement) during that time in my life and I mistakenly assumed that I was miserable because I did not get to make any real choices for myself. It was college or college.I was directionless and bitter and I chose to behave like a petulant toddler for quite a few years. I drifted in and out of majors and various mischievous antics. I finally graduated six years and six years of summer courses later (and a few sternly worded emails from my parents). Years later when I had settled into a job and a life and into my own skin, I realized that my malcontent during my college years wasn\'t owed to being forced to go to college - it was owed to having to grow up. Growing up is actually pretty hard and all sorts of uncomfortable and awkward. Maybe I was just particularly behind the curve, but I had to learn a lot in college and only a small percentage of that was from a textbook. I realize now that college is a wonderful, insular environment in which to do that kind of learning. But hey, it\'s very possible that you\'re absolutely nothing like me and that you have nothing to discover or learn about yourself. I suppose that some people just have their stuff together (wait - don\'t most people think that they are one of those people?). If this is the case, I would focus on getting a degree that complements what you really want to do. Spend your time and energy developing relationships in the industry that you want to work in.'

S' Have you ever imagined that your life might be a little bit better or easier in some way if you just had that something? That something that your friend has or the person in the magazine, maybe, and you imagine how wonderful their life is because of it? If you were just 10lbs thinner, you would have a much easier time attracting all of the attractive guys or girls. If you just made 10k more a year, you could live in that desirable neighborhood with the desirable people and their desirable friends. If you just had 10 more IQ points, you could go to a better college and get a better job. If you were just 10 centimeters taller, you could kill it at sports and command more respect at your job. There are countless "somethings" that people torture themselves over and women bemoaning their physical features is one more something. While almost none of the somethings that we subject ourselves to are going to make our lives more wonderful, some women might imagine that having a more petite nose, for example, might somehow make her more glamorous and her life more fabulous or that having perfect skin will make her life easier. Glancing around at the little, micro-tidbits of other people\'s lives that we see on social media or the carefully curated ad campaigns that we are bombarded with, it\'s easy to get caught up thinking that "somethings" are the cure for what ails us. We easily slip into thinking that changing our hair or our nose will change our life, just like it\'s easy to think that changing our popularity or bank balance will make us happy.'

To the contrary, statistics show that the sales-seekers are from a pretty equal distribution of income brackets. Outrage about Black Friday is not a form of classism, it\'s a type of elitism akin to hating on suburbs or the "I\'m too good to own a television" crew.

S' Gaining a foothold in an established social group can be a really tricky proposition. I have been in your shoes and I know just how lonely and awkward this can feel. You will most likely be "the newcomer" a few times again in your life, so it\'s probably best to think it through and consider your options. I ran into this situation as a student like you, but also when I started new jobs or joined a yoga group or club. You might find that when you have kids all of the PTA moms and dads have known each other for a million years or that all of the t-ball parents are super tight. While there isn\'t only one right or correct approach, there are some things that you might want to keep in mind as you decide how you want to ingratiate yourself.Beware coming on too strong.  Not only will this turn your potential new friends off, but it\'s not fair to you, either. It\'s ridiculously easy to get swept up in the glamour and magic of the charismatic popular people who have somewhere to go and somewhere to be, but give yourself time to decide if these are people whom you actually like and have things in common with or not. It\'s possible that these are people that you don\'t want to eat dinner with or spend a lot of quality time with and would prefer to maintain a more casual, but friendly, relationship. Give yourself a chance to decide before you jump on the bandwagon. Get to know who you want to know. Let\'s say, for giggles, that there are 30 students in your class. Even if you like all 30 of them (which is rather unlikely - they probably don\'t even all like each other), chances are that you don\'t want to be best friends or even close friends with all 30 of them. Giving yourself time to get to know the group and group dynamics a bit before you angle to be included gives you time to get to know who you want to know better. Once you meet and get to know a few people whom you would like to know better, think about asking them to coffee before class. Invite them to grab a coffee before your class or something else casual that doesn\'t interfere or intrude upon their post-class dinner plans. You don\'t want to inadvertently ask them to choose between their group plans, doing something with you, or inviting you along to the group event. Placing people in awkward situations is never a good way to win friends. Think long term. Not tonight\'s dinner. It\'s really painful to go home by yourself and feel the brutal sting of exclusion when you know that everyone is having a fabulous time at dinner. Is your end goal to form real, lasting friendships or to join in on one dinner? Forming friendships takes time and it\'s highly likely that if you become friends with a few people in the group that they will include you in the larger group activities. This should not be your goal in befriending a few individuals, of course. The friendships should be the goal in and of themselves. Remember that while it\'s often important to be a part of the group for political reasons at work or school, it\'s more important to be friends with people that we truly enjoy being friends with and enrich our lives. When you do join this social group please extend a dinner invite to the next newcomer to your class. I\'m sure they will appreciate it.'

S" If you want to pursue a friendship with this person, you might be happier if begin by choosing activities that are lighter on conversation and heavier on experiences. Select activities that don't emphasize conversation, but allow the two of you to build a shared history that will eventually give you things to talk about other than television. Take a yoga class together, for example, or go to a concert. Trivia nights are another option or paint nights. There are a lot of possibilities. There are plenty of reasons why someone might focus on discussing non-personal things or might not feel comfortable disclosing personal things in the early stages of a friendship. It doesn't really matter why. Rather than focusing on what they aren't talking about, focus on getting to know them better first in a different type of environment. If you aren't satisfied with the level of disclosure as time goes on, you are not obligated to pursue the friendship or you can simply keep the friendship very casual."

S" Rather than trying to determine if you are getting the same dollar-for-dollar benefits as your coworkers, try thinking about this question from an employer's point of view. You will almost always lose when you play the tit-for-tat game. Someone is going to take more sick days than you, someone is going to use more dental or health insurance benefits, someone is going to consume more of those sugar packets offered near the coffee machine, or eat more shrimp at the employee retreat. If you shift your view and consider how you might lure in and keep employees if it were your company, your perspective might change a bit. Ultimately, employers want to attract, hire, and retain good employees. Most employers also care about each of their employees and want to promote their health and well-being (which also serves goal number one). One way to attract good employees is to offer benefits that good employees want. Great maternity and paternity leave benefits fall squarely into this category. Maternity and paternity benefits aren't designed as a slight to non-parents just as offering vegetarian options in the cafeteria isn't designed as a slight to carnivores or offering a health club membership isn't designed as a slight to the workout averse. Almost all companies offer more benefits than any one person can take advantage of simply because they design benefits to attract many types of people. Many employers also offer a paid sabbatical which is a benefit that you do not need to be a new or expecting parent to utilize. So some companies do offer a somewhat comparable benefit. Even if your company does not offer a sabbatical, you might still come out ahead in the endurance race. Sometimes new parents who take long leaves or vacations are overlooked for promotions or raises, depending on the company culture. Take a good look at your company's benefits portfolio and seek out the benefits that were designed to attract you."

S" Wine country is mostly rural, agriculture country. Wine grapes are a crop, after all. While Napa Valley is a relaxing and picturesque place to unwind with a glass of cab franc, it lacks the urban density that makes jetting around on a bike or public transport super easy and convenient. So long as you plan to have a designated driver, a car will get you everywhere that you need to go.Many of the budget hotels ($250 dollars/night) offered on popular online travel deal sites are not in the town of Napa proper but in adjacent towns like American Canyon. If you want to spend the day exploring the small town of say, St. Helena - visiting tasting rooms, Woodhouse Chocolate, having a meal - it's possible to do this all via slightly inebriated cycling. However, you need to get there first and you need to get back to wherever you are staying. American Canyon to St. Helena is a 45 minute car ride. Same goes for towns like Yountville. Most wineries are rather spread out which makes cycling a poor choice if there are specific wineries that you would like to visit. And don't forget that the terrain is very hilly in places. Don't be surprised if you feel a little car sick winding around the steep roads. Cycling is probably not the ideal main mode of transport choice for the casual tourist, but definitely a fun thing to do for entertainment if you have the time one afternoon.If everyone in your group would like to have a drink or four you might consider a tour. If your group is considering joining a larger tour keep in mind that not all wineries warmly welcome tour buses and their groups. You might find that you have a better experience at wineries if you hire a private driver for your group and keep it small. If you are not warmly welcomed you might not be able to taste as many wines and the tasting room attendant might not spend as much time giving your group special attention or even occasionally a discount. Sometimes it's worth it to pay a little bit more for a better experience.The wine train is nice, but not as a mode of transportation. It's the equivalent of taking a dinner cruise on a boat. You don't generally take a dinner cruise to get from point A to point B, you take a dinner cruise for the boat ride, the scenery, and the meal. And, sometimes, because it's a work obligation. The wine train works pretty much the same way. Scenery, food, and train ride (the meal is pretty good, btw).A car is your wine country best bet. Take turns being designated driver and mix it up now and then with bike rentals, a tour/hired driver, and the wine train."

S' We love to love nostalgia and to fondly recall our childhood school days. No worries, no stress, not a care in the world, we say. Nothing but kittens and neighborhood pals and warm fuzzies. But there are things that nostalgia overlooks. A few of them:Sleep: Most teenagers are wired to stay up later and sleep in later than the average adult. This means that when the school bell rings at 7am sharp, students are already operating on a sleep deficit. Chronic sleep deprivation brings with it a host of troubles. Sleep deprivation interferes with almost all aspects of health and development, including mental health, relationships, and academic performance. Losing out on sleep alone could color a student\'s outlook on school. Autonomy: When was the last time you had to ask for permission to use the restroom? When you have a horrible boss do you have the choice to leave if you find a different job? Students have shockingly little autonomy, yet crave autonomy just as much as you or I do. Personal freedom and choices - even if they are false choices - make us feel better about ourselves. "Darn Kids!!": Do you remember sitting in those uncomfortable little wooden chairs? Recall the dismal offerings in the cafeteria? Wouldn\'t it have been fantastic if schools offered the same ergonomic work stations and fantastic break rooms that corporations build to lure and retain the best workers? Until most k-12 school have either a serious infusion of cash or a major incentive to build nap pods and bring in world-class chefs for their students, I suspect uncomfortable chairs and cardboard pizza Tuesdays it will be. And I suspect students will go on disliking this.Growing Pains: School is an awkward time for most kids, from the band geek to the cheerleader. So while you\'re sleep-deprived, have very little control over your own life, and navigating an uncomfortable school environment, you are also trying to figure out who you are and where you fit in to the absurd, hormonally-charged mess that is the social scene. Also, how to deal with the zits on your face.It\'s great to wax nostalgic, but there are a lot of really good reasons that kids don\'t like being students.'

S' I am an introvert who occasionally dresses up as an extrovert. Like most things in moderation - exercise, trashy television, tourist attractions, Starbucks holiday drinks - I enjoy socializing in moderate amounts. Over the years and through some disastrous social experiences, I have learned that if I am going to continue to enjoy socializing I need to take steps to set myself up for success. For me, and I suspect for other reserved introverts out there, this means not volunteering to be part of the welcoming committee and the unofficial ice-breaking crew at parties. Bless the people who do this, but this is not a great job for reserved introverts to sign up for. If you arrive at a party at the time designated on the invitation you are, perhaps unwittingly, signing up for the welcoming committee. When you ring the doorbell at the stroke of 7pm, you are saying to your host that you are "that guy". "That guy" bellows a warm welcome to newcomers and integrates them smoothly into the conversation. He insists that they get a drink. He makes them feel welcome and special. I am great at radiating nervous energy and not so great at ice breaking antics or warmly instructing people to grab a glass of wine. No host wants me on their welcoming committee. It\'s much better for all involved for me to show up fashionably late after everyone has had a few of those glasses of wine and I can slink into the crowd. Most reserved introverts have cat-like crowd-slinking reflexes. No bellowing or cheek-kissing needed. Speaking of cheek-kissing, it\'s also in an introvert\'s best interest to leave before the pack if they wish to avoid the awkward obligatory hugging and child-kissing. To maximize social reward, reserved introverts often do well arriving fashionably late. While it may seem counter-intuitive, it makes it easier, not harder, to fit in.'

S' The need for more than a simple polite apology usually arises after an emotionally charged event. While most of us go on autopilot and remember without conscious thought that it\'s appropriate to apologize after you bump into someone accidentally or spill something, it\'s really difficult to access that same mental cheat sheet and gain perspective in the hours or days immediately following a highly charged emotional tussle. It is important to be acutely aware that when you are in the thick of it your judgment is clouded by your pride and fear and the sting of things that were said and not said. When the dust is just starting to settle on the battlefield, try thinking about what you want out of the relationship and what your long term goals are for the relationship. Don\'t focus on whether or not you are sorry that you said that Janet\'s mother nags too much. Examining your relationship as a whole often has the ancillary benefit of improving your perspective on the event. Do you really want to draw a line in the sand (or set up a fort on the sofa) over x? How important is this? Maybe a lot, but maybe not so much.Sometimes apologies aren\'t about us and our rightness or personal sense of justice. In the give and take of a relationship, occasionally an apology will be just about the other person\'s needs and that\'s okay. Apologies help people to save face and that\'s important. When we love and respect people, helping them to save face and saving face ourselves is part of the relationship tango. This is part of the idea behind an "act of contrition". Being contrite isn\'t necessarily *always* about being woefully and excessively ashamed of what you have said or done, but about understanding and caring for your partner\'s needs and the needs of the relationship. If you can find something genuine to apologize for that is ideal, of course, but think of the bigger picture too.'

S' Dating is rough, isn\'t it? The women that I know invest a lot in an evening out with a man, even if they don\'t pay the dinner tab at the end of the evening. Dates are such a big investment of time, money, and emotional energy that I don\'t know a single person who would accept a dinner invitation simply for the gratis overcooked steak. The women I know would be more than happy to stay home and eat leftovers in sweatpants rather than spend a terrible evening with Mr. Wrong.You know how nice women look on dates? That pretty dress, those heels, her hair styled just so? This all takes time, money, and effort. When I was younger my friends and I would help each other get ready for dates. We weren\'t saying to one another, "This is the date that you said yes to for the food, right? Are you going to order the lobster?" We were asking about her feelings for the guy. What he was like. How the date had been set up. How she had been feeling since her date with Mr. Chews With Open Mouth. Even though you are only saying "yes" to sharing a few hours together, the emotional investment and potential messiness are worth a whole lot more than her 12 dollar tilapia entree. Ignoring the energy invested in presenting your best self and opening yourself up to a new person, rejecting someone is actually a very difficult and stressful thing to do. While it\'s not necessarily the best choice, your dates might ignore your texts because it\'s a lot easier than telling you that they didn\'t enjoy your company enough to want more of it - even another piece of that coveted free tilapia. It\'s an extremely difficult thing to do, but try thinking about why these women might not have connected with you enough to accept your offer for a second date. Do you not make a great first impression? If not, why? Really think about what it would be like to go out on a date with you. Good luck!'

There are ways to diplomatically communicate your preferences to your spouse while still (genuinely, hopefully) expressing appreciation for all of their energy and effort. One approach is to be more emphatic in your praise of the dishes that you really enjoy rather than picking apart the dishes that you dislike. People tend to respond well to positive feedback and generally less well to negative feedback. Keep in mind that it\'s very rare that two people will have the same exact idea of what is "good" and what is "bad". This means that you might think her lasagna tastes like it came from an elementary school cafeteria, but it might be her childhood favorite.

It does a disservice to both the student and the institution to knowingly accept a student who will struggle and likely fail and, moreover, not go on to represent the institution well as an alumni. It's a lose - lose. If psychological testing proves to be an effective adjunct tool for assessing which prospective students will thrive and which will fail then this is a positive thing. Assessing whether or not a student has an internal or external locus of control could be valuable. For example, will the student place all of the blame for their inability to do well in a course on the professor and the students in their group or will they take personal responsibility?"

To take this to this to the sort of logical extreme that would make Spock blush, if we wanted to have no crime we absolutely could. It would just cost us a lot of money and some of our freedoms and almost all of our privacy. So of course, we are willing to tolerate some crime to avoid opening the door to Big Brother. We choose to have some level of crime. The government already has the ability to listen in to every phone call, text message, email, tweet, pin, Quora questions, and so on -- if they need more than that to prosecute, perhaps we either need better prosecutors or this is the intersection at which we find the level of "tolerable crime".A weaker point is the "criminals will always have guns" take.

If you were giving a sales pitch to potentially very important clients, but didn't appear to have tried to learn their names it might not reflect well. If someone you really looked up to or admired couldn't remember your name you might feel a little hurt - as if they didn't care about you. I think, generally speaking, people care how they are received by others and sometimes the little things like remembering names aren't so little."

S' No, you are most certainly not a "bad girl" (I shudder just typing that phrase) or anything of the sort. I grew up in a Christian home, too. Your 20\'s are a really great time when you get to start making choices and learning about what is right for you, and it doesn\'t mean that you are any less Christian if you choose to have sex. This probably seems stunningly obvious, but as you are deciding what is right for you, sexually, make sure that you stay true to what feels right both emotionally and physically. Enjoy this time when you get to discover what is right for you and who you are in this way. It\'s fun to learn about ourselves - there is absolutely nothing "bad" about it :)'

S' I did not start wearing makeup until I entered college world. Well, aside from a visit or two to the Clinique counter with my mom in high school when they slapped some strangely green-ish taupe shadow and brown liner on my lids. So, yeah, I was a little clueless (understatement). And, like you, I wanted to look nice for dates and more formal events and parties. I wanted to feel like a glamorous 20-something person when I went out at night. You have several options for bulking up your makeup prowess. 1. Makeup lesson from a professional makeup artist.  For me, this was by far the greatest help and laid a fantastic foundation of makeup mastery. While not inexpensive (a few hundred dollars, depending on your area), you will get a lot of education for your money. Depending on the artist, your lesson might include, but is not limited to: They will help you shop for the best products for you and your budget, as they are not restricted to selecting products from only one brand. You will learn how to select the best, most flattering shades for your skin tone. The artist will teach you how to play up your best features for day/night.You will learn how to properly apply primers, foundations, and blushes. The artist will delve into countering and highlighting.The artist will help you select proper tools and discuss how to clean and care for them. The artist will cover any special requests you have, such as a "10 minute face". Be prepared to take notes.2. MediaOnce you have mastered the basics in your aforementioned lesson, subscribe to Allure magazine or another magazine that focuses on beauty and makeup. This will help you keep up with color trends and new little tips and techniques. You will also discover great new products hitting the market. If you are looking for a very specific "how-to", check in with YouTube. For example, "How to Apply False Lashes". I don\'t find the more general makeup tutorials on YouTube to be super helpful. 3. Friend + SephoraDo you have a friend who always looks amazing? Consider spending a fun afternoon with her in the biggest Sephora near you. Experiment with new looks together and have a great time. While you are at the store you can ask her what products and tricks she uses. Try them on. But, remember, because everyone\'s face shape, eye shape, lip shape (and so on and so forth) are different - her products might not look the same on you. This is why it\'s a good idea to test drive them during your fun Sephora afternoon. 4. And, Finally, the Most Important Advice Get your eyebrows professionally waxed and even tinted if needed. If your eyebrows don\'t look good, your makeup will not look good. It\'s one of those cruel truths of makeup.'

S' I never imagined that I would walk down the aisle to holy matrimony with a programmer. Sure, my parents were programmers and owned a tech startup, but I thought that world just wasn\'t for me. I was filled with passion and was impulsive and had an adventurous and slightly mischievous streak a mile wide. But more importantly, I hated sci fi, role playing games, Japanese anime, and I have never seen the Star Wars movies (please, dear readers, refrain from downvoting because I have not seen Star Wars). So, either J paid eHarmony quite handsomely to fix the matches, or there was a major bug in their matching engine, because when I received my list of matches there was only one. And that one match was, of course, Mr. J. Maybe it wasn\'t a fluke after all, because he proposed only a month after our first date and I happily accepted. When you are engaged to be married, your friends and family shower you with lovely and (mostly) useful gifts. Like towels and teapots and trinkets. Hindsight is 20/20, of course, and instead of allowing J to register for that soccer ball thing that you make ice cream in, I should have registered for a primer book on, "Your Life With A Programmer; The Basics," or some such. Because I didn\'t receive such a primer, I will take this opportunity to share a few bites of programmer dating wisdom.Is that a GPS in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?If you are going to love a programmer, you need to embrace quirks and the unconventional and the plain ol\' strange and weird. Not even just embrace, but love. I learned this very early on with J. On our first date J greeted me at the restaurant with an awkward hug and I felt a large bulge in his pocket. That\'s alright, I thought... Everyone has their, um, moments? I noticed that the giant bulge remained throughout dinner and dessert. This is when I began to feel quite uncomfortable - it was a blind date, after all. I reassured myself that we were in a public place and everything would be fine. When we left the restaurant J pulled a ginormous, mount-on-your-dash-sized GPS unit out of his pocket. First I was relieved, but then I was even more weirded out. Who carries around a GPS in their pocket (this was pre-smart phone)? He explained to me that he thought it would be useful if we wanted to find a coffee shop after dinner. Okay, not weird or creepy, just pragmatic in an unusual way and well, yes, quirky. Things like this happen *a lot* when you love a programmer. When you encounter something analogous to a bulge, don\'t raise your eyebrows in horror, trust that he has thought things through and has everything under control. But I\'m supposed to be the normal one at the party! When you love a programmer you will inevitably attend parties and events that are dominated by nerds and programmers - your sweetie\'s "people". Maybe for the first time in your life, you will feel like the "weird one" at a social event. Your gorgeous hunk of programmer can then revel in the sweet, sweet, "oh, how the tables have turned" glory. You will find that it is hard for you to join in on the small talk because it isn\'t small talk at all. Rather, it\'s in-depth discussion about duck eggs and pet ducks or how to make your own cheese and incredibly, incredibly in-depth discussions about coal. As an outsider, feel free to occasionally chime in with things like "I like cheese." They might then quiz you about about your dairy intake habits. Do you love learning about duck eggs? About coal? About cheese making? About any and all obscure hobbies? Loving a programmer might be right for you.If your programmer is a snappy dresser with great style, he is an impostor.Does your man look like he stepped straight out of the pages of GQ? He might be an NSA plant or he might just have like three great "date outfits" that a friend helped him find, I don\'t know, but either way it\'s time to do some snooping. I don\'t generally endorse any sort of snooping in an intimate relationship, but if you are dating a programmer who dresses well, this is very serious. If your covert op turns up free tees he scored at Linux World and TSR tees and other free logo tees that he won at programming competitions or meetups of his favorite online games, then breathe a sigh of relief and never, ever, ever do that sneaky snooping stuff again (who told you that was okay?). He probably just bought a few special dating outfits to impress you and isn\'t with the NSA. Look, honey, all these charity event invitations!!Nope, not the gala kind where you get to wear your LBD and heels kind. When you are married to a Silicon Valley programmer, events like your second cousin\'s wedding in the Midwest can become uncomfortable charity events. It all begins when your grandma or whomever starts bragging to the table that J is like the best computer person, like, ever. I mean like rockets and spaceships and stuff (sorry, J, I think what you do is very interesting, but it\'s not rockets and spaceships). And, of course, the GOBS of money. Because everyone in SV makes LOADS of money (please note the extremely heavy sarcasm). Protip: It\'s important to master the "polite smile" so that at events like this you don\'t let the annoy seep through the polite. Everyone at the table is *very* impressed and mentions that cousin Eddy needs a website and Aunt Doris needs help with using Word and so on and so forth. Protip: It\'s important to attend weddings with open bars. OMG! This trophy is for me? But I didn\'t do anything to earn it! But I didn\'t even prepare an acceptance speech! I\'m so embarrassed! No, really, I\'m embarrassed. If you are an attractive woman married to a programmer, people will sometimes give you a trophy whether you earned it or not. Like, even if you married your programmer when he had 3k to his name and lived in a seedy apartment. Trophy. To illustrate, I was shopping for a pair of nice heels at a nice department store (which I was paying for out of our joint account, to which we both contribute) and the overly-friendly salesperson asked me, "Are you married? What does your husband do?" They asked me nothing about what I do or my life. I told them that J is a computer guy, to which they responded, "Wow! That must be so nice - the success (wink) - and you get to come and buy shoes!!!" hmmmkaaay... I wore my trophy shoes on our next date to a nice restaurant in SF (we were celebrating an anniversary). J wore a logo tee, naturally. We were showered with a ridiculously embarrassing amount of attention by the manager, the sommelier, and the waiter. I mean, at a certain point it crosses a line from "attentive" to "why don\'t you just join us at our table". So, if you love a programmer, be prepared to occasionally embrace the trophy. Match his socks correctly and he will bring you flowers. It\'s true that programmers have their little oddities. J, for example, will not wear socks unless they match exactly perfectly. He says that it makes him feel weird all day long. But, for as many little quirks as he or they may have, they have 10 times more love to give. J shows his love in all sorts of little ways. And he really listens, even when I\'m talking on and on about some random Quora answer. He knows how to make me happy when I\'m sad and how to make me laugh and why I hate surprises. Programmers are pretty awesome.'

S' Mothers are among the toughest in the lot of family and friends to choose gifts for. Likely because we desire to give our mothers something great that they will love - and that\'s absolutely no easy task. When I first start to think about a gift for my mother or a mother, I ponder a few preliminary questions: Does she need things? Does she need things for her home or for her wardrobe? Does she not need anything for her home/wardrobe/gardening? How well do I know her? How well do I know her taste? How much do I have budgeted for this gift? The answers to these questions should create some neat, nice, natural categories:Needs things/Know her well:Cashmere sweater and pretty scarfA Kindle filled with some of her favorite books plus some new authors to try.A "tv/movie night" basket - for ex, fill a movie theater popcorn tub with a Chromecast, some of her favorite movies, snacks, and two tickets to the local theater.A "breakfast in bed" basket - for ex, fill a decorative basket that she can reuse in her home with something she needs, lets say a waffle maker, and fancy waffle mixes, fun little syrups, and any other fun/fancy breakfast in bed type items.If you know that she takes yoga classes, a nice yoga outfit with a certificate for one free class tucked into the top. Take the class with her, if possible!Doesn\'t need things/Know her well:When your mother doesn\'t need another blue sweater or another pan or more towels or more whatever, it\'s nice to spend the day with her doing things that she loves. Treat your mother to a mother/daughter spa day at a great spa. Get massages and mani/pedis and then go out for a relaxing lunch and a glass of wine.If your mother is the outdoorsy sort, plan a great hike and a fabulous picnic with all of her favorite foods. Or take her kayaking or sail-boating.If your mother is into art, plan a day gallery hopping at all the best galleries. Finish the evening with dinner at her favorite place. If you live a state or two away, and it\'s feasible, surprise her and fly in for the weekend. Show up at her door with a bouquet of her favorite flowers.Needs things/Don\'t know her well (a mother-in-law, perhaps)I don\'t generally love or endorse sending a gift certificate, but this is one circumstance in which is might be your best option. Alternatively, you could scour sites like RedEnvelope for inspiration and to get your gift-giving juices flowing. Doesn\'t need things/Don\'t know her wellSend flowers.Take her out to a nice dinner or make her a nice dinner.Send a pretty piece of locally made jewelry. Send a really nice bottle of wine.Send a beautiful basket of fancy bath products (if that\'s her "thing").'

S' Ah, gossip. We love to hate it...or is it just love? A 2011 NY Times article, "The Gossip Machine, Churning Out Cash," estimates that the celeb gossip industry tops out at more than 3 billion revenue each year. Pretty shocking, right? Or is it not surprising at all? People are voyeurs. People are bored, jealous, insecure, seeking approval. People are all kinds of things. So why am I talking about celebrity gossip when you are asking about your personal life? To illustrate how insidious and deeply entrenched gossip has become in our society. As a society, we collectively upvote gossip more than 3 billion times a year. Gossip has many times more followers than D\'Angelo and Bodnick combined. Where does this leave us? We can be relatively certain that people will gossip about us throughout our lives (vicious or otherwise) and it is prudent to tailor our coping strategies accordingly.When I first learned about this thing we call gossip -- the first time I heard some nasty untruths about me floating around in the ether -- I was quite young. I felt indignant. I felt violated. I felt angry. I wanted justice - for everyone to know that those wretched things were not true and part of me wanted everyone to know who was responsible for spreading those terrible untruths. Anger bubbled and festered inside of me and the resentment that I felt stained many months of my life. Ironically, part of the way that I wanted to "fight" the gossip was by spreading even MORE gossip. After all, I didn\'t really know who started the rumors. A bit of an insanity circle.Flash forward and many years and lots of gossip have passed by between that first gossip emotional wreck/disaster and now. I\'ve heard some super curious things about myself over the years. Everything from why I didn\'t attend such and such event to accusations of things so outrageous it\'s funny to mundane everyday "front porch" gossip that\'s far from true. I don\'t get angry any more or feel indignant. I don\'t feel resentful or want to bring anyone to whatever sort of crazy justice I wanted a lifetime ago. Why? A few reasons. The main reason stems from my general lack of caring. I don\'t have enough emotional energy to spend time on things like what people are saying about me. Because the truth is that it doesn\'t really matter. And don\'t underestimate people. People are generally wise to gossip and can see through it, even if they have fun while "in the moment" sharing a juicy bit or two with their friends. So, as long as I live my life in the way that I see fit and in a way that I feel good about, people will eventually just ignore the clutter being fed to them by the hens. Here on Quora, sharp users will warn you not to engage with trolls or "not to feed the trolls." This is very analogous with gossip mongers. Consider them trolls and don\'t engage or feed them. If you have ever made this mistake you understand why. No one comes out a winner. Everybody looks bad. Everybody loses. Protip: When you do see someone who you think is gossiping about you, there is no need to be rude. A warm smile and simple hello (then move on, of course, no need to have a lunch date) will serve you much better in the long run than an icy look or cold shoulder.'

Is "S.T.E.M." a bubble that will pop like a Macy\'s parade float a la Wall Street? Will it all blow over like this newfangled interweb thing? It\'s much more likely that the U.S. will continue to ramp up their STEM efforts significantly over the next 50 years. Why? Because in spite of the fact that Silicon Valley is a booming metropolis and attracts phenomenal talent from all over the world, the United States is failing pretty miserably when it comes to math and science education. The NPR article that I have linked below details pretty nicely just how poorly students in the US are doing so I will spare you the bleak statistics.Why will the US ramp up efforts to fix the broken STEM education system? Because jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), goods-producing industries like construction, manufacturing, and mining will lose many thousands of jobs between years 2002 and 2022. During those same years, healthcare and business service industries will gain many thousands of jobs. Using healthcare as an example, think about how STEM skills directly apply to every aspect of the industry. The doctors and nurses, for starters, are a gimme. But think about the technology that allows for single-incision laparoscopic gallbladder removal. Think about robot assisted surgery. Think about your electronic medical records and even think about how those simple IV drips work. Think about how you can swallow a radioactive tracer and doctors can watch it on a screen as it works its way through your body. Think about artificial knees and hips. Think about how your scan results can be read by a doctor in a different state and you can have the results minutes later. Think about the technology that insurance companies employ. Think about how you can take a pill and your migraine headache magically disappears - poof! And these are just a few teeny tiny examples from one industry.The push for better STEM education won\'t quit until we quit demanding bridges and streets that are safe, houses that are well designed, cars that are energy efficient and park themselves, medicines that are safe and effective, leisure flights to space -- the list goes on and on....and on. It\'s actually pretty simple. A fad is fad because people get sick of being injured by their slap bracelet or looking silly at Zumba. People haven\'t shown signs yet of tiring of fast, reliable internet or better healthcare or safer bridges. The US needs kids who can do math and science. Right now, meh... So they will keep trying until they figure out the equation. U.S. Students Slide In Global Ranking On Math, Reading, Science'

S' Meeting people and making new friends is hard for most everyone. I know that it probably seems like new friendships are challenging only for us "chosen few" who were truly blessed with an introverted nature -- reserved and shy or serious at times -- but that really isn\'t the case. It\'s fairly universally tough and intimidating to put yourself out there - feeling exposed and vulnerable. The "putting yourself out there" part is similar in many ways to dating. There is nothing wrong with you, lovely girl, making new friends just isn\'t a cake walk.The good news, and there is good news, is that there are a lot of ways to branch out and meet new friends and new people! In high school many people tend to think, in a rather insular way, that all of their friends must attend their high school or be a member of this clique or that clique. This kind of thinking isn\'t "branching out" thinking, it\'s, well, ... the opposite of that. And it\'s not a great way to think when you want to broaden your horizons and expand your circle. Are all of your parent\'s friends their coworkers?? Of course not! That seems silly, right? Branching out of the walls of your high school has several perks, including the ever-coveted college app shiny star. Let\'s check it out:One great way to make friends is to volunteer doing something that you love and are passionate about. Let\'s say, for giggles, that you are passionate about animals. Volunteer at a horse rescue or an animal shelter. You will be doing something that you love, donating your time to a great cause, and meeting like-minded potential friends. Even if they don\'t become friends, you will still have a great time doing something for a great cause, AND you get that shiny star for your college app. Win-win-win. I volunteered at a blood bank when I was in high school and I loved it because the people were fantastic and I made a few friends all while doing something that I thought was important. Plus, there was a super adorable tech that I had a pretty big crush on (understatement). Protip: Leave the stuff about the adorable tech off of your college app should you desire to be admitted.You said that you are interested in music. Have you ever thought about taking group lessons? Guitar, drums, whatever it is that you are into? This is another great way to meet new people who share an interest and you will get better at something that you can pursue your entire life while you\'re at it. Alternatively, if you belong to a church, perhaps think about joining the choir or ask if they need someone who plays the instrument you play. While we are on the subject, if you do belong to a church, consider participating in youth group activities. You say that you like reading and learning. Is there a book club in your area that you could join? This is a great way to have fun, meet new people, and learn something too. I really encourage you to look into this. Even if many of the members of the book club are older than you are -- you might find a "mentor" which is really important. Mentors are important as you are thinking about colleges and careers. Also consider attending readings at local bookstores by famous authors. You should be able to find a calendar of events online. If you would like to meet more people at your school, consider trying out for a play! I have given you just a few ideas. There are, of course, far too many for me to list here without boring you. It\'s absolutely wonderful to have a wide variety of friends as you travel through life and change and grow. Good luck to you! '

S" It is great to have a real passion for something. Whether it is a passion for a career or a hobby or a weekend job, many people never find a true passion or something that they just love to do. Something that makes them feel incredible. So consider yourself lucky. I suspect that you and your dad share more common ground here than you might think. Your end goal is to be financially independent and rockin' your own career, yes? You might be surprised to discover that this is your father's hope for you as well. Being a strong, powerful, independent woman is important for many reasons - not just because your father doesn't want to support you for the rest of your life. When you are doin' it on your own you have options and choices. The world is your oyster. You get to decide. You get to decide where you want to live, who you want to date, if you want to get married, if you don't want to get married, if you want to have kids, if you want to travel the world -- I could go on, but you get the point. Independence makes your world bigger and gives you more choices. Your dad probably wants this for you - he wants the whole BIG world for you.Start by doing your homework. Interview makeup artists. Talk to them about how they got started, where they went to school, how long it took them to get their ideal job. Talk to them about how much beginning makeup artists make. Talk to them about how hard it is to get a job in your area. Talk to more than one. Talk to as many as you possibly can. If you find out, through your interviews, that a beginning makeup artist makes 15k a year, do the math. If rent is $800/mo, your cell bill is xx/mo, car insurance is xx...gas, school loan repayment, car payment, food, dinners out, work clothes, laundry money, health insurance, etc. Work through a realistic budget. Is this doable for you? Are you willing to live this way to pursue your dream? OR should you consider:Compromising with your father. Go to university. Let him help pay the tuition and your expenses. Perhaps choose to pursue a degree in business with a focus on sales and marketing, which you can later leverage to help your own makeup business. During your summers off from university you can pursue makeup certifications and work as a makeup artist. After graduation, why not try working a 9-5 corporate job to build up some savings and business experience, and do makeup for weddings or somesuch on weekends? Eventually you might build up a big enough clientele/reputation that you can switch to makeup only. You can both pursue your passion and earn a degree. Dads are actually pretty handy, believe it or not."

S" First, a product is never finished, so get that idea right out of your head. What I see here is a lightweight MVP at best. When that is complete you'll need to start building the real product. There is a lot of hidden complexities not obvious in these mocks. For instance I see an RSS feed button. And there is some sort of notification thing going on. I didn't see UI for how that works. What triggers that, how are they viewed, how are they dismissed? Profiles?This is probably a minimum three month job for the front end. Rushed. Probably closer to six if you care about the code. And if you think you'll get a guy to do both front and backends, more than likely one set of skills will suffer, because either domain is large enough. And since you have a largely complete backend, that's also going to limit possible candidates. If you do find a single engineer that is equally proficient on both front and backends, that backend better be in the same technologies he's good with. The most likely scenario here is that you will find an engineer who is good with the backend technologies and thinks he can muddle through the frontend well enough. Don't do it. Frontend tech is hard. It is way too easy to get a tangled mess when a backend engineer tries to jump in and do it with little to no experience. Of course it goes the other way as well. Frontend engineers don't usually understand the complexities of building a scalable backend. So, you should get dedicated frontend and backend engineers. Of course, if you don't really care about the long term viability of the code, all this goes out the window.

For instance, if you're working on any sort of enterprise system that has been around for any length of time, and you're not doing any frontend work, you may end up having to use Java.You really can't pick one language and hope it fits all niches and opportunities. If you're looking for a language to sink your teeth into and start learning, then I've heard Python is good. I'm just not sure how far it will take you professionally. JavaScript is pretty easy to learn, but it is also easy to pick up bad habits.If you're looking to take advantage of current opportunities, then we're back to JavaScript which is really hot right now. So, the end result? It really depends on your goals. If you just want to learn, maybe stick with Python. If you want to do cool stuff, or work on the web, or take advantage of current market trends, then JavaScript may be the way to go.Just don't do PHP. Starting your career with PHP is like starting to smoke when you're in your 20's."

And halfway through the job, one out of the two trucks the company owned broke down, so, the route became twice as long. I was always dirty, and came home smelling horrible.I loved that job. I got a lot of fresh air, I built up a lot of muscle, and I liked the people I worked with. However, I did discover something about myself: I didn't want to be a garbage man my whole life. And fortunately while I was loading some trash one day, I found some books that gave all sorts of good information about the Atari 8 bit computers, which is a computer system I was already familiar with. So that gave me the boost I needed to head back to school.But the question is about bad jobs. In my mind, these are jobs where you are ineffectual, and you cannot grow. I grew a lot in that first job, both physically, and motivationally. As software engineer amongst the many excellent jobs I've been fortunate to have, I've had a handful of jobs that felt stagnating. Sometimes, I was simply not interested in the domain, sometimes because my input was not valued, and sometimes, the energy of the company was utterly flat.This was the case in my last bad job. I took it because it seemed promising. It was in the field of genetics, which I've always found fascinating, and there were lots of Ph.D.s on staff, so lots of opportunities to learn. On paper, it was awesome. However, there was simply no energy there.I've been working in and around games for a long time. The crowd tends towards younger and energetic. I actually do well in open floor plans where I have direct contact with my peers and we can collaborate on things when necessary. One thing an open floor plan has is energy.This company was older. Lots older. I'm pushing fifty, and I was was of the younger folks there. The energy was utterly flat. I worked in a cube, with barely any contact with other members of the team. They also didn't seem to understand web based technologies, and I was unable to have any influence in this. The design was horrible, and I couldn't change it.So when an old boss called me up a few moths later and told me he was going to try to poach me, I nearly dropped to the ground to thank god, and I'm an atheist.That job was so bad, it doesn't make it on to my resume.So, lets contrast it with my first job. The first job had lots of energy, it pushed me to become better, and I enjoyed the people worked with. Totally different from this newer job. I was board, uninspired and had barely any interaction with my peers. That's the difference between a good and a bad job."

But assuming they do, I'm going to disagree with some others.I think like life elsewhere would be recognizable.

A shark (a cartilagenous fish), a dolphin (a mammal), and an Ichthyosaur (a marine reptile).The details of these are significantly different, but superficially they have arrived at very similar body plans.I think that there are naturally certain niches that will arise, and that there are certain body plans that will be efficient in these niches, and are likely to be hit on, even in a world where life has developed very differently from our own."

The coloration of the peppered moth before the industrial revolution was light, to better match the background color of the trees that they rested on.However, the trees became darkened with soot during the Industrial revolution, which favored moths with a darker coloration.And now that pollution isn't the large problem it once was, the moths are tending towards a light er colorization again.The peppered moth is pretty much the poster kid of natural selection, since the changes in coloration have been so well documented over the past couple of hundred years.To quote the Wikipedia entry above:The first carbonaria morph was recorded by Edleston in Manchester in 1848, and over the subsequent years it increased in frequency. Predation experiments, particularly by Bernard Kettlewell, established that the agent of selection was birds who preyed on the carbonaria morph."

For instance, a change in weather to a more snowy landscape would put pressure on coat coloring to favor lighter shades. Of course selective pressure can be less obvious, like the pressure the immune system is always under to adapt to new diseases.In general it appears that most variation in a population is more or less random, with genetic drift playing a pretty strong role.

S" Morphologically, H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis are very distinct:This is because neanderthals and modern humans split off from a common ancestor about 500,000 years ago. That gives time for a lot of divergence.Culturally, neanderthals and humans were likely very different. For instance, their hunting styles. Based on common injuries found in neanderthal fossils, they found that these were consistent with close-quarters fighting. There is no evidence that they used projectile weapons like early H. sapiens did.Also, in terms of tools and ornamentation, H. sapiens had a far more advanced culture.That said, once you cover a neanderthal with muscle and skin, they look close enough to a humans, despite possible cognitive differences, that given human sexual proclivities, sexual interactions would not be unexpected. However, based on the DNA evidence, it looks like this interaction was not necessarily common, or failed to produce viable offspring. This could be due to difficulty in successful fertilization because of genomic divergence, or because the two cultures rarely interacted.As far as being the same species, as others have noted, species are a human construct, and nature doesn't really care about our convenience. Species borders can be fuzzy, and gene flow between populations can still happen sporadically leading to occasional hybridization before divergence makes this impossible.For an example of fuzzy species borders, we can look to Ring Species. A ring species is a gradient of populations which can interbreed with their neighbors, but the furthest ends cannot produce fertile offspring. If the two ends of this series of populations meet, for instance the gradient wrapping around a geological feature, such as a mountain range, they appear to be two different species. For example the Ensatina salamanders of the american pacific coast:In this case, the species migrated from north to south, with different populations branching around the central valley. When they meet on the other side, the divergence in populations gives us two different species.So, were neanderthals a separate species? Well, based on anatomy, they are different enough that they are classed that way. And the gene flow between the different populations appears to be minimal. But because species is such a fuzzy concept, it doesn't really matter. The labels are convenient."

The V8 engine does a pretty good job with its JIT compilation, but there is only so much you can do with the dynamic nature of JavaScript. You can't even count on a single object instance being the same size, with the same members with the same type.

S' This is my original flippant answerBecause these severe flaws are imaginary. Evolution is taught because it is the cornerstone of modern biology, and to leave it out of education would be near criminal. Why do you hate children?I\'m going to make this much richer, since the details were added.By flaws I mean things like irreducible complexityThe problem with irreducible complexity is that it assumes a certain model of evolution, while ignoring other paths. IC assumes that evolution happens by the incremental addition of parts. It makes no allowances for other mechanisms such as Exaptation. This is the process where a trait originally evolved with one function, is coopted to be used in an entirely different way. Quoting from the above Wikipedia entry:There are many examples of exaptations. A classic example is how feathers, which initially evolved for heat regulation, were co-opted for display, and later co-opted for use in bird flight.In fact, one of Behe\'s iconic examples of this, the moustrap, has been shown to be reducible. A reducibly complex mousetrapthe circular reasoning of the concept of Survival of the Fittest (the fittest are those who survive and those who survive are deemed the fittest. This is a conclusion based on an assumption, in turn used to prove the original assumption.)This is an understandable mistake, even Karl Popper himself made it. But to quote him on this subject from: What Did Karl Popper Really Say About Evolution?I mention this problem because I too belong among the culprits. Influenced by what these authorities say, I have in the past described the theory as "almost tautological," and I have tried to explain how the theory of natural selection could be untestable (as is a tautology) and yet of great scientific interest.He then goes on:I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation. . . .The theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological. In this case it is not only testable, but it turns out to be not strictly universally true. To be more specific, when examining if a gene is under selective pressure, the hypothesis of natural selection can be compared to Neutral Theory: The Null Hypothesis of Molecular Evolution. Natural selection of genes is not tautological, it can actually be tested without assuming itself. the violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics- described as axiomatic to evolutionary thinking.This is a less forgivable misunderstanding, as it simply represents sloppy thinking. Thermodynamics doesn\'t claim that things go from ordered to messy. It essentially says that no process can gain more energy than is put into it. There are no mechanisms of evolution that propose such a thing. In fact, the mechanisms of evolution are essentially reproduction. I think you would agree that having a baby does not violate the second law. The complete lack of fossil records (supposedly ape to human fossils are proof. These have all been debunked. I\'m not sure where you got this debunked idea, but you\'re simply wrong. I also suspect you are seriously underestimating the number of fossil hominids there are. You also appear to not understand that evolution is not linear, it is bushy. Here is an example of a possible cladogram of humans most recent ancestors: Not exactly linear. And that is not a complete catalog of fossil species and many of these have multiple fossil instances.With that said, many clear trends can be found when looking at our ancestry. For example this image:29+ Evidences for MacroevolutionThis image doesn\'t represent a linear evolution, but it does show the development of derived human like features from something more basal.But here\'s something else to think about- where are the fossils that show what a pig evolved from, or a bear, what about a dolphin- an air breathing mammal that lives in the water, how did this evolve over millions of years, one gene mutation at a time, and from what? What about the apes we supposedly came from? Bears and dogs are pretty closely related. In fact, close to the base of their family tree there is a species called, wait for it, Bear dog.The Evolution of cetaceans, like dolphins, actually has a pretty good record. Perhaps most interesting is Ambulocetus natans. This is an early cetacean that was well adapted for life both in and out of the water.Why are no fossils found for the failed mutations of the animals we now see today? Because there would not be very many of those around. Fossilization is a pretty rare occurrence. Not to mention that "failure" doesn\'t fossilize well. The staggering amount of assertions by supposed experts they simply dream up to explain things without evidence, or being questioned? Evolution is one of the best theories science has going. It explains a wide diversity of otherwise seemingly unrelated data, and it makes specific, risky, testable predictions that never fail to confirm under a growing mountain of evidence. Scientists so roundly accept it because it appears to be true. What do you think makes more sense, that all these experts with decades of education and research experience are wrong and you are right. Or that they may know somethings that you do not?These severe flaws. Why are these blindly skimmed over or simply omitted altogether?Because, these flaws are nonexistent. They are the product of religious leaders who have a vested, emotional interest in this particular science being wrong.I\'m not attempting to troll here, I\'m legitimately asking why this has been so widely taught despite very obvious and serious problems behind the smoke and mirrors. Am I missing something or is the educational system really that poor?I\'m glad you are not trolling. The problem is not with education and evolution, the problem is with your understanding. But that problem can be fixed.'

S" The easy answer is: Because they need them. Arm action in sprinting is often described as 'hammering nails in a wall behind you'. The faster your arms are moving, the faster your legs will go. While downswings are somewhat conscious, upswings happen automatically because of the collective stretch reflexes of your shoulders, your chest and your arms. Think of doing hundreds of high speed reps in that fashion, and you can see how your upper body would get a good bit of training.However, sprinters do train their upper bodies, within reason. The legs and core, as Aaron rightly noted, are the prime targets of training, but a sprinter without a powerful upper body can't make it to elite status. Period.Plus, size is just one variable when it comes to strength. A variety of builds can be found in sprinting, even in the 100m. In every Olympic sprints discipline (100m, 200m, 400m), coaches generally divide their sprinters in two types. One that is 'moving up' and one that is 'going down' in distance, sometimes also know as speed vs endurance type or as power vs strength type respectively. For example, the 100m sprinter comes in the 60m type, and the 200m type. Generally, the sprinter 'moving up' tends to be shorter, and more muscular, while the others are leaner, even lanky, in comparison. There are also sprinters who can't easily be classified as either/or.Both types use their upper bodies a lot, but generally speaking, the power type sprinters uses their arms aggressively in the initial phase to accelerate, whilst the strength sprinter uses their arms to maintain form at the end of a race, and stave off deceleration. While power sprinters look 'intimidating' when sprinting, strength sprinters are often said to look 'graceful' when plying their trade.For example:Ben Johnson, former 60m and 100m sprinter, has tree trunks for legs and basketballs for shoulders. Sure, he had some 'chemical help' but even without it, he was a power sprinter. He was known to regularly blast his blocks back.At 5:09, you can see Ben's start in actionhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Compare him to his rival:Carl Lewis was a 100m &200m sprinter, and a long jumper. While by no means out of shape or even skinny in the classic sense, he's much smaller than Ben, while being a taller individual. For Carl, it meant that in any race between him and Ben, Ben would invariably start better and be ahead at the 30m mark. Carl's strength was the ability to decelerate less than his rival at the end of the race. Here's an apples-to-apples comparison, where the two raced against each other.Ben Johnson is in lane 2 (second from the inside) and Carl Lewis is in lane 4.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Note how Ben Johnson started much more powerfully, with a charateristic leap, as opposed to Carl Lewis, who is the stronger finisher. There's a slow-mo at the end where you can see this even more easily. Speaking of graceful sprinting:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Both sprinters have upper bodies according to their body type. Ben, being a power sprinter, had a well built upper body that helped him start and accelerate aggressively, while Carl had a light but strong upper body that helped him maintain form at the end of a race and decrease his deceleration.Finally, powerful full range of motion arm movements increase stride length by increasing the distance travelled in the air while not decreasing stride rateTo sum it up, sprinters have well-built upper bodies because 1. Sprinting requires aggressive, powerful, and at the same time, controlled arm action to make their legs turn over faster.2. They help to put more force into the ground, thus allowing further and higher travel during a single stride.3. The upswing of the arms increases stride length by increasing the distance travelled in the air, which leads to a net gain because the air time doesn't change."

S" For strong ankles, you need to focuse on a couple aspects.Mobility/FlexibilityStretch your calves and shin muscles between training sessions, and do dynamic stretches for the calves before your sprint workout. The dynamic stretches not only increase your range of motion instantly (although impermanently), they also improve their reflexive response, which you're looking for when sprinting.Also, foam roll your calves and the soles of your feet. You can use a tennis ball for both.Dorsiflexion/PlantarflexionMany coaches confuse their sprinters by cueing them to 'dorsiflex the foot', which means decrease the angle between the foot and the shin. Actually, the foot is held slightly plantarflexed (foot/shin angle increased to a little bit above 90 when you are in full stride), and the toes are pulled up. That creates stability in the ankle, but also triggers the stretch reflex you need, as well as fast heel recovery. Keep in mind that a lot of things happen in that very short amount of time your foot is planted on the ground and your glutes and hamstrings are exherting forces. During ground contact, you pull with your glutes and hamstrings, you stabilize with your quads, and you push off with your calves.* This is true in all phases of the sprint, from start to finish. The difference is in shin angles, point of contact upon touch down (toes or ball of foot), and heel recovery.*To clarify, if done right, none of these actions is exactly conscious. You're aware it's happening, but it should happen on its own. That said, you might have to practice this a little before it becomes automatic. Sometimes, the right cue can fix the problem instantly.Strengthening AnklesThis is where the rubber meets the road. Or should I say the spike plate meets the track? har harThe most important exercise sprinters can do to strengthen the muscles, tendons, and ligaments in the ankles and the feet (trust me, that small tissue in your soles is crucial for sprinting) is rope skipping. Barefoot, preferably on grass, even better is sand. Do 200 reps, rest a minute, do another 200, for maybe five sets total. Remember to stay on the balls of your feet, don't bend your knees in the air, or on the ground, and leave the ground as quicky as possible. Switch to doing these on one leg, after some time, and also do lots of double unders (swinging the rope through twice within one jump). When doing double unders, again, leave the ground quickly, and don't bend your knees.Good luck."

S' This is tricky to answer JUST in the context of height. Obviously, if there was a growth of 3 inches, you\'re not fully mature yet, and so not just your height, but many other variables must have changed too. Your physical strength will have increased, assuming normal development. So will the conduction speed of your nervous system, your coordination, as well the \'springiness\' of your muscles. Naturally, more leg length helps increase stride length. This all bodes well for you.The one possible caveat I see is in the start and the acceleration. Even though your overall strength surely increased, it is possible that you lost relative strength (i.e. strength output in relationship to your bodyweight). This can negatively affect your start and your acceleration phase, which can make it harder for you to reach your top speed without expending too much effort and energy. However, the above mentioned factors should more than balance this out. Here\'s your data:100m time: 12.6 secondsAverage speed: 7.93m/sA reasonable estimate of your max speed would be around 9.2m/s. Most likely, it was slightly higher.Junior athletes tend to reach max velocity at around 30m, and you might have held that for about 20m. That would give you a time of 2.17 seconds over your 30-50m segment. We assume that both 10m segements contained therein were run at the same speed, so 1.085 seconds each.If we allow for a max velocity/acceleration differential of 1.5 seconds (typical for junior athletes), that means you run a 20m from standing in 3.67 (2.17 + 1.5) seconds. Generally, about two thirds of that time falls on the first 10m, and the other third accordingly on the second 10m. So the 3.67 is split into 2.44 for 0-10m, and 1.23 for 10m-20m, giving you an average speed of 4.1m/s and 8.2m/s respectively. We estimated about 9.2m/s as your max velocity, so the 20-30m segment was likely around 8.9 m/s (about 4% below your max), so the 20-30m split was run in 1.14 seconds.Now, for your 50m time, we have calculated a total of 3.67+1.14+2.17 = 6.98Assuming that you slowed down about 5% from your max velocity over the next 50m, that gives us 1.085s*1.05*5= 5.69s for the last 50m. If we add that up, we get 6.98+5.69, we get 12.67s, i.e. very close to what you actually ran (error less than 1%). Having grown taller, your gains will come primarily in the phase past 30m, so both your maximum velocity (30-50m) as well as the entire 50-100m segment will have benefitted. Most likely, with the natural increase in strength that you surely experienced, your first 30m will have improved somewhat as well. But, how much, is the question. Your stride rate during the race would have been about 4.4 per second, assuming you took strides that were \'natural\' for you. That equates to 55.4 steps over the 100m, so an average step length of 1.80m. By the way, if we add 16% to this and multiply that by 4.4 steps per second again, we get your max velocity at 9.2m/s. The 16% is about the difference between average stride length and maximum stride length seen in 100m sprinters. Your height was 5\'5", i.e. 1.65m. That would give you an average leg length of 0.825m, although yours were probably a little longer. That gives us an average stride to leg length ratio of 1.8/.825=2.18Now that you\'re 5\'8", so 1.73m, your legs are .865m long.Applying the same ratio, your average stride length ratio is .865*2.2= 1.9mWith the same stride frequency, we get 1.9m/step*4.4 steps/s= 8.36m/sAt an average pace of 8.36m/s, your 100m time comes out to be 11.96 seconds. The difference will manifest itself more in the max velocity phase (30-50m) and then speed maintenance (50-100m). Your acceleration should be the same, or have improved very slightly. There\'s also a small chance that it might have become a little bit worse, particularly the first 10m.The 30-50m segment should take you 2.08s, (9.61m/s) and your 50-100m segment will be around 5.46 seconds.There are many assumptions in this answer, based on experience, measurements, and formulae that coaches employ. Not all of them are necessarily 100% correct, but the errors likely balance each other out, so the overall result should be correct within about a tenth of a second, provided you perform to your best.To further improve your time, you should focus most on increasing your general fitness with exercise circuits. This will go a long way in staving off the slowdown that comes after the 50m. Also focus on improving your strength, as your acceleration will benefit, leading to higher maximum velocity.Thanks for the A2A.'

S" Correlating mile times and 400m times is difficult, although not impossible. The requirements of these two races are different, and thus being good at one doesn't necessarily mean you are good at the other, even if there may be some carry-over from the grit and speed you develop in either of the races.Generally, the shorter races are better predictors for performance in longer races rather than the opposite, but the further apart two races are in distance, the weaker the correlation becomes, no matter in which direction we're calculating. Otherwise, top sprinters would be able to become top marathoners too. There is a so called '5 seconds per lap' rule. That means every time you double the number of laps around the 400m track, you add 5 seconds to the time it takes you to run one lap within that race. Conversely, when you're going down in distance, you subtract 5 seconds.For a mile run (1'600m) your time was 5:55 minutes, i.e. 355 seconds.Because the mile is slightly longer than the 1'600m, we will subtract 3 seconds from that time to get an estimated 352 seconds (5:52 minutes) for the 1'600m. Divide that by four and we get 88 seconds per lap. Subtract 5, and your average lap time for the 800m is about 83 seconds. That amounts to a 166 seconds, i.e. 2:46 minutes 800m race. Finally, for the 400m, we would take 83 seconds per lap, subtract 5 again, and we get 78 seconds (1:18) for an open 400m race. Keep in mind, however, that many factors come together in each race, and they are run very differently. The method of building champion mile runners is vastly different from building champion 400m sprinters. Thus, your actual times may vary."

Maybe that's a good thing, if it's muscle mass in the legs.If there is a roughly 12 months period in between, I think there's a good chance you actually gained .5 seconds of time, assuming nothing (your health or diet) is coming in the way. If you have been training properly since then, then you'll likely blow the 12 second mark away."

I would estimate that, if you ran with the right race plan, you'd probably go 25.7, give or take .2 seconds, so the other answerers are about right with around 26 seconds.On a side note, most coaches like to use the personal best of an athlete, although using a season's best is likely more appropriate.

The heart neither lengthens while contracting against a load (like when you're lowering into a squat), nor does it fatigue until there are actually too few nutrients in the bloodstream to sustain contraction (which means you're pretty close to dying).If your upper pectoral area was hurting, it's either coming from your pecs, from another muscle, or from a different structure entirely.

S" It's funny how we can differentiate the sometimes subtle nuances between two dogs of the same breed, but can't see the individuality of a group of men over 500'000'000 strong. That's the population of the US, Canada, and Russia combined, with a little extra to spare.That isn't to say there isn't a certain amount of truth in the answer, but there's more to it than meets the eye, and many of the factors in play are not in control of the Indian men who are influenced by them. I'll address each point one by one.Lack of SophisticationWhen you talk about a lack of any sort, it's in relation to a standard or an average. I don't find many men at my age having much in the way of sophistication. Much of this has to do with lack of education, both academical and social. Makes sense in a poor country, even though it is a sad state of affairs.Complete Self-SatisfactionIf Indian men thought they were perfect, they wouldn't be buying fairness creams, trying to find out ways to increase their height, increasingly hitting the gym, and changing the way they eat. Complete Lack of GroomingDamn near non-sensical. Using large amounts of oil to style your hair is necessary. Have you seen the amounts gel people use? Even then, the statement here is way over the top. As for flossing, that is a concept all of India is yet to catch on to. Give it time.Complete Lack of PhysiqueThe whole paragraph sounds nonsensical. We just need to look at the Sikh comunity, as one prominent example. Some of it is poverty and inadequate diet too.Complete Lack of anything interestingBy their 30s, most Indian men are married and have children. Guess what? Having hobbies under those circumstances is hard. As for when we're younger? Have you tried being an Indian teen with a hobby? Our parents are extremely academically minded. If you as much as show interest in a subject matter, quite often, you're whipped back in line. Cultivating a hobby is something that requires an at least neutral environment. Ours is often a hostile one, in this regard. The rest of that paragraph is overly sarcastic bullshit, and even racist, or at least colorist. Being dark is not a shame, nor bad, nor wrong, nor in any way inferior to being light-skinned. Now, I'm not saying that Indian men aren't at least in part responsible for who they are and how they act. But understand that the system in place encourages certain personality traits and suppresses others. It's our job to dismantle that societal machine and allow for better self-realization of all Indians. It's not going to be easy."

I don't know what I would do in his position, but I do know that it would not be an easy matter. Even if I don't fancy her, rejecting somebody causes pain, and most humans are not into that.You are right in mentioning the race dynamic, as it isn't completely irrelevant. Many Indian men have held and still hold a fascination for White women, sometimes even to the degree of pathological fetishization. Conversely, white women are also often considered capricious, moody, disloyal, and unreliable. **This isn't to say that this particular gentleman holds these views, but they may color his understanding, ideas, and thought processes without him even knowing.

S" The origin of a muscle is the point on a bone where it is said to 'start' as a rule, the origin tends to be higher up, or closer to the midline than the insertion. For the 'normal' action of a muscle, the origin remains immobile.The insertion is where the muscle attaches to another bone further down, or further from the midline. This is the bone the muscle 'acts' on. The action, finally, is what the muscle does. For example, the pectoralis major muscle adducts the arm (among many other things). A single muscle can have multiple actions, often determined by which direction the activated muscle fibers are running in.Last but not least, depending on what parts of the skeleton are being stabilized, the muscle can use its insertion as an origin and act on the origin as if it was an insertion."

S" Yes, absolutely.There's nothing wrong with a White author writing about Black characters. Your specific example is further made easier because your Black characters live on a continent where there are no White people, so there are fewer of those power structure issues that might plague e.g. a White American author writing about a Black American. Even then, White people writing Black characters isn't wrong or bad per se. A problem may arise if White authors are the only ones doing so, or making the character stereotypical or offensive, obviously. The flipside is that some White authors (and movie script writers) avoid Black characters as much as possible, allowing at most one thrown in there for diversity, without any true meaning to the story or depth. I'll take a well-attempted but somewhat flawed Black character over a complete omission any time. It's important for authors to research the history, culture, values, and views of the people they're writing about, but at the same time also allow for individuality and diversity within communities. Your case, again, is special, given that you've created a fictional Universe. You have much more creative freedom with how you depict various groups.Thanks for the A2A, Chrys."

S' When I hear or read the word Pakistan, a flurry of words race through my mind. "Friends", "family", "sadness", "separation", "unity". My view of Pakistan, given that I\'ve never been there, is colored by the Pakistani people I have had the privilege to know growing up and living in Switzerland. It\'s based on some Bollywood movies -more so than others- and it is largely influenced by my understanding of Indians. Last but not least, stories of other people who have gone to Pakistan or who live there. South Asia, and the Indian subcontinent in particular, is much more volatile than many people and media outlets would have you believe. As such, the region can only progress when the various countries within put aside their, generally minor, differences, sit around the table, and finally start addressing problems and solutions together. I know the above is somewhat idealistic, although there are increasing efforts of cooperation, which is a good sign.And so, in conclusion, I have the same things to say to the great nation of Pakistan what I would say to any nation, really:Know yourself, acknowledge every part of yourself, accept what is beneficial or irrelevant, and fight tooth and nail the things that keep you from advancing towards a better, brighter, more egalitarian and fairer future. Know your friends, and make more of them. Allies slumber in likely and unlikely places, reach out to them.

S" If a single pull-up is all you need to do, and you can get your arms to just below ninety degrees, I recommend observing the following steps to nail your pull-up in time.Back Warm UpOne of the smartest ways to warm up of for a pull-up is to do a couple dozen jumping jacks, and then push your outstretched arms back, thumbs pointing backwards. Hold that position for a slow count of ten. Feel those upper back muscles working and maybe even burning a little.Chin-UpsChin-ups are almost the same move as pull-up, but they tend to be slightly easier for most people, as they involve the biceps a lot more. Instead of grabbing the bar with your palms facing away from you, have the palms facing you when holding the bar. Try pulling up from this position, you'll find that you can reach the bar with your chest. Grease the Groove/Consolidation TrainingAfter achieving your first chin-up, take a moment every day, in the morning, the afternoon, and the evening to do the warm up I described and attempting one chin-up at a time, with ample rest in between. Try a total of 4 per session. After that, do pull-up negatives. Get the bar beneath your collar by jumping or using a chair to stand on, and hold it with your palms facing away from you. Then try to slow your descent as much as possible. Again, shoot for about 4 of these negatives per session.Putting it togetherYou will find that within 2-3 days, you'll be able to do two chin-ups consecutively, and once you can confidently repeat the feat within a few minutes, which will probably take another 2-3 days, you will have the prerequisite strength to do one full, chest to bar pull-up. All the best.Thanks for the A2A, Drew Blackwell."

S" The handstand push-up is generally best learnt practicing the two components in its name separately. Handstands and push-ups. Start with push-ups.If you can't do 2 sets of 20 chest-to-the-ground, perfect form, slow push-ups, don't even worry about the handstand version. Pay your dues with the basics before you think about an advanced move.Once you're confident with the push-up, work up to the same numbers with your feet on a knee-high object. For the next step, find an object that's just below hip height, and place your feet on it for push-ups. You should aim for 2 sets of 15 reps at minimum.Finally, place your feet on an object that's above hip height, and train to do 2x15 push-ups in that position.This phase of training will strengthen your shoulders, upper chest, upper trapezius, and triceps, as well as your core in preparation for the harder variations to come. It will also build the strength necessary for you to hold yourself in a handstand position.Pike Push-UpsPikes are a great exercise to progress to handstand push-ups. You're pushing at almost the same angle, teaching your body the biomechanics of the handstand push-up, but with far less weight. Simple get up on your toes, and bend at the hips without rounding your back. You'll look like a jackknife from the side. Now do push-ups in that position. The bottom of a rep has your head lightly touch the floor. Keep your hands slightly wider than shoulder width, and keep your elbows from flaring out. Build the strength and endurance to do 2 sets of 15 reps before moving on the next step.Over time, work on elevating your feet with the pike push-up too. The highest you should raise your feet is the length of your upper body, measured from the waist to the top of your head. Keep the 90 bend at all times.HandstandsNow we come to learning the handstand against a wall. My favorite way to do it is getting into a push-up position with my hands about half a foot from the wall, and then kicking up with my feet. Practice staying in this position for at least a minute straight, but build up to it over time. As a safety measure, practice this with a folded towel on the ground below the spot your head is, just in case your arms give out on you. It's unlikely to happen if you followed the instructions above, however.Adding the push-up back inSo you've got your body into shape. Your shoulders, upper chest, triceps, core, back and all other muscles are ready for what lies ahead of them. Get in front of a wall, and kick up. Slowly descend, until your arms are slightly bent. Pause for a moment, then push back up. That's a half handstand push-up. Don't forget to place a towel beneath your head!Repeat the half handstand push-up, until you think you've got one or two reps more left. Stop the set there. Repeat again after about 2 minutes.After two sets of half handstand push-ups, practice handstand push-up negatives. Start at the top, and lower yourself as slowly as you can. This is where towel comes in handy. When you reach the bottom, kick back up into a handstand, and repeat. Do 2 sets of as many reps as you can safely do, so 1-2 reps shy of failure. Over time, you will build enough strength to do a full handstand push-up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...My form isn't perfect yet, but I'm getting there.Thanks for the A2A, Thomas Duggan."

Seriously, DON\'T LET THEM PUSH YOU AROUND.""Are you sure I should do tha-" "YES, I am bloody sure. Do you want to learn something or not?""Okay, sorry."I calm down again. "The same thing goes for Mom and Dad. Don\'t let them push you around. Tell Dad to get his stuff himself. Be firm, even mean, if need be. And don\'t let him cut your hair. EVER. And if he discounts your opinion, tell him straight up what you think of that. There\'s no point in keeping your anger down and letting him dismiss you whenever it suits him. Ask for what\'s yours, and don\'t budge on it until you\'ve gotten what you want. You know what I am talking about, right? The thing that started with the cupboard Dad broke.""Oh, right!""And most of the generic good advice holds true. Stay away from drinking, smoking and drugs. I\'ve never did any of these, and I am better off for it.""Sure, but I wasn\'t going to try that anyway.""And one more thing about Mom and Dad. Work on having them let you sleep in on the weekends. It will prevent a lot of problems.""Okay. What about, you know, girls?"I smirk."I won\'t tell you whom to stay away from. Here\'s my advice. Don\'t go for the looks. You\'re not in love until you know the person. Most of the ones you\'ve considered are horrible ideas.""Now something completely different. You\'re pretty awesome on the inside. Let that shine through more. You\'re better off being yourself and unhappy about it than not being yourself and unhappy about it anyway. Dig?""Okay.""You\'ll meet lots of great people all over the world. Keep an open mind about who\'s bad and who\'s good, do you understand? Don\'t let people\'s prejudices influence what you think of others.""I am not sure I understand.""Don\'t worry, it will make sense in time.""Alright, I see.""Finally, before I go, here\'s my last bit of advice. Exercise. It won\'t stunt your growth, I promise. It might even help you grow taller.""Really?""Yep, really.""Okay. You\'ve given me lots of tips. I hope I can see this through.""I am sure you can. You are me, after all, and you\'re capable of things you never even thought of. Literally! All the best."And with that, I open my eyes.

If we consider improvements induced by exercise to be climbing up the steps towards your goal, a plateau is a phase where you're not advancing. For some reason, the adaptation and improvement you seek from the exercise, diet, and rest you're following is not coming.At such points, you must pause, and reconsider what you're doing. Maybe, it's time to take a week off of exercising, or exercising your chest in particular. Maybe, you need to eat more to grow.

S" The kip-up is arguably the ultimate spinal and hip agility move. Don't let that fool you, however, it requires the entire body. There must be no weak links.You will need:1. MobilityYour spine, hips, abdminal muscles, wrists, shoulders, knees and ankles need to have their full range of motion. If not, injuries are bound to occur.2. StabilitySimilary, your core should be stable and withstand the forces you are inevitably going to exert and the impacts you will experience.3. StrengthYour back, gluteal, shoulder and arm muscles will have to produce lots of force. They will also have to do this in a very short time, so of course 4. Speed will be of the essence too.Prep ExercisesBefore you start practicing for a kip-up, there are some moves you should nail as prerequisites to do a kip-up. Lying Leg RaisesTo make the most of your reflexes, you need to roll up fast. That requires decent abdominal strength and hamstring flexibility. Lying leg raises will get you there, for both aspects. Work up to 3x20 leg raises.BridgesBridges work almost the entire back of your body. They also stretch out your front abdominal muscles. A good kip-up requires precisely the kind of mobility and strength in the specific muscles that bridges build for you. Distribute the curve along the entire back, don't just focus it on the lumbar spine. Around 2x15 bridges should suffice.Pike Push-Ups/Handstand Push-UpsThe kip-up requires you to push your entire body upwards, so you want to build the strength in your shoulders and arms to do that safely, confidently and quickly. Pike push-ups, and their full body counterpart, the handstand push-ups are just the thing.Keep your hands directly under your shoulders, and don't allow your elbows to flare out. The handstand push-ups can be done against a wall. For pike push-ups, around 2x15 is great, and even better is 2x5 handstand push-ups. Head to the ground and all the way back up, anything less is not full range of motion.Specific TrainingHere's how you do a kip-up. Sit down, feet out in front, knees slightly bent. Bring your back down quickly, placing your hands besides your ears and pull your knees up to your chest as fast as you can. This will whip you onto the upper back and hands. When you've reached maximum flexion of your body, push hard through the hands, and still keeping your knees bent, kick your feet upwards. This will create the air time for you to whip you hips up, then place your feet on the ground, and finally pull your torso towards them. Stand up from this squatting position. Remember that a kip-up is both a power feat as well as a skill. As such, even if you have everything else dialled in, getting the sequence right is crucial to success. You should always practice kip-ups on a soft surface, grass is ideal. When starting out, train the kip up on stretch of grass that has an incline, with your hands higher than your feet. Over time, find a less steep section, and eventually, you'll nail the kip-up on flat ground.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...I am able to do kip-ups, but I wouldn't consider myself a master of the skill yet. First of all, I am nowehere close to achieving one every time I try. Second, the arc of my back is not very pronounced, a direct result of me not getting enough air time, on account of lacking pushing strength and hip thrust. This in turn, affects my landing (very broad stance, a narrower stance makes it harder) and also in what direction I lean when I stand up (backwards in my case, which causes me to backpedal to keep my balance).Once you can do a clean kip-up with a good arc, a secure landing and a narrow stance, you can try the same thing with straight legs. Much tougher, much more rewarding. Ultimate mastery of the kip-up consists in doing it with straight legs, your feet already resting by your ears, a narrow stance upon landing, no backpedaling and your arms crossed in front of your chest. It will take lots of practice and hard work to get there someday, but if you become good at doing the standard version, you should get to the ultimate kip-up with smart and hard work. Can you do it on a decline with your head lower than your feet someday?Good luck!"

S" Copied from: Bhavesh Aggarwal's answer to What is the best way to build muscle in upper-body and arms through push-ups?1. Go heavyThere's no doubt about it. If you want to build muscle, you need to challenge yourself. You need to use a weight that you can only complete a relatively small number of reps (5-12) with. In the context of calisthenics, unless you gain weight, the load in and of itself is not changing anytime soon. You can use a weighted vest or a resistance band to increase the load in your push-ups. The extra load is scalable to your needs and goals.2. Go hardIf you can't get resistance bands or weighted vests, you always have the option of going the pure calisthenics way. If standards push-ups are too easy, here's a progression to make them harder:Bhavesh Aggarwal's answer to How many push-ups should I be able to do before moving on to one-armed push-ups?Of course, raising your feet is another great way to make push-ups more challenging. Doing them on your fingertips gets you a greater stretch on your chest, activating the muscle more, and netting your more strength and size. Work up to this, however. Do fingertip push-ups on the wall or high objects first. Alternatively, do them on your knuckles.3. Take FlightPush-ups can be made much harder and more productive by making them explosive, for example clapping push-ups. Be very careful, however. This can be rough on the joints even if you do everything right. Use a soft surface (and common sense!) and progress slowly.4. I call 'Dips' on the BarsDips are the 'full body' cousin of the push-up. Famed for their potential to cause shoulder pain, they should be done cleanly and only for as many reps as your technique is good. A good cue is to think of keeping your shoulders back and down at all times. If you experience shoulder pain (in the joint), look for alternatives.5. I have Planches for tonightThe push-up is a basic exercise, and most people will not gain a ton of strength from a standard push-up. Work on learning the planche (depicted below) and do your push-ups in that position.The leverage makes this much harder than just simply pushing your own weight like in a dip. Don't expect to get this right within a month.Image from WikipediaAlso, make sure your diet is dialled in. Pecs can look 'unfirm' because there's a little bit of chest fat on them. Nothing a clean diet wouldn't fix most of the time."

S" TL;DR: Yes, and there are two mechanisms that can make it happen.First, let's get clear on some terminology:Muscle: That's the big contractile organ, like the biceps brachii or the latisimuss dorsi. Muscle fiber: A cell withing a muscle. Contains many nuclei, and all the contractile elements, which are the basis for a muscles working.Motor unit: A group of muscles cells and the speficic neuron (nerve cell) controlling their contraction. In all muscles, a single fiber is always controlled by only one neuron, but a single neuron can control hundreds or even thousands of muscle fibers. The muscle fibers within a motor unit are all the same type. (more on that later)Myofibrill: This is a 'little fiber' within a muscle fiber. A chain of contractile elements, made up of the cellular organelles doing the work. A single muscle fiber contains many of these myofibrills.Traditionally, we distinguish three muscle fiber types, although histochemical staining has shown that we have around 7, with varying properties. They all fall along a continuum, however.Type I fibers are the most thankful of all. They can work at a low intensity for hours. Postural muscles are usually primarily type I fibers. Marathon professionals have muscles consisting of mostly this type. They burn sugar or fat, work completely aerobically, but don't grow much and can't exert a lot of force, nor contract very fast. Type IIa fibers are similar to type I fibers in that they don't fatigue very quickly. Similarly, they can burn both fat and glucose, and very importantly, depending on the demand being placed on them, they can release energy fast through the lactacid system, or help the body remove lactic acid. They contract relatively fast, and grow very big. Professional 800 meter runners have a lot of these.Type IIx (formerly known as Type IIb) are the fastest of the bunch. They contract fast, produce the most force per cross-sectional area, and fatigue very quickly. These are the fibers you need for short bursts of extreme power output, like a shot put, a 60 meter sprint, a vertical jump, or a hang clean. Their fuel economy is atrocious, however, and so, if you use these fibers often, without an absolute necessity for speed, some of them will convert to type IIb fibers. They can't burn glucose, only convert it to lactic acid, and tire out within around 45 seconds.There are two mechanisms that cause a shift in a muscle from slow-twitch to fast-twitch, and from fast-twitch to 'very fast-twitch'. The one we've known for a long time is almost stupidly simple. If you demand high-intensity, highspeed contactions, the type IIx and type IIa muscle fibers will grow in size, and therefore proportionally make up more of the muscle cross-section.What wasn't well-researched until recently, and still isn't well-known, is that muscle fibers can actually change their protein synthesis such that they make the kind of myofibrills that can contract faster, effectively making a type I fiber convert to a type IIa. This change comes from signalling mechanisms we don't properly understand yet, but in a nutshell, if you do high power movements with a strength and a speed component, and do so at a relatively low volume, you will cause the muscle fibers to change. They basically recommend various protocols to do so in the article, and rightly caution you against too much aerobic work, although that isn't a 100% rule. But that's a discussion for another time. And finally, having the right fiber types is just PART of your success in any sport, including power sports like sprinting. There are a ton of other things that feed into your performance, and both as an athlete as well as a coach, you do well to include everything in training, and not focus on one thing to the exclusion of all else."

S" Yes, you can always go the calisthenics route. Push-upsPush-ups build the chest, anterior deltoids, and triceps. They can be made harder by lateralizing and eventually doing them one-armed, as well as by raising the legs. Pull-ups Pull-ups are the yang to the yin of push-ups. They train the lats, the muscles around the scapulae, the rear deltoids, the elbow flexors, and the grip. If you do chin-ups, some of the work of the lats is transferred to the biceps instead, and so it will be more arm-oriented than a pull-up. Progress with weights, or work towards making them one-armed.Dips Dips work the chest, shoulders, and triceps, much like the push-up. They can be considered a harder variation of the same, and therefore lead to more arm size. Do these very cleanly, however. Once your technique breaks down, the set is over. Anything else is an open invitation to shoulder problems.Planche Push-upsPlance push-ups are really tough. They're way harder than dips, because of the leverage. They hit the same muscles as dips. Additionally, they will train your fingers too. Don't even attempt these until you've worked up to a planche first.Handstand Push-upsThe handstand in itself is a pretty decent isometric deltoid, upper chest trapezius, tricep, grip, and core/spinal workout. Going up and down adds a completely new dimension of strength requirements to it. If you can't do handstand push-ups yet, do pike push-ups, with increasingly elevated feet. You don't need to do handstand push-ups free-standing, by the way. Do them with your feet against the wall. We're training for strength, not for acrobatics. If the two-handed handstand comes easy to you, work on making it one-armed. Incidentally, a complete rep of a one-armed handstand push-up has never been caught on tape. Maybe you'll be the first to get there?Muscle-upsThe ultimate complete upper body exercise known to man, bar none (pun intended). The muscle-up is a mixture of a pull-up, a leg raise, and a straight bar dip. I uses all of the muscles involved in those movements, and also adds a speed/power component to your upper body work. You should be solid on pull-ups and straight bar dips first, however. Practice clapping pull-ups as a transitional exercise first. Be careful about this move. It's impressive, but you can hurt yourself really badly if you try it without the prerequisites being in place.Simply hang from a bar, and pull yourself up and backwards, past the bar, flick your hands forwards on the bar, and push yourself up so that your upper body is above the bar, and the hips are below it.Demonstrated on rings here, but the same principles apply.Adding a little bit of weight in the form of a bag filled with books (sand, stones, etc.) to some of these exercises helps a lot. You can do them without any extra weight, however.Images from Google."

S" If you have nothing but the floor at your disposal (no bars at all), by the far one of the best exercises is the elbow press. Zero equipment required, and lets you get a hell of a lats workout in. It's not as functional as a pull-up, though. Elbow PressesLie on the floor face up. Keeping nothing but your heels in contact with the ground, push through your elbows in an attempt to lift the body off the ground. Do not extend your spine (just keep it rigid), all movement must come from you pushing into the floor. If you're doing it right, you should be able to get your body off the ground until your lats can't shorten anymore.Tips:If this is too hard, bend at the hips when doing elbow presses. You can also elevate your upper body to make this exercise easier. Should you happen to not have a thick carpet or yoga mat at home to do these, use a pair of towels. Be careful not to slip. Mentally, it helps to think of this exercise as a 'lat push-up'.Here's yours truly doing some after pull-ups.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Some isometric exercises to hit your lat nicely (From Convict Conditioning):Hulk PullsGrab two vertical bar six inches (15cm apart) with your forearms held horizontally. Alternatively, kneel before an open door and hold on to the handles/knobs. Now, pull as hard as you can for 5 seconds, take a 10 second break, and repeat for a total of 5 sets. Bow PullsHold on to a vertical bar (goal post, lamp post, pipe), with one arm at chest height and the other at face height. Bend your arms slightly so that you are around 2/3 of an arm's length away from the bar. Now push with the upper arm and pull with lower one as hard as you can for five seconds. Then, without a break, push with the lower arm and pull with the other one, again for five seconds. Take a ten second break, and switch arms. Complete the entire cycle four times. Crucifix PullsStand between two bars (goal posts?) that are an armspan or slightly less apart. Hold on to them, and without bending your elbows, try to pull the, towards each other. Think about trying to bring your shoulder blades together. Hold for 10 seconds, pause for 5. Repeat 4 timesThese exercises are isometrics, so while they can't replace elbow presses or pull-ups, they're a great way to train the lats and other muscles occasionally.DipsDips also work the lats as a secondary muscle. It might not fit your definition of REALLY working the lats, but it can be a good assistance exercise. You don't necessarily need bars to do them. They can be done off of two chairs placed together or other high furniture. PlanchesA planche is a fiendishly tough isometric hold, and while it's not a lat dominant exercise, it's another great zero equipment kind of thing. You need a floor, and yourself. Start by doing them tucked, i.e. you knees curled under the belly, and straighten out over time. Once you can do planches, attempt a plance push-up. It's a great chest, shoulder, and triceps dominant exercise, but engages pretty much your whole body.Back levers fall into a similar category, but you need a bar for them. Which brings me to my final bit of advice:Pull-Ups... Wait, what?!You should look around for some pull-up bar alternatives to do pull-ups and inverted rows. For more info on that, see my answer: Bhavesh Aggarwal's answer to How can I do pull-ups without a pull-up bar?Images from Wikipedia, paraphrased text from Convict Conditioning by Paul Wade."

S" Beards are a weird thing. Prized among many men as a symbol of masculinity, often disliked among women as a sign of poor hygiene. Did your endocrinologist ever check your testosterone? It might be low, so that could be part of the puzzle. You can naturally boost testosterone by exercising (short term) and decreasing body fat (long term). There isn't a whole lot else. Maybe, you just don't happen to have many hair follicles in your face, or they're wired in a way that makes it hard for them to grow. It's unlikely to be a lack of blood circulation or something along those lines.That said, let's make one thing clear. It's not the beard. It's the wearer. Beards only work because they advertise manliness in a culturally defined way, and possibly your confident attitude. But that's all they do.Your beard, or lack thereof, does not define you as a person, as a human, or even as a man. You can either allow not having a beard to take away your peace of mind, or you can be mature about it, and understand that you're just different that way. If somebody rejects you or mocks you for not having a beard, know that they are not worth your time. Good people don't disrespect other people without sound reasons.I am a lot like you. Not beard-wise, but I am a short guy in a tall world. I carried that load on my shoulders and in my mind for a very long time. Then, at some point, it clicked. I am short. That's it. That's neither good nor bad, it just is. I can't change it, nor should I try. My value as a person doesn't depend on my height, nor on what other people think of how tall I am. In other words, even if I am only 90% the height of my peers, I am still 100% human. And the question isn't whether you are a short or a beardless human being. It's whether you're a good human being. Be the best version of yourself that you can be. Lots of wonderful things will happen for you, I promise.Learn to love yourself and work with what you have. It's the only path to relative sanity in this crazy world.Thanks for the A2A, Anon."

S" The three limiting factors are economy of time, geography, and money. If it's too expensive or takes too long (or too much money) to get to, it's out of the question. My ideal gym doesn't need many Nautilus style machines. I don't mind if they're there, but I don't need them. All I need are good, old-school barbells -with plates, of course- and dumbbells (ideally, the heaviest pair would be around 2x60kg), a squat rack and a bench. Maybe some bouncy plates for power cleans, but this is heavy fantasizing on my part. Apart from the free weights, I am a fan of resistance bands (with enough places to anchor them), weighted vests, and medicine balls. I would also like a TRX, wall bars, foam rollers, a Bosu and a gymnastics ball, boxes for plyometrics and elevated push-ups, and of course the space to do all my awesome calisthenics exercises, which can double as a stretching area.Speaking of calisthenics, an overhead bar with lots of space above it is a must. I don't mean one of those ergonomically shaped bars. I mean a standard overhead pull-up bar. Ideally, it would be a set of monkey bars, and there would also be a pair of adjustable dip bars. Rings for ring dips are are great too. A glute-ham-raise station is something of a dream for me.Finally, some good cardio machines for warming up or endurance activities in general.Generally, I'd like the gym to be spacious so people can do their work without disturbing -or worse- injuring each other. An area set aside for medicine ball throws would be great. The atmosphere should be friendly and open, but focussed on training. I like it when there are serious athletes training next to casual gym goers, a healthy mix of all sorts of people. It's especially important that the gym doesn't scare off women (or other gender minorities), and keep them from working out when they want to. The personal traininers around should be competent and compassionate, not a bunch of steroid-filled, agenda-driven duds. All the other folks working should be friendly and helpful too, within reason. I also like it when the gym sells high-quality supplements at a reasonable price, but that is really me being picky. I'd rather they don't sell anything than offer junk.Personally, it would be great to rent gym shoes at the gym (or hey, get to borrow them for free with my membership).The locker rooms and shower should be clean, well-lit and adequately large, just some common sense things. My reality is, that I train without being in a gym most of the time. All I need is a floor, a wall, perhaps a park bench or other elevated surface (stairs are great), and an overhead bar. Maybe, maybe, some light dumbbells. And that's a wrap.Thanks for the A2A, Kiran Kannar."

S" Nope. Dips are a great overall pushing exercise (if performed correctly), where your chest, triceps, and front deltoids get to do most of the work, in that order of importance. Triceps can also become the prime movers if you maintain a vertical torso.However, they can't match a military press in terms of pure shoulder engagement. Not a chance. The military press engages primarily the front deltoid, the lateral head as a synergist, and even the rear deltoid at the very end of the motion (near lockout). The degree of recruitment of the various heads also depends on how wide your grip is. The narrower, the more you're focused on the anterior deltoid, the wider, the more the lateral and rear head get involved. Be careful about going to extremes, however, as elbow and shoulder problems can arise from execessively wide grips (or behind the neck variations, the nightmare of a lot of physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons). If you're looking for a bodyweight alternative to the millitary press, I recommend the handstand push-up. Do pike push-ups first, and place your legs on increasingly higher objects. Your torso must always be vertical, or very close to vertical. Eventually, you can work on doing the handstand push-up against a wall. For an increase in challenge, you can work on lateralizing them, use a resistance band or weighted vest, and do them in a place that allows your head to go below the level of your hands (please be very careful, don't bash your head or injure your neck)Pike push-ups from a platform.As the other answerers have stated, you want to supplement the overhead press with some sort of rear deltoid dominant exercise. I don't necessarily think a pure lateral head movement is necessary, and I consider the side lateral raise to be a somewhat odd exercise. In real life, you rarely ever lift things in that way. You can greatly improve the benefits if you do them one-sided only, and alternating hands between sets. Lots more core engagement!The same goes for the rear delt raise. I have literally never seen somebody lift anything up in a bent over position like that. Use muscle groups as they are meant to be used: In unision. For rear deltoid exercises, I am partial to the pull-up. Sure, the rear deltoid head is not the prime mover. But again, you're using the muscles that should work together as a group, and in my mind, that trumps attempted isolation. If those are too easy for you, add some weight. You can also do elbow presses and reverse iron cross push-ups, but I don't find them as functional. Doing inverted rows, especially with raised feet, is a very good rear delt/lat/elbow flexor/grip exercise as well.Inverted rows with elevated feetAll in all, the military press is already a lot more balanced as a shoulder exercise than the dip, but you will especially want to add some rear deltoid work to keep your strength and size equal front to back."

S" Depends a whole lot on where you want to get and where you are right now. If you're an 800 meter runner, and this is about improving your speed despite having large amounts of lactic acid in your muscles, you're better of doing shorter intervals with comparatively long rest. For example, sprint 15 seconds, rest 45. Go close to all out. You can make these a ton harder by decreasing the rest intervals, but running the same distance in 15 seconds. The longer your distance(s) become, the more you're probably looking into improving your aerobic power, i.e. higher speed without build-up of lactic acid. So if you're a 10k expert, you want to do longer intervals at slightly lower speeds. Again, as an example, sprint 40 seconds, rest 20. Accelerate to 80-90% of your maximum speed. Increase the difficulty by making the work interval longer (and consequently a lower percentage of your max speed). Rest until you've mostly cleared the lactic acid from your muscles. This rest interval should steadily decrease and/or the distance covered should slightly increase over time.What HIIT can't do very efficiently is give you the capacity to finish a very long race. That is something you'll have to build up to with longer, slower running. I also recommned you look into intensive and extensive tempo as tools to improve your aerobic and lactacid power."

S" TL;DR: Maybe, but it's a bad idea.Circuit training is a great tool for conditioning, stamina, and even strength. It is, however, ONE tool out of an entire tool box. You don't want to do nothing but circuits. Second, if you're doing these workouts, even spread out over 5 days, you're training your whole body 5 times a week. That's a recipe for disaster. You don't want to train the same body part again within 48 hours, unless you're going very, very low with the total number of reps.Third, if you do that much on one day, your form will inevitably break down, and if you're doing the exercises wrong, your joints will pay the price.If you want to do this workout, do it on three non-consecutive days.

Meats, dairy, eggs, legumes, and grains will all provide the protein to prevent sarcopenia, and a lot of other essential nutrients that a plain protein powder, or creatine, can't deliver.Couple this with resistance exercise to cause the muscles to break down and then subsequently build up, and you'll have preservation of or even an increase in muscles mass.That said, consuming creatine can help with increasing your muscle mass no matter what age you are.

S" Taken from my answer:How do I increase my level of pull ups step by step?First, do vertical pulls:Work up to 2-3 sets of 30-40. This should be fairly easy for you.Horizontal pullsThese are a hard variation, but still a lot easier than a real pull up. Work up to 2-3 sets of 15-20. You can probably get away with doing fewer, but I still recommend you get at least 3 sets of 12.Chin upsThe chin up is the slightly easier brother of the pull up. The trick is to turn your palms to face towards you. This puts a little more load on the biceps than the lats and the posterior deltoid muscles, so most people have fewer problems doing them. You will find that you can do typically around 20-30% more chin ups than pull ups. NegativesSometimes, even though you can do a good number of horizontal pulls, you may fail to do a single chin up/pull up. Negatives, or eccentrics can help you get the necessary stimulation to finally bust out your first rep(s). Using your legs, a chair or a relatively low bar, get up into the top position of a pull up, and lower yourself as slowly as you can. Go back to the top position and repeat. You will soon gain the strength necessary to do pull ups and chin ups.Half RepsMany coaches dislike half reps, saying they build 'only half the strength', or that they don't translate well into the full rep. In my experience, these are both inaccurate. There are some individuals who do benefit from half reps, especially on the psychological front. Somebody who was always wanted to a pull-up and has now learned to do half of one will feel more rewarded than doing a negative pull up. If you can do half a pull up, train those together with negatives. You're likely to get to your goal faster.IsometricsYou can also practice an exercise by holding certain positions you attain in the process of doing them. For example, getting into the top position of a pull up, spend some time 'up there' before you come down. Do the same in the position where your arms are about parallel to the ground, and at the bottom position. You will get a feel for the entire pull up and build strength.GripSed Chapman often says one of the key reasons people can't do many pull ups or chin ups is their grip. This is especially a problem in the early stages, when you're capable of doing perhaps 4-5 reps. Try hanging from the bar for a while, without moving, to train your grip. If that becomes easy, decrease the number of fingers, or try to hold on with just one hand, working up to perhaps a total time of 3 minutes. Once you can confidently do that, your grip might well be the strongest aspect of your pull up.Transmission of force to the rest of bodyUsually, when you're watching a video on YouTube with a shirtless dude, the advice is going to be some sensationalist poppycock meant to make you buy a product. Here's a counter-example. Take it away, Jeff:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Maintain TensionSqueezing the glutes and the back will also help you do more pull ups and do them more easily. It's also important to train your core. As a rule of thumb, you should be hanging more like suspended pencil than a slab of meat.Increasing Reps with KippingNormally, you would want to do your pull ups strict and without any lower body movement. If you have reached your limit in the set, however, and want to do more pull ups, you can kip to get more repetitions under your belt. Over time, you will be able to do more repetitions without kipping. Never count the kipped reps as normal pull ups if you are keeping a training log, make a special note. Also beware that kipping might exacerbate shoulder and elbow problems, so please be wary of joint pains.Strength Pyramid HacksSuppose you are able to do a few pull ups with good form. After you have warmed up, do the first set with e.g. a 1kg kettlebell hanging from your foot, or a medicine ball stuck between your thighs. You will naturally do fewer reps. However, after resting a few minutes, come back to the pull ups and do them without the med ball/kettlebell, and you will be able bust out pull ups with better form and they will feel much lighter, possibly enabling you to blast right through your former max.Source for the top two exercises and their rep recommendations:Convict Conditioning 1All the best."

S' TL;DR: Yes, you can. And it\'s pretty simple too.Let me start by saying: I don\'t care. I don\'t care who you are, man, woman, neither, I don\'t care if you work on a plantation in India, weave baskets in Algeria, or herd sheep in Scotland. I don\'t care whether your environment is rural, urban, or neither. I don\'t care if you\'re 10 or 60, I don\'t care what race you are, what ethnicitiy, who your parents are, or how rich you are. It doesn\'t matter whether you live on a plot so large it could be a micro-state, on the streets, or in jail. A truly determined person can get a workout anywhere in the world.Whether you choose to go the pure calisthenics route, or throw in some improvised or acquired forms of extra resistance, you can become functionally strong, powerful, fast, and big using very little equipment. If I were your coach, the only thing I would ask for is your heartfelt commitment to the journey. Talent and pre-existing skill are immutable, and therefore of no concern to us. But exercise should be like a good marriage. You stick with it \'till death do us part.\'Before I delve into the \'How\', allow me to give some "dos and don\'ts".Do what you can handleIt seems obvious, but many people violate this fundamental principle. If you can\'t do an exercise right, you need to take your time and learn it properly before you run off chasing a high number of reps. There\'s no point practicing sets of 20 push-ups if you don\'t do them right. You\'ll only overestimate your strength, and end up hurting yourself, either acutely or over time. Learn the movement properly, and then work on making it yours. If you can\'t get it right yet, go back to an easier move, and work up from there. Be patient, and you will be continuing to get strong for many years to come.Do challenge yourselfThe other end of the spectrum is also often seen. For somebody who wants to become stronger, going from 50 push-ups to 60 isn\'t all that great an improvement. Going from a single one-armed push-up to 11 one-armed push-ups, on the other hand, signifies a great increase in strength! On that note, when you\'re \'maxing out\' with an exercise, i.e., seeing how many repetitions you can do in one go, stop the set when your technique deteriorates. Practice makes permanent, and if you practice less than stellar technique, that\'s what your body will learn and cement. Inviting sneaky injuries was never easier.Do \'milk\' every ExercisePeople are often in such a hurry to progress from one exercise to another (or one weight to the next) that they don\'t get all the benefits they could from an exercise. While I don\'t advocate doing hundreds of push-ups, there\'s an obvious difference in barely surviving 20 push-ups, and being able to breeze through confidently. Work towards that confidence with your weight/rep goals, as this also gives your joints and tendons the time to adapt.Do learn to improviseTo people working out at home, especially when on a low budget and working with mostly calisthenics, being creative is the bread-and-butter of training design. You need to learn to work with what your surroundings provide you and make the best out of it.Don\'t rush the PaceDynamic exercises, have a negative phases (lowering), one or two hold phases (isometric), and a positive phase (raising). You may lower yourself fast or slow, but it must ALWAYS be under control. Depending on the exercise, you are either meant to pause at the bottom for a moment, or bounce back up directly. This action too, must be controlled. As a rule of thumb, when training for strength, you are steering every single moment of the exercise. Take 2 seconds for moving up and down, wait for 1 second at the top of the movement, and where applicable, wait for 1 second at the bottom as well.Don\'t forget the BasicsEspecially when it comes to calisthenics, you don\'t want to forget the basic three: two-legged bodyweight squats, two-armed medium grip push-ups and two-armed medium-grip pull-ups. Keep revisiting these exercises in your training every now and then. You can use them to fix problems that have snuck up. Correcting your pace, form, or cheating can be done here, without exhausting you. They also make great specific warm ups, so keep them in your toolbox.The StartWithout working with you personally, it\'s hard for me to assess where you are right now, so you will have to do that in my place. Work with the basic 3 exercises I have mentioned. Push-ups, pull-ups and squats. Of course, depending on whether you have some weights at your disposal (usually dumbbells), various exercises like presses, deadlifts and weighted squats can be done.Start out with exercises/weights you can do at least 3 reps of confidently. If you can\'t do push-ups, do knee push-ups. If that\'s still too hard, elevate your hands. Accordingly, if pull-ups are too hard for you, do them off of a bar that\'s between chest and knee height, keeping your heels on the ground.Finally, if a full two-legged squat is too much for you, grab on to a table or similar object and start from there.Here are some answers on Quora to help you get to your first reps of said exercises (and beyond):Push-ups:Sed Chapman\'s answer to How can I learn how to do press-ups gradually?Pull-ups:How do I increase my level of pull ups step by step?Squats:Bhavesh Aggarwal\'s answer to What are some body weight leg exercises?ContinuingWhen it comes to increasing your strength, size, and fitness \'Progression\' is the name of the game. If your workout isn\'t challenging you, you\'re not going to adapt. Apart from those basic three exercises, you might find it useful to do some specialized core work. People often do crunches till they nauseate, but I don\'t like them, as they don\'t build much abdominal strength. You\'re better off doing things like planks, side planks, sit-ups and leg raises. I personally think you don\'t need to incorporate abdominal exercises until you\'re capable of doing a push-up, a pull-up, and two-legged squat, as these will work your core too, just not as the main focus of your exercise. As you progress with sit-ups and the like, you will want to find ways to make them harder. Planks can be made harder by lifting your limbs off the ground (or putting your feet on an elevated surface), while leg raises can be made harder by hanging from a bar. Sit-ups can be made harder by making them unilateral, holding out your arms and holding on to weight. Here is a more detailed explanation for sit-ups:The Sit-Up revisited by Bhavesh Aggarwal on The Quora Gym v.P.Note that while good core exercises will give you strong abdominal muscles, you won\'t get a visible six pack from doing them. You\'ll need to lower your body fat percentage to at most 8-12% to do that. You will also want to do exercises for your back (and in fact the entire muscle chain starting from the back of your head down the back and butt all the way to the muscles in the soles of your feet. I would also advise you to only worry about those once you\'ve gotten a goot bit of progress on the basic three movements above (and any dumbbell versions you may do), as they will give you a good foundation to work off of. You\'ll find some good exercises here:Train that Posterior Chain by Bhavesh Aggarwal on The Quora Gym v.P.For the legs, my first link details the full A-Z of training. Here are more answers/posts to advance with upper body training:Pull-ups:Bhavesh Aggarwal\'s answer to How can one best train to do a one-armed pull-up?Push-ups:Bhavesh Aggarwal\'s answer to How many push-ups should I be able to do before moving on to one-armed push-ups?Handstand Pushups by Bhavesh Aggarwal on The Quora Gym v.P.What is the best way to build muscle in upper-body and arms through push-ups?Putting it togetherSo now that we\'ve covered the basics and some progressions, how do you go about this all?TrainingAt the beginning of every training session is the warm up. Jog for 800 meters, or do a few dozen jumping jacks. Swimming, biking climbing, all of the low intensity activities that elevate your heart rate are ideal for this phase. This will get your circulation up and running, warm up your muscles, and mentally put you in the zone. After the intial warming up, continue with dynamic stretching. Here\'s a list of stretches you can do:http://www.brianmac.co.uk/dynami...Do not static stretch before your sessions! Ideally, do static stretching around 3-4 hours after your workouts, or on the days you\'re not working out.Once you\'ve warmed up with low-intensity stuff and some dynamic stretches, do 2 warm up sets with low reps of an easy exercise. For example, if you\'re practicing push-ups on that day, do 2 sets of 6-8 knee push-ups a few minutes before the main training. This will activate the right muscles and nerve cells, and increase blood flow to the working muscles. This part of the warm up is probably the most important!Main TrainingNow that you\'re warmed up and primed, do the main exercise(s) for the day. I advise you do to skill training at the very start, like when working on handstands. Follow this up with your strength stuff. In our example, this could be pike push-ups, or regular push-ups, or even a completely unrelated exercise like squats.Structure your work so that your main movements like squats and pull-ups are first, and things like core training, grip work and and calf training are last. In other words, things that involve many muscles as movers go first, those with fewer muscles (and smaller muscles) go after that. This is why you should also do your leg work before your upper body work on a specific day.Looked at over the week, as a beginner, 3 full body workouts on non-consecutive days are best. For example Monday, Wednesday, Friday, rest on all the other days. Every 8-12 weeks, plan in a week where you don\'t do as much strength work. This helps avoid pain, keeps you fresh, and can even kickstart your progress on a lift or exercise that has been stagnating.Once a year, take off two or three weeks entirely from exercising. Reps, Sets, RestOne thing many people ask is: How many reps and sets should I do? How much do I rest between sets?The answer is, as so often, "It depends." It depends on whether you want mostly strength and little size, size and strength, size, or endurance. Here are some rough guidelines on the matter, plus diet advice:Bhavesh Aggarwal\'s answer to How can a very skinny, 24 year-old grow muscles?When training for pure strength, keep the breaks long, 2-5 minutes. The more you\'re working on size or even endurance, the shorter the breaks become. I recommend you to read up on the subject. Books like \'Starting Strength\', \'Convict Conditioning (1,2&3)\', and many other will go a long way in providing you guidance where nobody else can. Look around and you\'ll find stuff that fits your situation. Apart from strength, you need to work on tissue quality, conditioning, and mobility. I will not go into these subjects, because there is A LOT of info on the net for free.And finally, here\'s my last bit of advice. You can improvise weights with a ton of different things in your environment. Milk cartons, rice bags, other people (particularly babies). For example, coming back to the shepherd in Scotland, grab a lamb and do your squats with it on your shoulders. As the lamb grows bigger, you become stronger. For some more ideas, here\'s a website to help you with makeshift weights:How to Make a Homemade Weight SetRemember that sand can be replaced with pebbles, and pebbles can be replaced with coins for added weight. Hat tip, Coach Ellis.'

S" Building upper body muscles with push-ups is dependent upon proper progression and overload. While I advocate also doing pull-ups for even development, that's a discussion for a different time. Let's focus on how to build muscles with push-ups. 1. Go heavyThere's no doubt about it. If you want to build muscle, you need to challenge yourself. You need to use a weight that you can only complete a relatively small number of reps (5-12) with. In the context of calisthenics, unless you gain weight, the load in and of itself is not changing anytime soon. You can use a weighted vest or a resistance band to increase the load in your push-ups. The extra load is scalable to your needs and goals.2. Go hardIf you can't get resistance bands or weighted vests, you always have the option of going the pure calisthenics way. If standards push-ups are too easy, here's a progression to make them harder:Bhavesh Aggarwal's answer to How many push-ups should I be able to do before moving on to one-armed push-ups?Of course, raising your feet is another great way to make push-ups more challenging. Doing them on your fingertips gets you a greater stretch on your chest, activating the muscle more, and netting your more strength and size. Work up to this, however. Do fingertip push-ups on the wall or high objects first. Alternatively, do them on your knuckles.3. Take FlightPush-ups can be made much harder and more productive by making them explosive, for example clapping push-ups. Be very  careful, however. This can be rough on the joints even if you do everything right. Use a soft surface (and common sense!) and progress slowly.4. I call 'Dips' on the BarsDips are the 'full body' cousin of the push-up. Famed for their potential to cause shoulder pain, they should be done cleanly and only for as many reps as your technique is good. A good cue is to think of keeping your shoulders back and down at all times. If you experience shoulder pain (in the joint), look for alternatives.5. I have Planches for tonightThe push-up is a basic exercise, and most people will not gain a ton of strength from a standard push-up. Work on learning the planche (depicted below) and do your push-ups in that position.The leverage makes this much harder than just simply pushing your own weight like in a dip. Don't expect to get this right within a month.Image from Wikipedia"

S' The muscles involved in the flexion of the lower arm are the biceps brachiibrachialisbrachioradialisThe biceps originates at the shoulder blade, and inserts at the radius. It can do arm and lower arm flexion, as well as supination (turning the palm upwards) of the lower arm.The brachialis is the strongest flexor in the elbow joint. It originates on the humerus (upper arm) and attaches to the ulna.The brachioradialis is technically a forearm muscle, but it too originates from the lower part of the humerus, and as the name says, attaches to the lower part of the radialis bone. It can flex the elbow as well as supinate and pronate the forearm.'

S" Disclaimer: Assessing you without having seen you personally is hard, if not impossible. If the popping when doing push-ups per se is painless (and the elbows remain painless after the push-ups), then you probably don't have to worry about it. Sound is not necessarily a sign of damage. The lifts may give you some trouble because even if a bench press is the same in principle, it's a different challenge neurologically, and your body needs time to figure this out. Grab somebody knowledgeable, like a strength and conditioning coach, and have them help you out.If they do hurt, I recommed doing the following: Check your form, making sure you distribute the weight as evenly as possible over both your hands and also all of the arm joints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, fingers). It's important to keep the elbows tucked in and close to your body, don't flare them out, but don't push them into your torso either. An angle of 30-45 between the flanks and the elbows works best.Should you be having a weak tendon, I suggest regressing to knee push-ups for higher reps, and doing ONLY the negative phase of proper push-ups. Once you're comfortable with those, say within a month's time, move to full push-ups again and see how you fare. If the problem persists, get a doc and have them check it out properly. Don't let them serve you some pain pills and advise you to lift less. That's not going to help. You might need a qualified physical therapist to (p)rehab."

S" Good bodyweight exercise for the upper chest all have one thing in common. They are pushing movements with the hands 'higher* than the shoulders. Elevated Push-UpsPush-ups with elevated feet hit the upper chest hard. When I say 'elevated', I mean elevated to somwhere between 50-70% percent of your height. It's a great way to make standard push-ups more challenging, and get that upper chest to work.Lady, tuck those elbows in! Pike Push-UpsPike push-ups are often done with the feet elevated (although the basic version is with the feet on the ground), but there is a break at the hip, so you look like a half-opened jackknife from the side. The arms are in line with the upper body, and your top half looks almost like it's in a handstand.Handstand Push-UpsMany will say that handstand push-ups don't work the chest. Not true. If you're truly locking out and squeezing at the top, handstand push-ups work the top part of the chest hard.Do them against a wall, most people will not be able to hold a handstand and do push-ups without quite a bit of training.Your hand placement should be roughly shoulder width, maybe slightly more. This is a little too wide, and provokes the elbows into flaring out.*If you would maintain the arm angle of any of these exercise, and stand up straight, the hand would be higher than the shoulders. That's what I am trying to say. Thanks, Marek, for catching the unclear wording!Images from Google."

S" For the purpose of this answer, I will assume that 'working out' means some form of strength training, rather than things like jogging, swimming, biking.The short answer is: No.Speed is a function of high force production in short amounts of time. In human physiology, that would be contracting a lot of muscle fibers as quickly as possible. Strength training helps you activate and build more muscle mass, which in turn allows you to produce more force. Clyde Hart, a sprints coach at Baylor Univerity even says:Strength and speed are synonymous.Considering the vast successes of his sprinters, men as well as women, we'd do well to heed his words. But he isn't alone, all serious sprints coaches have their athletes go through a rigorous strength program. This is just to bring the point that strength and speed are interdependent.I will even go so far as to say that between specific sprint training without a strength program, and a strength program without specific sprint training, the strength program is likely to contribute more to your speed than the sprint training, especially for beginners who don't have much basic strength yet.Thank you for the A2A, Nam Hong Hoi."

S" The BasicsAs you rightly said, you want to load up on carbs the days before, and take a high carb meal on the day of your race (starchy carbs about 2 hours before the competition, a banana 45 minutes before competition time). Be sure to hydrate well before the competition. 'Hydrate well', according to the IOC nutrition panel report, means  drink around 700ml of water about 90 minutes before the competition.Keep sipping a sports drink (e.g. Powerade) throughout your race to keep up on carbs and water, your average rate should be around 1.5 bottles (assuming 500ml bottles) per hour. However, don't drink too much at once, it will only slow you down.Water and carbs are the most important factors for a long-distance race like yours. But you already know that. So what's the sweet stuff you can do to boost performance?Adrenaline in a BottleNope, I am not asking you to inject anything. I am talking of the loved yet hated substance called caffeine. Caffeine stimulates your adrenal glands, cause them to release adrenaline (or epinephrine), increasing your reaction time, circulation in the brain, heart, liver and muscles, breaking down fat and glucose stores for quick energy mobilization. Caffeinated you has an edge over not-caffeinated you, so make the best of that benefit. The recommended dose, as per the above mentioned source is1-3 mg per kg body weight.Keep in mind that caffeine accelerates dehydration a little (even though drinking an average coffee is a net fluid plus) so you don't want to overdose on it. Also, if you're being tested, too much caffeine is considered stimulant abuse, so stick with the recommended dose.Check your brand of coffee and drink accordingly.ArginineWhen your muscles are working, they produce small amounts of NO to cause local vasodilation. They use arginine for this subtle but important function. An arginine supplement can help keep up the supply of nutrients to your muscles. This will mainly boost your initial performance.MultivitaminsAs Sed correctly noted, a multivitamin the morning before the race is a good idea. The mulivitamin will supply you with all those essential cofactors in various energy-releasing biochemical reactions. Provided it's high-quality. Else you're just drinking acids you will have to (possibly painfully) piss out again. Save yourself the pain, go for a reliable manufacturer.Other supplementsLactic acid buffers or creatine won't work long enough to be relevant to your long-distance aerobic event, so you're better off avoiding those. Creatine doesn't help for slower, aerobic stuff, and lactic acid buffers can cause nausea and vomitting. Plus, the effect is only good for a few minutes.Note on IntakeIt's generally recommended to not experiment with supplements on the day of the competition. As well are individuals, and manufacturers use different processing methods, we might not all react the same way to a substance, or the method of delivery. Expermint before competition. On the day of your race, you should be following your plan, not be in the process of writing it.ConclusionThere aren't many supplements out there that can credibly boast to enhance your performance - without being banned- but the basics hold up to scrutiny time and time again. Stick to water, carbs, some caffeine, maybe a multivitamin. Stay away from other stuff. It will cost you money, and might be useless at best, and harmful at worst. Thanks for the A2A, Scott Paglia."

S" Getting internships during winters is really tough in India because most engineering colleges have holidays for not more than a month during winters. So getting an internship in a firm is almost not possible because it is highly unlikely that a student can make a positive impact on the firm in just a month's time.But it is possible to get internships in prestigious Indian colleges like IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi and so on. But again, it solely depends on the need of professors. If they are working on some project and they really need some people to help them in those projects then they may provide you an internship at a very low stipend. But stipend doesn't matter much in college internships. You get to learn a lot doing such internships.You will have to contact professors directly over email and have to convince them that you are a good candidate suitable to work on their ongoing project (if any). So again, chances are very slim.What I did during my winter vacations after 3rd semester is, I joined Winter school in IIIT-Delhi. This is an amazing program that is done in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University. They select around 50 people from all over India and there were people from IIT Kanpur, IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, IIIT Hyderabad, BITS Pilani, VIT, MIT, etc.This is a 15 day program and is divided into three tracks. The tracks are handled by the teachers from CMU and IIIT Delhi. There are lectures by professors from prestigious colleges in India. You also make a project under the guidance of your track instructor. The exercise is both knowledgeable and fun.But you have to pay for this winter school. The fees was minimal at our time and I guess we paid around 6000 rupees which included fooding and lodging as well. If you live in Delhi or have relatives here then you have to pay just for the course. But trust me, it's worth it.Here is the link of the school which held in 2011 - Internship Program in Technology Supported Education.

S" As others mentioned, it solely depends on what you are looking for in your life. It's like eating one type of food daily versus trying different cuisine belonging to different cultures all around the world.There is no denying that working in a tech-giant, at least in India, you will have very few opportunities to actually develop something. You will mostly be working on supporting the product or doing minor improvements. India has potential but it is not yet recognized by the west. In a startup, you might have the opportunity to develop things from scratch. But again, there will be disappointments. It might be possible that you work on something for 3 months, prepare an amazing feature which is ready to go live on your website and the CEO or team lead decides to scrap it off. Decisions are usually made on the fly in startups.In India, there are two types of startups. One, which are started by people still studying in college or just out of college. This is a small group of 4 to 5 people and most of the time do not have any idea of what they are doing. They just have an idea to build something and they start doing it without having any plans for the future. Such startups do not survive for more than a year.Another type of startups are the planned ones. These are usually founded by people who have some experience in the industry and they know how to build workflows for projects, how to plan things and how to proceed with the development along with the motivated employees. Failure rate of such startups is comparably low. And in this case, you can have proper guidance from people who have actually worked with the stuff you are building.Tech-giants will pay you a lot. You get complementary stocks, free food, team outings, and a lot more which might not be offered in the startups. But if all these things doesn't matter to you, and the only thing you are looking for is growth in careers, then you should join a planned startup.In India, now even the startups are paying comparable package as that of tech-giants (like Amazon, Google, Adobe, etc.). They do not have the perks offered by leading tech companies, but if you are young, you might not even care about these perks. On the other hand, if you want stability in life, if you want to settle down, then it is best to join one of the tech-giants and plan to work there for a continued period of time."

S' Thanks for the A2A, but this question is not significant anymore. Earlier this year (2015), Quora had pulled off the role of Moderators on their website.Now there are "trusted reporters" on Quora instead of moderators. All the people who were moderators are by default trusted reporters and they have most of the powers that they used to have when they were moderators. One plus to this arrangement is that now anyone can become a trusted reporter. If a normal user constantly report bad stuff and most of their reports are genuine then they might also become a trusted reporter and will have the power to collapse answers right away.Even though the answers reported by trusted reporters get collapsed right away, they are still sent to the reviewing queue of admins, and admins have to power to revert the operation of a trusted reporter.One difference is that moderators used to have the power to lock and delete questions but trusted reporters do not have this power. Trusted reporters\' power is pretty much confined to just the answers written on Quora. But yes, their reports carry significant weight and given higher priority than a normal user\'s reports.Moderators used to have a separate dashboard which showed the number of answers and topics that need to be reviewed. It also showed the statistics of other moderators, i.e, how many topics and answers top 5 moderators have reviewed in a particular month.'

I know at least about Jaipur, Jodhpur, Delhi, Chennai and various cities in West Bengal where you can find amazing table tennis coaches who can train you very well and get you ready to represent India at international level (of course, it depends on how dedicated you are).But if I have to select just one coaching institute then I would most definitely go for Petroleum Sports Promotion Board's table tennis academy in Ajmer. It is one of its kind and is considered as a Mecca for table tennis players in India. They conduct a trial every year where they invite applications from top players all over India (in cadet and sub-junior categories). The number of selections depend on the number of free slots which changes every year.The perks of being in PSPB academy Ajmer - You are trained by two coaches. One, Chinese and the other, a local Indian coach. Both these coaches are international players themselves with great experience of coaching over the years.You get to play with the finest table tennis players in India. Everyone knows that in order to improve your game you need to play with people who are better players than you. In fact, a lot of good Indian table tennis players, including A. Amal Raj, have spent their early days in Ajmer academy. You get to play in one of the finest table tennis stadiums in India. Ajmer table tennis stadium is HUGE, with 12 table tennis tables and a seating capacity of more than a 100 people. You get free boarding, lodging and schooling. They will even bear the expenses of your tuition and other miscellaneous activities. All you will have to focus on is table tennis. You will have to play at least 6 hours in a day (morning and evening).You get to play all major tournaments in India. PSPB team is also invited for Zonal tournaments.So if you are passionate about table tennis and is of right age then practice hard and get into the academy. Even if you are more than 14 years of age, try to spare a month or two and go and train in Ajmer. If you are a decent player, they might even allow you to play with PSPB players and train with their coach."

Since you had to ask a question on Quora, I think you are already confused.First of all, do you have an absolute passion for coding? Do you want to make a difference in the world with your coding skills? If yes, then go for masters and after that go for a PhD. You have got a very good rank in GATE so you should get a top IIT, if not IISc. Trust me, this will give a real boost to your knowledge of coding and computers in general. I have done an internship in IISc Bangalore and I know how high the level of postgraduate students in IISc (or any other top college in India, as a matter of fact) is, as far as their knowledge of computer science is considered.On the other hand, if you have chosen this line only because you want to earn and enjoy your life spending that money then stay in the job. Doing a masters for two years might fetch you just a slightly better job with a slightly better package. Yes, the promotions will definitely be faster. In fact, with a masters degree, you will reach a managerial position much faster than your bachelor counterparts. But again, if money is the only motivation, you would get enough of it even at a second-to-manager position. There is no need to waste 2 years of your life for this.So just be sure what you want. Neither of the above options are bad. Even though the Indian youth is inclined towards getting a masters degree and then may be go for a PhD, there are a lot of people who just love working in startups or MNCs and live a comfortable life with the earnings.Just be sure what gives you the inner satisfaction and go for it.'

S' In our college project we used the HMM (Hidden Markov Model) algorithm to train a model to detect credit card frauds.The model is first trained with a certain number of past transactions by the customer and the probability of that observation sequence is calculated by using HMM. When the user makes a new transaction, that transaction is added to the previous observation sequence and the probability of the new observation sequence is calculated. If the difference between the two probabilities is less than the threshold value then that transaction is accepted as a genuine transaction else it is tagged as fraudulent transaction and the customer is notified about it.But there were a lot of loopholes in this approach and we had to make a lot of assumptions. Even though they were calculated assumptions and we did some research and also gathered data from other research papers but in the end they were just assumptions and they highly increases the risk to use such a model in real life scenarios.For example, the biggest problem we faced was to set the "threshold value" below which the transaction can be accepted as a genuine one. In real life scenarios, you will need the data of thousands of customers in order to guess such a threshold value and even after that you cannot be completely sure that your model will work.'

S' To answer the question, she called them "after" finding the money. But finding the money was not the reason to call the cops.She told Mike that she found the money in the suitcase while unpacking. She obviously shifted to ABQ after Matty\'s death and while unpacking she found the money. She might not have given much thought to it then, as she was grieving. Or even though she might have found this suspicious she might have decided not to think about it that much as her husband was already gone.The reason she called the cops was the death of Hoffman and Fensky. Remember, Mike left Philadelphia the next day after he killed those cops. And now he is working in Albuquerque for at least some time. The daughter-in-law didn\'t get to know about the deaths right away (Mike didn\'t tell her when she took him home when he arrived in ABQ). She might have got to know about this through some old neighbors or acquaintance in ABQ. As soon as she got to know about this she called the PD inquiring about the case.May be they were already looking for Mike to take his statement about the cold blooded murder of the two cops, and didn\'t know that he was in Albuquerque (which is very strange considering that he is working in a government office). While talking to the PD she might have mentioned that Mike is also here. So they came by. She also might have thought that mentioning the money and her thoughts about her husband\'s character might also help the PD to look for the murderers.While talking to Mike she said "Yeah, I called them to help catch Matty\'s killers. What if the same person who got Matty, got them too?". This indicates that she called them when she heard about the shooting of the two cops and knowing about the money was not the main reason to call the PD.'

S' Mike was always going to be the second lead on the show. I am not sure if there will be any more "breaking bad" characters in the show and whether they will take the lead roles or not but Mike had a pretty strong character in breaking bad so it was only fair that he would have gotten an equally important role in "Better Call Saul".I think Chuck\'s story was limited to letting people know the past of Saul aka Jimmy. There might be a tad bit more of it but I don\'t think he is gonna play a major role in the coming episodes and seasons.'

S' Considering who he was after, I don\'t think it was crazy on Jimmy\'s part to go inside the tent without any backup.He knew that Kettlemans were not very "smart" and he also knew that they were not the kind of people who would hurt someone, let alone in front of their kids. Sure, they were involved in the embezzlement of funds but they were not criminal by nature.Jimmy still telephoned Kim letting her know that he found the kettlemans camping in the mountains and the police was already looking for them so if the need be, he could have played that card and tell the kettlemans that police knows he is there with them.He had no fear of the kettlemans. That\'s why he made quite a comic entry into their tent.'

S' I think the reason is pretty straight forward. Nacho is the brightest of them all and he saw an opportunity when Jimmy mentioned kettlemans and their 1.6 million dollars. As Nacho revealed later in the episode, "he wanted to rip them (kettlemans) off" and for that he wanted Jimmy\'s help.Nacho knew that Mijo was a thick headed person and he was ready to kill Jimmy just out of anger because Jimmy helped those two knuckleheads who called his grandma a biznatch. He knew that killing or hurting Jimmy would not help anyone in any way. It was better to save him and make some easy bucks.'

S' It\'s definitely weird, and to some extent, desperate of Marv to seek help of Deeds to rob the bar. It was like the director was short of people to cast so they used a recurring character.But there can still be an explanation. Deeds was a kind of person who was not afraid of anyone or anything. He was a kind of person who doesn\'t think twice before doing anything. And Marv needed such a person to stand against the Chechen mob.He might have thought that no other goon will help him as they were all probably afraid of Chovka. Also, Deeds was supposed to have an excellent street cred as he killed the "Glory Days". He was supposed to be the tough guy who kills someone and talks about it as if he is having a conversation about Cricket with someone.It might be possible that Marv already had plans for Deeds.

S' Because Bob was just too honest to do something like that. As I mentioned in one of my other answers, he was a kind of person who believed in non-violence until the time it is acceptable and tolerable. He also didn\'t believe in injustice.How many times we see a person picking a heavily injured dog from someone else\'s trash can, take care of it, and is ready to pay 10,000$ for it? Bob probably believed in a just world. Where everyone plays the role which has been assigned to them.It doesn\'t mean that Bob was weak. He killed "Glory Days" and when it was too much, he even put a bullet in Deeds\' head. But he did that only when it was too much for him to tolerate.He was also a loyal person. He was not a rat like Marv (it may be wrong to call Marv a rat because he probably did it out of frustration of losing his bar and income to Chechen mobsters).Marv knew all these things about Bob. He knew that Bob would never agree to be a part of his "plan" and he could have even tried to stop Marv from doing such a thing. No, he wouldn\'t have gone to Chovka complaining about Marv.

S" I think Bob was a type of guy who never wanted trouble. He was a very calm person and during the entire movie he never lost his cool. Even while putting a bullet in Deed's head, he showed just a little signs of anxiety. During the robbery, he didn't try to stop the robbers, didn't panic or provide any kind of hindrance (Marv's reasons of not showing any resistance were understandable as he was in on it).I believe he would have given Deeds the money, had he came to his house earlier that morning. Even at the bar he would have handed him the money if he didn't bring Nadia into all this. He kept the gun just in case something goes south. I think he never intended to use the gun.Another thing, he was not going to hand the money to Deeds just like that. He expected Deeds to give him the registration papers of Rocco so that Bob can get the ownership of the dog. I think Bob believed in non violence until the point it is acceptable and tolerable."

S' I think it came from the Chechen mobsters as a reminder of what happens to people who screw with them. Bob gave the crucial piece of information to the police that one of the robbers was wearing a broken watch which was stopped at 6:15. I think Chovka (Chechen mobster) had connections in the police department and he got to know about this broken watch thing from them. When Chovka came to see Bob and Marv the next day, he already had that one robber in his car bleeding to death. Even though they didn\'t show his face (or the watch), he was probably the same robber who robbed Marv\'s bar.May be Chovka had his doubts about Marv or Bob because the robbers knew that Marv\'s bar was going to be the "drop" bar. So, it has to be an insider\'s job. But Chovka couldn\'t take the risk of prosecuting Marv because he was his trusted companion for 10 years. So, Chovka played a little and decided to set Marv\'s bar as a drop bar for super bowl night when the cash was supposed to flow like water. And Marv was stupid enough to try to rob it once again.That\'s the reason why no questions were asked when Bob and Marv returned the money to Chovka.Could Marv have planted the bag himself? Possibly, but I think the chances of Marv doing this are slim.First, why would he cut the arm of the robber and plant it in his own bar? I mean, it does not send any message to anyone. If he wanted to convey that nobody can screw with him then he should have sent that hand to Chechen mobsters to let them know that he took care of the people who robbed him.Also, why spoil the money with all the blood when he knew that he will have to deliver the money to Chovka anyway and will have to clean it up?Another thing, his reactions when Bob asked him to look into the bag was of disgust and fear. It looks like he didn\'t know what was in the bag and he didn\'t even want to know.'

S' I am not sure. I would say it\'s a 50-50 chance. There are a few things that do not resonate with the fact that the North Korean government could have been involved in this hack - 1. The only thing that links North Korea with this cyberattack is the movie "The Interview". But if you look at the original hack then there was no mention of the movie. The hackers didn\'t say anything about it in the statement they issued to Sony pictures. Nor was it mentioned in the message that appeared on the employees\' hacked computer screens. The threats to not release the movie started almost a week after the hack.2. This was a well planned attack and would have taken at least few weeks of planning, if not months. I don\'t think at that time North Korea would have the knowledge that a movie like The Interview, which is based on a plan to assassinate their supremo, was under production. So, the attack was not made just to stop this movie from airing.3. Almost everything points to the fact that this is an inside job. It was like the hackers knew the entire structure of Sony\'s network. They even had hard coded paths and passwords in their code. 4. There is no solid evidence that points towards the involvement of North Korea in the attacks. The attack was initiated from Bangkok and it was routed from China. Also, with the advancement of Internet, it is possible to mask the attack from anywhere in the world. Unless an attacker openly takes the responsibility of the attack and declares their affiliations, I doubt that FBI and NSA would be able to prove North Korea\'s involvement.All these points do not rule out the involvement of North Korea in the attacks but certainly bring down the likelihood of their involvement.'

S" Oh yes, definitely. This has stirred the debate on how important security is to a top IT firm (or any other firm as a matter of fact). Most of the big firms spend a lot of time and resources in security training of their employees. Employees are taught not to click on any suspicious links, to not use office internet to browse the web or sites that can bring a potential malware to the firm's servers. Downloading movies or audio/video files is banned in most of the IT firms. But no matter how well you protect your servers and data, there will always be people who would find a flaw in your system. MySpace was pretty confident about their security mechanisms until a single person brought down their entire network and gave birth to a new type of attack which got his name, Samy. Apple is one of the leading IT firms, and even they couldn't protect their users' data.It's not like the laws against piracy are lenient, it's just that in most cases it is almost impossible to track the hacker. Even in Sony's case, both FBI and NSA are just speculating that the attack originated from North Korea. It's almost a month and they do not have any solid evidence about who did it. Basically, there is no one to whom this law can be applied.People will talk about how important security is, for few days. All the big firms will make a training course for their employees explaining how Sony got attacked by the hackers and ask them to be careful and not repeat Sony's mistakes. People will just somehow complete that course and then get back to doing what they have to do."

S' Is there a way I can give it a 3.5 stars on Quora?Well, I have mixed feelings about this episode. Actually, the entire show is getting a little bit repetitive? It feels like we are not going anywhere. The group wanders, meets another group of bad guys, kill them, one of the not-so-major character of the group also get killed, the group of bad guys is not completely destroyed and the few left, retaliate, our group once again fight them and kill them all.The same thing happened in this entire season so far. In the end, the guys at the hospital are just another group of bad people (because of circumstances may be) who crossed paths with Rick\'s group and both sides witnessed a lot of bloodshed. And I also don\'t think that this entire hospital scene is over. I am pretty sure our group is gonna come back here in the future.But as I have said again and again, the acting of all the characters in the show is commendable. Rick, Daryl, Michonne, Carl, all of them are so deep in their characters that it almost comes naturally to them. I loved how Rick didn\'t give a second thought before killing Bob (the cop who escaped in the last episode). He might not have done the same thing in season 1 or season 2. I also loved all those emotions that flowed in the end. Daryl crying, probably for the first on the show, was heart-touching. Beth\'s death was not so unexpected as I was pretty sure that someone\'s definitely gonna die during this entire "deal" and the chances of Beth being that someone were sky high.Even though it is almost easy to guess what is gonna happen next in the show, the show has not lost its charm for me. The element of surprise is still there. Little, but there. And of course, the thrill that you experience in the moment of action makes this show one of the best shows currently on air. But I would really love if the makers of the show can give us something different. For example, I know that the group is gonna spend the next half of the season wandering on roads fighting zombies and looking for a safe haven. I am definitely ready for a surprise. Please do something more eventful.'

S" It depends on what type of person you are and how you want to spend your time in college. If you want to study then IIIT-A would provide you a perfect environment to reach the sky in the field of academics. If you want to enjoy then IIIT-A will give you wings to fly. I will answer it from a perspective of an average student (yours truly) who studied a bit, played a lot, had fun, made some amazing friends and had a memorable time studying in IIIT-Allahabad.Weekdays - Wake up at 8:30 for 9:00 A.M classes. Compulsory attendance is the most irritating thing about IIIT-A. You have to maintain at least 80% attendance and it is hard to mark proxies in most of the classes which means you have to attend most of them. 9:00 A.M to 6:00 P.M - Theory classes + labs. Well, thanks to the teachers of IIIT-A, most students just sit and play with their cell phones or read novels in class. Most of the teachers do not mind whatever you do in their class unless you start talking to each other. They just want to peacefully deliver a lecture they thoroughly mugged up before coming to the class and go. So people usually do not interrupt them by asking intelligent questions.Another irritating thing about IIIT is the labs. Neither the teacher nor the TAs know anything about any of the practicals you are supposed to do. But they still won't allow you to do something else even if it is related to academics. You have to sit for 3 long hours doing nothing. Labs are a complete waste of time in IIIT-A.Post 6:00 P.M - Evenings are usually fun in IIIT-A. Some people play cricket or football in the ground. Some go to volunteer for Prayaas. Some people just walk on the road in front of the boys hostels or sit on the divider with friends and talk for hours. Couples go to civil lines or roam around the campus until they find a silent corner where they can talk God knows what. People who are irritated by messy mess food turn their heads towards cafeteria. And the people who love to study grab their books and laptop and head towards the lab where they irritate and annoy the shit out of couples who are trying to gossip/fight sitting in the corner of the lab hiding behind their books.Nights are usually spent in the rooms playing games on LAN or sending stupid messages and bhajans on IP messenger. Or just listening to very loud music until the guard comes and asks you to turn down the volume.Between 12 to 3, it's time for post dinner meal and people often head towards H&D or Malik dhaba. It's chai sutta chronicles all over again.On weekends - Weekends are actually boring than weekdays. You wake up somewhere between breakfast and dinner and try to finish the things you planned for the weekend. Again, cricket and football. Pool and table tennis. And then it's the time for civil lines. Everyone wants to go to civil lines on a weekend. People shout and run behind the buses and then book an auto when they miss the bus. Guys ask their girl friends to keep hold of a seat for them in the bus. And then there are people who want to study on weekends as well. So yeah, they pack their laptops in their bags and head towards the lab.Weekends are also utilized to complete the work of copying assignments from the one guy who actually took the trouble to do it on his own and who is not sure whether he did it right or not. Weekends are also utilized for the meetings to discuss the ideas for semester projects but those meetings often end with a long discussion about classmates, professors, director, or even guards.Not to forget, the awesome morning tea with bread and butter in that small shop in the Peepal gaanv.And those tireless visits to the stationary shop on the morning of the project presentation. And the entire group of friends asking for permission to go to washroom during exams so that they can cheat.Well, that's what the life in IIIT-A is all about. There cannot be a single answer for this question as it is highly subjective. But it was definitely fun for me. Especially the last year, when you get placed in the beginning of the year and you have two entire semesters to have fun.P.S - I missed the part about the booze parties and the marijuana marathons because I was never a part of them so I have no idea how to describe them."

S' I would say it is optional and its presence should depend on the years of experience you have working in the industry. If you are a recent college graduate then it is always a good thing to have an "objective" in your resume. Not that a lot of people would read it while interviewing you but it at least show, to some extent, your ambitions and the reason you want to do a job and not go for higher studies.Once you have some experience working in the field then, IMO, there is absolutely no need of putting "objective" in your resume. The recruiters know what your objectives must be and they would be more interested in the projects you had done/is doing in your previous firm then knowing that you want to join their firm for "career growth".'

This show has an awesome plot (taken from the comics of same name), great character development, and it never seizes to surprise or thrill you. Almost all the seasons are terrific and each and every episode takes the serial further, there are no stale episodes in any of the season so far.2. The Sopranos - If you loved movies like The Godfather or Casino or any of the mafia movies then you will surely love this serial. James Gandolfini, as a mafia boss in New Jersey, did an amazing job as an actor. Also, the soundtrack of this serial is amazing. Even the side characters did an amazing job. Edie Falco and Michael Imperioli brought life to the serial. I would say "The Sopranos" is the best drama ever aired on the TV (even better than The Wire and Breaking Bad)3. Breaking Bad - This is all about Bryan Cranston. The character development of Cranston from a high school chemistry teacher to a drug lord is amazingly portrayed in this serial. While watching this serial you will feel like you are experiencing all that drama in real time.4. Sherlock - It is difficult to not like this show. So much nerdiness and such great acting by Benedict Cumberbatch. 5. Modern Family - And just to add a pinch of humor in all this drama. This is one original show with genuine jokes. And the best thing about this show is that it let the audience decide whether they want to laugh at a certain joke or not. There are no irritating background laughing sounds that play with each and every stupid punch line. Especially the characters of Luke and Phil are extremely funny.'

S" As I have mentioned in some of my related answers on Quora, Carrie is not an emotional person overall. She was never an emotional person. Brody was the closest she came to being a sentimental person. She has little love for her sister and father. This has probably something to do with her being bipolar. Carrie is not a type of person who can handle babies. She LOVES her job. The only reason she kept the baby was that she truly loved Brody and probably wanted a part of him to be with her (even if Brody somehow made it to the US, he would have been arrested and sentenced for life). When Brody died, she came to her senses and realized that she cannot handle the responsibility of a baby. That is when she wanted to go for an abortion but her father and sister stopped her from doing so. So, she didn't love her baby even before the baby was born.That said, there is no doubt in it that the Baby was Brody's. Earlier, Carrie didn't want anyone to know this thing. She didn't even tell Brody that she was pregnant with his baby until they were in the safe house in the last episode. Again, she was tremendously confused whether she should give birth to this baby or not and probably that is why she didn't tell anyone about it."

When Dar Adal and Saul had a conversation in the restaurant in season 3 finale, Dar was pretty convinced that Saul will come back to CIA in a heartbeat if Lockhart comes begging to him. And Dar knows Saul better than most of the people in the show (I think even better than Carrie).2. When Carrie asked for Saul's services to strengthen the security in American embassy in Pakistan, he didn't even think twice before making a decision. He just wanted an excuse to be a part of all this CIA adventure.Another explanation can be that he wants to protect Carrie. He is the one who recruited Carrie and she has always been under his umbrella. The fact that she is out there chasing the bad guys and Saul cannot put tabs on her anymore must be making him uncomfortable.I am pretty sure Saul will find a way to remain in Islamabad (or may be the circumstances in the next episode will make him).

S' It all depends on how mentally strong you are.First scenario - You wait for the good job and do not get depressed when people around you are getting placed. When that job opportunity arrives, give your 100%. If you get in, well and good. If you didn\'t, you can think that you were already going for an off campus job so it doesn\'t matter much. But this is the difficult and uncertain path. What if that "good job opportunity" didn\'t show up? Companies do not commit. They visit campuses based on their current requirements. Most of the good companies (at least in IT sector) try to visit campus in the beginning of the placement season so that they can filter out the toppers and good candidates (exceptions are always there and some good candidates are definitely left out). So, chances of having a good company visit your campus at a later stage of placement season are less.Also, your surrounding is changing. All your friends are getting placed. Even that guy who used to get less marks than you is placed. The girl you used to make fun of for being dumb? She is also placed. Everyone is happy and partying and making plans to go on long trips with college friends for the last time. And you are sitting in your room, cramming the same shit again and again. Trying hard not to think how much fun they are having. Trust me, it is difficult.Second scenario - You take a mediocre job (which is not your dream job). This will give you some satisfaction and a lot of confidence. You still have to work hard but at least now you will have a back up plan. You will not be afraid anymore. You can even take out time from your studies to have fun with your friends. If you are good in what you do, then you can easily get a job off campus. From the wordings of the question, I am pretty sure you are an IT engineer. There is currently a lot of boom in the IT sector and companies are going gung-ho about hiring bright people.Also, this opens up a few other opportunities for you as well. Now you can also think if you want to go for higher studies or not. Now that you would have a job, you can search for some good internships that can give your resume a real boost up. You can actually take a deep breath and think about your options.If I were at your place, I would have gone for the second choice. But as I said earlier, it differs from person to person. If you are mentally strong and adamant and you think that your surrounding and the pressure won\'t affect you or your decisions then you should surely go for the first choice.

S" Disclaimer - The answer below are my personal views.There are a lot of benefits of working in Adobe India. First of all, I do not have any experience in working with any other firm in India so I am not sure if these benefits are provided by other firms as well.1. Work life balance - This is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Adobe. You get ample amount of time to do things you like other than work. You can easily follow your hobbies and get the work done at the same time. Adobe has a gym, four table tennis tables, two foosball tables, a lawn tennis court, a basketball court, 7 cricket teams, an informal guitar club, a toastmasters club, and so much more of the fun stuff. And these things are not for namesake. People actively participate in all these activities and they do not have to work overnight to compensate for the time they spent doing these things.2. Awesome food - If you are a north Indian and a foodie, Adobe is going to be a haven for you. They have a sodexo which prepares delicious food and snacks. The best part is that both lunch and dinner are free of cost (dinner is generally not free of cost in most of the firms in India). Breakfast and evening snacks are available at minimal price. They do not have a fixed menu so even if there will be a repetition in what you eat, you will certainly not get bored with the monotonicity of the food. They also have a juice center and street food stall (golgappa, chaat, etc.)3. Opportunity to work with some of the great minds in country - Adobe has some very good engineers. This is true that just like most other product based companies, the work will be repetitive after you have worked here for a certain amount of time but you will get to learn new things from the people who have decades of experience working in the industry.4. Employee stock plan - Also know as ESPP. Adobe let its employees purchase Adobe's stocks every six months by setting aside up to 25% of their payroll. The price at the start and the end of six months is noted and stocks are given at 15% percent discount on whatever price is less. So you are definitely gonna get a profit of 15% even if the value of the shares goes down in those 6 months. The lock in price (which is set at the time of enrollment in ESPP) is valid for 24 months and hence this plan is very profitable in the long run. I have not seen a lot of firms in industry that has such a plan.Apart from these, there are all the other benefits like frequent health check-ups, celebrations on account of major festivals, fun activities for your kids and family members, insurance plans and all the regular stuff that is provided by most of the companies.Overall, I see Adobe India as a great employer. And I am glad to be a part of this firm."

S' Steven has a very nice theory of Lockhart ratting out Sandy. Lockhart was definitely uneasy when Carrie told him that she knows that Lockhart knew Sandy was trading top secret information in exchange of the locations of terrorists. And his uneasiness makes sense because he authorized the demotion of Harris. So if it is proved that Harris was right and Sandy was indeed doing a "business" with the terrorists then Lockhart would be the first one to be hanged.But even though it has been established that Lockhart was doing something very wrong, I don\'t think he was responsible for leaking the photo of Sandy to the press. When Sandy reached his informant\'s home, the lock on the door was changed. Which means either the informant has turned against the CIA or the terrorists have identified the source of CIA\'s intel and asked the informant to lure Sandy in a trap. They smartly posted the photos online just after Sandy left the station. They also didn\'t show their face to Sandy and let the crowd take care of him.Another explanation, which is more likely, according to me, is that there is one terrorist who wants all his associates/partners dead. He is definitely anti-CIA but it is easy to handle your enemies than your friends. I think someone is trying to shoot two birds with one arrow. They first feed information to CIA about the location of other terrorists. In exchange they get the top secret information from the CIA. According to Carrie, all the information provided by this asset was pure gold apart from this wedding instance. How can someone who knows this much about these terrorists didn\'t know that Haissam Haqqani was actually attending a wedding in Islamabad? I think the informant knew this thing and they also knew that bombing this wedding would put CIA\'s back to the wall and will probably deflect them from this case (Lockhart was exactly following this approach when he decided to keep Carrie at Langley.)I am pretty sure that Lockhart never interacted with Sandy\'s informant. I think he didn\'t even know who he/she was. He just knew that Sandy was getting the information and since it was profiting him (Lockhart) he decided to keep his mouth shut about it. This way, if the story accidentally unveils in the future, he can simply say that he didn\'t know anything about this asset and there would be no proof to prove him wrong. So all the terrorists had to do was take care of Sandy and then no one would ever know about this "secret informant" of CIA. They got rid of Sandy and now this is gonna be very hard for Carrie and Quinn and Saul to get the whereabouts of this informant.'

S" There can be two possible explanations for this - 1. The most important one, according to me, is that Carrie needs Saul back. She needs his support and intelligence. It is tough times for her and it is going to be tougher when her enmity with Lockhart will probably grow in next few episodes. I think we might see Saul in Islamabad (on behalf of his agency, of course) in the next episode. I don't know if it comes in the jurisdiction of a station chief to make such decisions but from the looks of it, it seems so.2. She probably thinks that it was the security team's responsibility to keep a tab on what the CIA personnel do. Apparently, no one had any idea about Sandy's informant(s). There had to be a pretty strong connection between the two parties. They must have talked several times on phone and in person. Yet, no one knows a thing about this unknown informant. I understand that this is a secret information but I also think that Sandy was way out of line (by CIA standards) in getting this information for the CIA (or for his boss?)I don't think the makers of the show paid much attention to provide any details here. It was pretty casual conversation and it seemed to me that Saul was actually expecting this conversation. A person like Saul, agreeing to something like that in a blink of an eye is not a small deal."

S' I can provide my subjective opinion here.Carrie\'s character was never an emotional one. It is clear from the epilogue of season 3 finale that after four months of Tehran incident Carrie moved on in her life and was pretty excited about the opportunity to work as a station chief in Istanbul. Apparently, she didn\'t feel "love" for her own baby. For Carrie, it has always been about her job and her career. The only person she ever got emotionally attached with was Brody and probably because of that attachment she decided to keep his baby.Now about the incident. She didn\'t care on emotional level. She told Quinn, "The worst case scenario is that it was a real wedding but who do you think will come forward and witness that? No one." (not her exact words, but close.) Not once she showed any sign of regret or guilt or dejection. She was more worried about her job because now she and the embassy need to give an explanation to the foreign minister about what happened in Pakistan.She was obviously troubled because she acted on a half cooked information and now have to take all the heat but I highly doubt that she was stirred on emotional level.'

S' My reasons are almost same as Virali\'s. I am very picky about the blogs that I follow on Quora. I follow the popular and interesting ones but I almost never follow new blogs (I know this can be argued as not providing enough opportunities to new writers for them to prove their worth, but I compensate for that by upvoting a lot of "unseen" content.)The reason I do not follow any blogs immediately are -1. Their notifications hinder the visibility of notifications for answers on questions I follow. Just like blogs, I follow just a few selected questions. So, I read each and every answer that is written for those questions. With the advent of blog post notifications, I panic seeing so many notifications and in frustration, usually clear them all in bulk (and regret later). I know I can use new Quora design of sorting the notifications based on categories but I don\'t like that design either. Also, I have this OCD of clearing each and every notification that I get on any social networking site.2. New people usually don\'t know Quora very well and at first write copied content as blog posts. There are hundreds of science blogs, sports blogs, latest news blogs, "interesting and cool stuff" blogs on Quora and most of them copy the articles from newspapers or other blogs on the internet (mostly without attribution). I know people learn with time, about how to better use Quora, but again, I am not one of the persons who can help them with that.So, I just ignore any invitations to join blogs by people I don\'t personally know.That said, if I know someone well and have respect for their writing, I would at least accept the invitation to follow their blog. I may unfollow it later based on my interest in the content of the blog, but I would at least give it a try.'

S' It differs from platform to platform and even on a certain platform there are a certain areas where you can find well mannered, sensible people and there are areas where you can find rude and arrogant *dudes*.For example, on Facebook there is a page named "Humans of New York" (a nice page, you should like it if you haven\'t already). A guy takes pictures of people from New York and ask them to tell him something about their life. Something small or big, that is significant to them and they have probably not shared it with a lot of people. And the stories people tell him surprises me. They open up with him and share their darkest secrets, their embarrassing mistakes and their beautiful romance. They allow him to write all those things on his page and he does. The most amazing thing is the response from the users in terms of the comments. I have never seen such a supportive crowd anywhere on the internet. Sometimes I read the stories and I feel like people must have written all the crap in their comments because that\'s what people do on the internet but with this page, it is exactly the opposite.Same does not go with a lot of other pages I follow on Facebook. For example, anything related to Cricket is taken very seriously in India and I can see people posting all kind of shit during major cricket tournaments. They engage with others in pointless debates, use derogatory remarks if the conversation is not proceeding according to their own perception of something.Another thing is religion. People just get too hyper when it comes to religion. Someone from the Pakistan writes a comments on some Indian page, all the Indians are over that guy, saying all kind of crap to him (and vice versa).I originally loved Quora because people here were supportive and rational. They used to reply to my comments sincerely and without taking any offence. I have observed that it is changing with time. Recently, I got some pretty rude comments on my content and I had no idea what should I comment as a reply to them (I am not going to take names here). I don\'t understand why people find it difficult to digest the fact that different people can have different perspectives.Sometimes I feel like some people do it just because they get a kick from it. They love trolling. They love when people swear at them but actually cannot do any harm to them. Well, I don\'t think we can do anything about those people.'

S' I cannot speak for myself because, according to me, I have a lot more followers than I deserve. But I agree to your general point, there are many good writers on Quora who are just unnoticed and there are a lot of reasons to account for this behavior. Off the top of my head I can think of three major reasons that, according to me, explain this phenomenon.1. Quora\'s machine learning algorithms - Whenever a new person joins Quora, they are asked to follow some people who Quora thinks would bring quality content to the user\'s feed. Most of these suggestions are established writers who already have a lot of followers and have written hundreds of answers. Rarely, a new budding writer makes the cut. So the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer.2. Popularity bias - No matter how much you deny it, in your heart you have to agree that when there are two answers written for a question, one of them from a Quora celebrity and another one from someone unknown, you will probably just read the first answer and even if you don\'t like it wholeheartedly you will still upvote it because you know that the person, overall, is a good writer. Even if the second person has written a good answer, you will probably not give it as much attention as you gave to the first answer. This limits the circulation of new writers\' answers.3. Indian population on Quora - Indian population on Quora is sky high. So if someone writes something that shows "Indian-ness" they are likely to get a lot of views on their content and if the quality of the content is good, a lot of followers. Even if you are a good writer, but you only write on topics like US politics or baseball, or rugby or anything that is not popular in India, you are probably not gonna get all those Indian followers.There are a lot more other factors that decide one\'s popularity on Quora. But again, as Xu said, after one point of time, it all just feels useless.'

S' Personal taxation in the UK is low by Western European standards, but high compared to the US.The basic rate of income tax is 20%, but you do not pay anything on the first 10,600 that you earn in any given tax year. When your yearly annual earnings exceed 42,385 you pay 40% on whatever you earn over that amount. There is also a 45% band on income higher than 150k which was introduced as a "temporary measure" by the outgoing Labour government in 2010, but few crane operators would be affected by that.As well as income tax, UK employees are subject to national insurance (NI) at 12% on earnings over 155 per week, and 2% on earnings over 815 per week. Despite the name this is really just another income tax, although the number of years you have paid NI will be taken into account if you intend to retire in the UK.This is where things get complicated, because NI is not paid on company dividends. Historically, independent contractors have avoided NI by setting up limited companies and paying themselves a nominal wage, then distributing the rest of the earnings to themselves as dividends. This loophole was all but closed in 1999 via legislation known in the tax industry as IR35.However, there are still advantages for the employer (and in some cases the employee) of people being paid as sub-contractors, so the practice continues. Post-IR35, it is unlikely that you will be expected to set up your own company and so you are likely to be paid as a self-employed individual, which in theory means you have fewer employment rights. Even that isn\'t the end of it though, as more recent legislation extends employment rights to contractors if they have worked for the same company for a certain length of time.All income tax and NI are subtracted from employee\'s wages before you are paid, so if you are an employee you do not need to keep any money aside to meet your tax bill. If you are a sub-contractor though, you will probably be given your full wages and be expected to submit a tax return at the end of the year. Most high-street accountants will offer payroll services and tax advice to contractors in this position. On balance, it\'s much easier for you to be an employee.You can calculate your net salary using online calculators such as this:The Salary Calculator - 2015 / 2016 Tax CalculatorThat calculator says that if you earn 175 per day and work 240 days per year, you will earn 42k gross and 31,647 after tax.'

All these things might happen but they are quite unlikely and I don't need to screw up the rest of my life planning for them.Violent home invasions are an overstated threat because the overwhelming majority of people who might break into your house would prefer to do it when you are not there. They are not looking for a confrontation, they just want to steal some stuff that they can sell and be on their way. Most often, if a burglar does accidentally enter your home while you are in and you announce your presence by switching a light on or making a noise, they'll be running away sharpish.The exception to this is if you have been specifically targeted because the criminal knows you and wants to exact some revenge or retribution. If you're not mixed up with criminal gangs this is very unlikely to happen to you. You could get unlucky and be the random victim of some psychopath who wants to break into a stranger's house and do unspeakable things to them, but if you are actively planning for such an event you probably watch too many horror movies. Furthermore, it's unlikely that anyone willing to invade your home while you are in it is going to warn you in advance or knock politely before storming in, so you're going to need to sit with a loaded gun within easy reach every minute of every day for it to do you any good. And if it isn't locked away safely the chances of your gun being used to shoot you or someone you love, either by accident or in a moment of anger or stupidity, exceeds the benefit of any protection it offers you. Guns kept in homes are more likely to be involved in a fatal or nonfatal accidental shooting, criminal assault, or suicide attempt than to be used to injure or kill in self-defense.- Injuries and deaths due to firearms in the home.The negative consequences of keeping a gun in your house are worse than the consequences of not having one. It doesn't guarantee your safety in the unlikely event that someone breaks into your house to confront you and it introduces lethal force into your everyday environment.

S" Wikipedia tells us that:Capitalism is an economic system in which trade, industry, and the means of production are privately owned and operated via profit and loss calculation (price signals) through the price system.A good way to judge which is the most capitalist country might therefore be to rank countries by how easy it is to operate a business there. The World Bank Group's Doing Business website ranks Denmark as the easiest place to do business in the EU, followed by the UK, then Sweden, Norway and Finland:Ranking of economies - Doing Business - World Bank GroupAnother way to determine which country is the most capitalist would be to rank them by the percentage of the workforce which is in private sector employment. This time the Scandinavian countries are way down the list due to their large public sectors, with Spain, Germany and Italy leading the way and the UK mid-table:Challenges for Public Administration in Latin America (see figure 2.1)A variation of this method would be to rank the countries by public spending as a percentage of total GDP, with the more capitalist countries being those with a lower percentage. The winner here is Slovakia, with other countries from the former Eastern-bloc close behind and the northern countries bringing up the rear:List of Government Spending as % of GDPAlternatively you might decide that the most capitalist country in today's global economy is the one which attracts the most foreign investment. Investors seek returns, and so investment will go to countries which offer profit opportunities without excessive corporate taxation. By this measure the UK is the clear winner:Foreign investment into UK is highest in Europe and second highest in worldThe overall picture is therefore inconclusive. The UK might be the most capitalist country in the EU were it not for its large public sector, and the Scandinavian countries are also good places to do business in spite of theirs. It ultimately comes down to which criteria you want to judge it by."

It can make personal relationships difficult because it can be difficult to judge the motives of people seeking to make their acquaintance.A wealthy entrepreneur I know once appeared in The Sunday Times Rich List [1], an annually compiled list of the richest people in Britain, due to a business deal which took place in the public domain.

Peter's PPE from Oxford trumps my degree in Industrial Economics from Birmingham on matters of political philosophy and I've learnt a great deal from reading his answers.I don't want to speak for Peter here but I think one difference may be in our approach to utilitarianism. Peter is fairly clear in his rejection of utilitarianism and has opined that any policy which results in a worse outcome for a single individual, even if it improves the outcome for everyone else, is morally inferior. He wrote a great answer about this which I have searched for and been unable to find.I'm more equivocal on this and I'm happy to support an outcome which delivers the greatest benefit to the greatest number, within reason and so long as there is no discrimination or arbitrary selection. Inequality is inevitable and will tend towards a Pareto optimum, so I hold that public policy should be aimed at maximizing social mobility rather than eliminating inequality itself.Peter has been heavily influenced by John Rawls' A Theory of Justice, which I have not read.

As part of that process "middle class" became a pejorative used to describe a certain breed of professionals and business-owners who enjoy higher-than-average incomes and the privilege associated with that. Within the demographic in question, it is used in a similar, ostensibly self-deprecating (but actually celebratory) way to mock their own sense of entitlement and superiority.Example: It\'s awful, Cordelia was home from boarding school this weekend and she sprained her ankle getting out of the Range Rover after we\'d been for tea at the Wolseley.

S' Not by any definition of socialism that I accept.Part of the problem here is that the word "socialism" has become almost meaningless as it means so many different things to different people. Over the last hundred years such an astonishing range of atrocities and economic disasters have been foisted upon the world by people calling themselves socialists that modern socialism has become a wearying process of redefinition and revisionism. Some would have you believe that any system other than unrestrained anarcho-capitalism is socialism. If there is a government which levies taxes in order to provide a public service, that is evidence of socialism in action. The government builds roads and organises a water supply? Socialism. Schools for the poor and social security payments for the unemployed. All socialism!Such a broad definition of socialism is nonsense. To be meaningful, any definition of socialism must address ownership of the means of production in order to contrast it with capitalism. Socialism promotes common ownership of the means of production, either by the state or perhaps by decentralised workers councils, as opposed to private ownership as in capitalism. It is not enough to have a generous welfare state, such as exists across most of northern Europe, if the majority of production rests in private hands. The relationship between socialism and common ownership has been well established through time, not least in the British Labour Party\'s Clause IV, which was finally removed from the party\'s constitution at Tony Blair\'s behest in 1995. An economic system which combines mostly privately-owned means of production with some state-owned production or significant economic intervention is described as a mixed economy, and a political system in which an elected government promotes a mixed economy incorporating a generous welfare state is best described as social democracy. These are the systems which operate in Scandinavia.Furthermore, faced with concerns about the sustainability of their model, Scandinavian countries have been liberalising their economies and moving away from socialism in recent years, rather than toward it. Personal tax rates have fallen from their post-war highs, while Sweden has been busily privatizing its education and healthcare sectors for the last twenty years:Private healthcare: the lessons from SwedenSweden proves that private profit improves services and influences policyCapitalism and private enterprise are alive and well in northern Europe and it is an abuse of terminology to describe the Scandinavian economic model as socialism.'

S" Because, despite the bad press it gets, the Conservative Party is not an ideologically-driven machine which hates the poor. There exists within it a range of political opinion and methodologies.One of the principles which binds today's Conservatives together is a broad commitment to equality of opportunity not equality of outcome, but this is a fairly vague principle that can be interpreted in a number of ways. The extent to which individual Tory MPs think individuals born into a disadvantaged environment should be given government assistance varies greatly. A common theme though is that transfer payments should be seen by their recipients as a temporary crutch rather than a permanent lifestyle choice; a safety net not a hammock. Some see tax credits as a useful way of encouraging people to leave a benefits-only environment and accept low-paid work.The danger is that tax credits for the working poor simply encourages employers to put a lower value on unskilled labour because it is effectively subsidised by the state. This doesn't provide the clearly defined route out of benefits dependency that many Tories are looking for. They would prefer that the market price for labour incorporates the true cost faced by workers rather than a subsidy, and they support the tax credit cuts on that basis. But there is also a pragmatism which stems from a desire to keep getting elected. Tory MPs who won their seats from the LibDems at the last election are mindful that they need to be seen as more compassionate if they are to retain their seats next time around. They recognise that they should be seen to do more for the poorest in society. And even though Corbyn's Labour doesn't represent a significant electoral threat, the merest possibility of him becoming Prime Minister in future (and all the horror that entails) motivates them to occupy the political centre-ground and ensure it doesn't happen. Those MPs are opposing the cuts to tax credits.At the 2015 Conservative Party conference we saw Boris positioning himself as the leadership candidate promoting this centrist position, with Osborne representing more of the same and May advocating a move to the right. Whether Boris is the natural leader of that faction and whether or not people trust him is another matter, but he is attempting to define the manifesto of the One-Nation Tory."

In a pre-capitalist society these savings had no useful purpose; their owners might buy art, treasure or spend the money on more castles. In a capitalist society, the banking and finance industry takes savings and lends them to entrepreneurs who require investment capital, thereby accepting much of the risk of doing so.

Unlike the redistribution of wealth under a socialist system though, the wealth is lent not given, and it is expected to generate a return.This re-utilisation of savings provides enormous benefit to society and is responsible for the success of capitalism.'

S' It would almost certainly result in a reduction in tax revenues, as well as a shift of the tax burden from the richest in society to the average earner. I present two pieces of evidence to support this.Firstly, the socialist French president Franois Hollande introduced a 75% top rate of income tax shortly after being elected in 2012. Individual income tax revenues fell by 4.9bn in the year following introduction of the new tax rate, contributing to a total revenue of only 16bn in contrast to the French government\'s prediction of 30bn. The 75% rate has now been dropped and the top rate is back down to 45%.France forced to drop 75% supertax after meagre returnsHollande\'s 75% \'Supertax\' Failure A Blow To Piketty\'s EconomicsSecondly, during the 1980s, the top rate of income tax in the UK was reduced from 83% to 40%. During that time the proportion of income tax paid by the top one percent of earners increased from 11% to 25% [1]. To put it another way, the tax burden on the 99% was less when there was a top tax rate of 40% than it was with a tax rate of 83% (75% of total income tax versus 89%).As the French have recently discovered, confiscatory tax rates lead to capital flight and are counter-productive. As soon as you raise tax rates beyond that which the wealthy consider "fair", they will simply stop paying them.[1] Sunday Times leader, 11th Sep 2011.'

She was forced out of her health ministry job after announcing that most UK egg production was infected with salmonella (a claim which later turned out to be true) and had a four-year affair with the future Prime Minister John Major. She was notorious enough to have her own puppet on the satirical TV show, Spitting Image, and established her own media career after losing her parliamentary seat in 1997.

As such, it would make sense for it to be abolished and incorporated into income tax, but this is politically awkward as it would make the tax system more transparent and people might realise their marginal tax rate is higher than they thought. There is also an additional element of National Insurance which is paid by the employer and which the employee never sees in their payslip.If you are living and working in the UK, you are obliged to pay the relevant taxes. Historically there were loopholes which allowed self-employed people to operate through a limited company and avoid National Insurance but these have been all but closed by the government via legislation known as IR35.Note that around half of British people also contribute to private pension schemes, either independently or through their employer. These pay out in addition to any pension they are eligible to via the state pension scheme.'

However, there have been occasions when they have used NHS facilities, such as the time Prince Charles broke his arm while playing polo and was treated at NHS hospitals in Cirencester and Nottingham. Furthermore, although private hospitals do exist in the UK, they tend not be as expensive as their equivalents in the US where healthcare costs are particularly high.

Anything which contained wet goods like fruit juice or sauces should be cleaned first.The green bin is for garden waste like grass cuttings and leaves. However, uncooked vegetable waste like potato peelings can also go in here.The black bin is for all non-recyclable waste so this is where leftover food scraps and and other waste like crisp packets go. This waste can be messy so we use sturdy black plastic bin-liners in the bin we have inside, and then transfer the waste in the tied-up bag to the outside bins when it is full. The bin-liners we use are of the 40-litre variety.Other councils have a different recycling system and some of them have more bins so that the initial sorting can be done by the residents themselves.

The value of their currency is propped up by more successful Eurozone nations like Germany.This works to Greece's disadvantage and makes recovery less likely.

S" Not every policy debate can be framed in a simple left/right or liberal/conservative paradigm. A person's views on economics can exist independently from any views they might have about gun control, abortion, foreign policy or the death penalty.Unfortunately, these political realities are obscured in the United States because of its two-party system. Republicans are usually associated with a more liberal (in the original sense) approach to economics, along with opposition to gun control and abortion and an interventionist foreign policy, while Democrats tend to adopt the opposite position in those areas. These policy bundles, while convenient, are artificial. Even amongst Republican Party members you will find libertarians who do not favour interventionist foreign policy, or people whose views on abortion are not influenced by religious belief. In countries with more fragmented political systems such debates are generally more nuanced and less interdependent.Sanders has strong views on economics and the redistribution of wealth but he doesn't seem especially interested in the gun control debate. This may be because he has no strong feeling on the subject or it may be because his own personal views contrast with those of many of the people whose votes he covets. I imagine he doesn't want to dilute his message on inequality by alienating anyone over gun control. There is no clear or obvious link between left-wing economics and gun control. Sanders argues for one but not the other. Somebody else might disagree with him on both. That's OK."

They aspire to an idealistic scenario where democracy and Western freedoms can flourish, even though there are too few people in the region who actively pursue those values. They support rebels fighting against secular dictators right up until the point at which they become theocrats, then start looking for someone new to support.This brings Russia into conflict with the West because the West currently support the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and Russia does not. That is the main bone of contention because everyone hates ISIS and no-one outside Turkey pays much attention to the Kurds.So from a Western perspective the Russians are attacking the wrong people because they are targeting the FSA more than ISIS, and because their weapons are perhaps not quite as technically advanced as the Americans there is also more in the way of collateral damage.

Their UK operation is entitled to assume responsibility for some of the expenses incurred by their US hub and they would seem to have engineered the accounts in this case in order to wipe out their taxable profit.Our legislators need to respond to this and figure out how to make it more difficult for multinationals like FB to export all their profit. There's no point whining about FB acting in their own interests because they have a duty to their shareholders to do so and it would be negligent of them to pay a penny more tax than our laws require them to.

S' Diana didn\'t play by the rules and, worse still, she wasn\'t prepared to carry on "taking one for the team".Being a royal in the modern era isn\'t a case of lying on a bear-skin chaise longue while eunuchs stand by your side peeling grapes and dropping them into your mouth. It\'s a tough gig which requires a great deal of personal sacrifice and, while Diana wasn\'t entirely oblivious to this, she was a naive young woman who didn\'t fully realise what she was signing up for. You toe the party line, you don\'t make a fool of yourself or the monarchy and if you\'re not happy you just have to suck it up and find a discreet outlet, preferably one such as going fishing in the Scottish Highlands.Diana either wasn\'t able or willing to play along. The knowledge and experience she gained of public relations was turned to her own benefit and not that of the family. She persuaded us with consummate ease that she was the Queen of Hearts and her husband was a cold fish. Her role was to produce an heir and keep quiet but instead she put herself in a situation which still gives rise to rumour and innuendo long after her death:- Diana\'s son Prince Harry (left) and Major James Hewitt (right) with whom Diana admitted having an adulterous relationship. The defining moment of the decline in Diana\'s relationship with the royal family was her interview with Martin Bashir on the BBC\'s Panorama in 1995: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Her performance broke every rule in the book. She not only admitted her own infidelity but also confirmed that of her husband. It effectively forced the case for their divorce and she then further annoyed the family by announcing it herself.There is no doubt that Diana did a great deal of creditable charity work but there is little other reason to suggest that she was the kindest princess who had ever lived. Likewise, it might be a little strong to say that the Royal Family loathed her, although they may have come close after Panorama first aired. It was an unfortunate union which didn\'t end well for anybody.'

S' The problem is glaringly obvious to everybody else; guns are far too easy to obtain in the US and that makes these kind of attacks inevitable. The fact that so many Americans are in denial of this is a source of incredulity in Britain and, I suspect, elsewhere in Europe too.Allowing ordinary civilians to arm themselves with lethal weaponry causes a lot more problems than it can ever solve. It hasn\'t stopped the federal government from becoming all-powerful as the founding fathers believed it would and it doesn\'t help the good guys defend themselves from the bad guys, because real life is not so simple as "good guys" and "bad guys".The argument goes that the criminals and terrorists will always be able to get hold of guns anyway, so it\'s better that law-abiding citizens can have them too to restore the balance of power between good and evil. There are several problems with this.First, how many school shootings in America have been carried out by terrorists or criminal gangs, and how many were carried out by previously law-abiding citizens who did not have an existing criminal record or any reason to be under observation by the authorities? Professional criminals don\'t go around shooting up schools because it isn\'t good business; it doesn\'t provide them with an income stream and it attracts a lot of attention. And while terrorists have targeted schools in places like Nigeria, in the West they\'ve historically preferred economic targets like the airline industry, railways and offices. School shootings are the domain of the disgruntled misfit, loner and attention-seeker.Second, most criminals in places like Britain don\'t have guns either. The penalties for possession of a firearm are so high that it\'s not worth having one on you (or even in your house) because it\'s a permanent piece of evidence the police can find and use to lock you up. Criminals who need a gun for a specific job, like a hit or just to intimidate a rival, will deposit the gun with a patsy and only carry it themselves for the shortest possible time. The total supply of guns available to criminals in the UK is so low that there have even been cases of the same gun being used by opposite sides at different times in a conflict between criminal gangs. Likewise, it\'s much easier to track the flow of guns to terrorist groups in an environment where guns are unusual and not part of the normal landscape. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, British intelligence had a fairly good idea of exactly how many guns the paramilitaries had, where they were stored and who controlled them.School shootings happen because of an over-supply of guns. We all knew kids at school who gave us a hard time and who we probably fantasized about exacting some revenge on, and there\'s always a few who will make that into a reality with whatever means they have at their disposal. Teenage boys do a lot of dumb stuff. If they live in an environment where they can acquire lethal force without raising any eyebrows, bad things will happen from time to time and you won\'t know where it\'s going to happen or when.As for the solution, that\'s a bit more difficult to identify. You can\'t just get rid of all the guns in America because it was a frontier society until relatively recently in its history and there is still an ingrained culture of gun ownership which promotes guns as normal and healthy. There would be a messy revolt if you simply tried to outlaw all guns across the country tomorrow, but perhaps the big cities could be demilitarised first as they have tried to do in Chicago. There is no sound justification for people in densely populated urban areas to carry guns. And maybe the next step would be to outlaw people carrying guns beyond the boundaries of their own property. At least then you would be in a position to arrest anyone on their way to school with a weapon. A gradual cultural change is required, in which Americans start to recognise the prevalence of guns in society as a threat rather than a safeguard.The most batshit-crazy idea I\'ve heard is that school shootings could be prevented by arming teachers as a matter of course. All that does is increase the supply of guns in the classroom still further. Who do you fancy in the struggle to get to her handgun; fifty-year-old Mrs Miggins who teaches history or a seventeen-year-old boy who has watched a few survivalist videos on YouTube and has the element of surprise? By the time Mr Hardman the football coach has stormed the classroom with his Uzi, the kid has wiped out half his classmates already. Seen from the other side of the Atlantic, anyone who believes that teachers need guns is living in some kind of dystopian horror movie.Finally, I don\'t think there are any more mentally unstable people per capita in the US than there are anywhere else. If you believe that then you should try going to France sometime, where neurosis seems to be part of the national identity. The difference is that in the US, they can all lay their hands on a gun.'

S' There are three main factions who want Britain out of the European Union, whom I shall glibly refer to as the xenophobes, the Little Englanders and the socialists. The xenophobes believe that Immigration is a major problem. As the EU guarantees freedom of movement, they see immigration from Eastern Europe in particular as a source of cheap labour who come to "take British jobs". They overlook the simple principle that more population equals higher demand, and that someone living in Britain while doing a decent job for a competitive wage is creating new opportunities for someone else. Some of the xenophobes also believe that many immigrants are "benefit tourists" who come to Britain in order to take advantage of our generous welfare system, again overlooking the simple principle that people who are dynamic enough to emigrate are rarely lazy or workshy. Xenophobes read the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, two tabloid newspapers which pander to their fears and prejudices.The Little Englanders don\'t like the idea of England (or the United Kingdom, but usually just England) being part of a wider community. There is some crossover with the xenophobes but their focus is more on EU regulations imposed on the UK by Brussels (seat of the European Parliament). They lap up hyperbolic articles in the Daily Mail which propagate euromyths such as the ban on bent bananas:Guide to the best euromythsLittle Englanders don\'t want the EU to have any jurisdiction over internal affairs in the UK. They don\'t want EU working directives, they don\'t want the European Court of Human Rights (which is separate institution to the EU in any case) and they don\'t want big, bad Brussels telling us what to do and spending all our money.The socialists have a completely different problem with the EU. They don\'t read the Daily Mail or the Daily Express and they don\'t have a problem with immigration; their problem is that the EU is committed to Free Markets and is a bulwark of Capitalism. By guaranteeing freedom of movement of Capital, the EU effectively prevents member states from implementing the controls required to enforce confiscatory taxation and other anti-business policies. The flagbearer for socialist opposition to the EU was the late Tony Benn, erstwhile mentor to the new Labour (UK Political Party) leader Jeremy Corbyn:[I am against] the Treaty of Rome which entrenches laissez faire as its philosophy and chooses bureaucracy as its administrative method.- Tony Benn - WikiquoteThese factions have formed an uneasy alliance ahead of the EU membership referendum:EU referendum: New \'exit\' group launches its campaign - BBC NewsIn addition to the above there is also a libertarian faction, whose objection to the EU is a consequence of its bureaucratic, centralised nature and the lack of accountable democracy. They like the idea of a free trade area but don\'t want the additional burden of government the EU brings with it, and their case for leaving is based on the questionable assumption that they would be able to negotiate a free trade deal with the remainder of the union.

S' If Labour wants to lure back voters who deserted them for UKIP in 2015, they need to be honest with themselves about why it happened. It isn\'t sufficient to say that people voted for UKIP because Labour were perceived as Tory-lite, because in many ways UKIP are more Tory than the Tories themselves. Rather, erstwhile Labour supporters opted for UKIP because they were not part of the political establishment, and that is where Corbyn has some credentials of his own to offer. Although he has been in parliament since 1983 he is also known as a maverick, and he may be able to trade on that to woo disaffected voters.In terms of actual policy, the obvious principle that Corbyn personally shares with UKIP is opposition to the EU. Like his mentor Tony Benn before him, Corbyn sees the EU as a capitalist stitch-up, guaranteeing freedom of movement for capital and thereby limiting the ability of individual member state governments to control it. His problem is that the majority of the Parliamentary Labour Party support Britain\'s membership of the EU, and he would need to conduct something of a purge before he could get the party to adopt a pro-exit policy.Beyond the EU issue, it\'s difficult to see any ideological common ground. Despite historical claims to be a libertarian party, UKIP\'s manifesto is essentially ultra-conservative in nature. Their opposition to the EU is based not on concerns about capital but the opposite; imposition of social frameworks and unrestrained movement of people. So even though Corbyn and UKIP might both want to leave the EU, they do so for different reasons. Corbyn has no common ground with the xenophobic, Daily Mail-reading contingent of UKIP\'s support at all.It would also be a grave mistake to assume that "working class" voters are inclined to support left-wing politicians and that therefore Corbyn has their support sewn up. Thatcher had strong support in that demographic in the eighties and the left/right paradigm is not important; it is more valuable to be seen as a conviction politician who stands up for their values whatever they may be. That was Farage\'s appeal and, in that sense, personalities are more important than policies when trying to win those votes back.'

I've sunbathed in February and I've known days in August when the temperature never made it into double figures (Celsius). The warmest day I've ever had in years of hill-walking in the Lake District was in March 2012.It means that average temperature and rainfall charts are not much help when determining what kind of weather you are likely to encounter. Obviously, it tends to be colder in winter than in summer but the main difference is the length of the days. Days in December are depressingly short, whereas it doesn't get dark for long in mid-summer at all.All that said, my personal observation is that late September and early October is one of the most settled times of year. I would be more confident about organising an outdoor event then than in August, for example.

Both these extremes and everything in between can be heard in just about every European country. In some countries, such as Germany, more people lean more toward the former view, in others such as Hungary, more people lean toward the latter.Europe is not one nation and so part of what makes the situation so difficult is that many people are inclined to see it all as somebody else\'s problem. When refugees are trying to smuggle themselves into the UK from Calais, residents of the south of England are likely to say "they\'re quite safe in France, why don\'t they just stay there". Similarly, European leaders point to the fact that the refugees arrive via Turkey and argue that they can\'t claim asylum in their country if they have already made it to safety in Turkey.It\'s a region-wide problem but there isn\'t a region-wide authority capable of dealing with it.

That particular arms race has already been decided.This is what a police officer looks like where I live (see below). Outside of high-profile targets such as airports, the most lethal weapon he carries is a can of pepper spray. The important difference is that in Britain policing occurs by consent, not by force. That's liberty right there.Now as it happens, a policeman was killed on Merseyside yesterday, 5th October 2015. That area includes Liverpool, one of Britain's largest cities and not known for its conformity or allegiance to the government in Westminster, yet David Phillips was the first police officer in 34 years to be murdered while on duty there. And he wasn't shot, he was run over by someone in a stolen car. The last school shooting in Britain was in 1996, following which handguns were outlawed. No child has been shot dead at school since and for the most part parents feel safe dropping their kids off in the morning. That's what liberty feels like, and the price of it is that ordinary citizens don't get to walk around with a gun.You see, the freedom to own and carry a gun could be considered one form of liberty, but freedom from the fear of all the other nutjobs who are carrying them is another.

One definition of a "fair" price is that it accurately reflects supply and demand in a free market, another is that all the people who want or need the product can afford it, another still is that it rewards labour at a sustainable level. It\'s difficult to make any of those judgements with regard to slavery. The whole point about selling a slave is that it does not represent a free and fair transaction conducted to benefit all parties. There is a massive element of violence and coercion that cannot be disregarded.Notwithstanding that rather important issue, the market value of a slave is highly dependent on some fairly volatile variables. Supply is determined by how many slaves you can capture and subjugate, while demand is determined by the willingness of employers to purchase slave labour. Even if slavery were to be legal, that does not make it morally acceptable. Slave owners are likely to attract intense criticism, potentially reducing demand significantly.Alternatively you could calculate the nominal "fair" value of slave labour by considering the cost of paying someone minimum wage for a few years to perform the same work and subtracting their living expenses (risk of illness, death, mutiny or escape would mean you wouldn\'t account for more than a few years). This may be where the figure of $20k comes from.However, it turns out that real slave market prices are much lower than this. The most high-profile open trading of slaves in 2015 is conducted by ISIS, who do enough of it to have established a tariff [1]. Children under nine years old cost $165, adolescent girls go for about $124 and women over 40 cost as little as $41. Their duties are not typically agricultural in nature, but in a free market they do tend to attract higher wages than farm labouring. In that context, $100 for an agricultural labourer sounds like an upper limit.[1] Islamic State sex slave price list authentic, $165 for a child - UN '

S" No, because it has been demonstrated in the last few years that the Euro project is flawed.In principle a single currency is a good idea because it reduces transaction costs across the trading zone and eliminates the uncertainty that exchange rate fluctuations cause. Such benefits were indeed observed following the introduction of the Euro.However, if the currency is shared by several countries which implement varying fiscal policies, problems can arise. Without a fiscal union or federal structure which oversees fiscal policy, divergent policies will exert pressure on the monetary union. Weak spots in the economy will emerge which cannot be addressed within the confines of a single currency. While the Greek economy in particular may have benefited from a currency devaluation in recent years, this could not happen due to their membership of the Euro.The concept of the Euro is sound but the implementation is poor and the safeguards to keep member states' fiscal policy in line are not properly enforced."

S' The whole point about democracy is that you are free to propose or oppose any ideas you like, within reason. Communist ideas do exist in western countries but they are not especially popular anymore due to the unpleasant consequences of attempts to implement them in reality.Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels began work on The Communist Manifesto in the Chetham Library in Manchester, UK and it was first published in London in 1848. Neither man was persecuted, arrested or otherwise harassed. The publication has remained freely available ever since and numerous political parties have promoted its content.The path to communism envisaged by Marx, and later developed by Lenin and Trotsky among others, requires a transitional phase of socialism in which the state owns all means of production. Historically this has typically resulted in authoritarian, one-party states in which democracy and free speech were suppressed, and production itself became inefficient and misdirected. Collectivization of agriculture at a national level has a particularly bad track record, too often resulting in famine and starvation. And crucially, the final stage of the transition from socialism to true communism has never occurred in practice, meaning that communism remains a utopian ideal rather than an achievable outcome.The broad consensus of democratic political systems has therefore been to deliver social democracies based on capitalism, featuring state intervention to redistribute wealth where necessary. Few people in such societies see communism as a viable alternative to this model and so their governments voice opposition to communist revolutionaries who threaten democracy elsewhere.'

S' I\'m sure Corbyn would consider capital controls to be completely unnecessary, but they would ultimately become inevitable under any government led by him.Corbyn imagines that he could fund all of his spending plans just by cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion. This is extremely naive. Tax rises would be necessary and naturally they would be targeted at the wealthiest. These tax rises would almost certainly raise no additional revenue because the extra received from those who were willing to pay would be cancelled out by those opting to take their money and leave. As soon as this became clear, Corbyn would announce capital controls due to the "exceptional circumstances".Rupert points out in his answer that capital controls are illegal under EU law. However, there will be a referendum on the UK\'s continuing membership of the EU before the next general election and the "no" vote is looking alarmingly strong. It is possible that the UK could already be on its way out of the EU before Corbyn could take office.An EU exit is currently opposed by the majority of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) and Corbyn says he will not campaign for an exit because he respects that opinion [1]. His personal view, though, is that the EU is a capitalist project and he is somewhat equivocal about it [2]. His mentor Tony Benn was a consistent Eurosceptic [3][4] and it is not out of the question that a new look PLP aligned more with Corbyn\'s politics would be in favour of exit. I would posit therefore that a Corbyn government would impose capital controls in the medium term, even if they had to leave the EU in order to do so.[1] Jeremy Corbyn confirms that he will not campaign for Britain to leave the EU[2] Jeremy Corbyn: Our EU debate has been hijacked  here\'s what we should be talking about[3] Jeremy Corbyns world: his friends, supporters, mentors and influences[4] Tony Benn: The case against the EU is its lack of Democracy'

S" There's a very broad generalisation which says that snowboarders suffer more minor injuries but skiers' injuries are often more serious. Snowboarders fall over frequently, especially beginners, but they are at less risk of lower body injuries because everything is fixed in place. Consequently, snowboarders tend to fracture wrists, ribs and collar bones. In contrast, skiers are at risk of twisting their knees, which can easily result in a painful injury followed by surgery, months of rehabilitation and a joint which never fully recovers. Competent skiers also tend to travel faster than their equivalent snowboarders so, if they do hit something, the impact tends to be greater.However, simply falling over isn't the whole story. Intermediate skiers are more inclined to stay within the relative safety of marked runs, while snowboarders are drawn earlier to the soft, deep powdery snow away from the piste. The risks of going off-piste are manyfold; avalanche, concealed rocks, tree wells, unmarked cliffs, etc. These dangers are more life-threatening than the incidents you're likely to get mixed up in on the groomers.Of course, advanced skiers are heading off-piste in ever greater numbers too, as the popularity of powder skis testifies, and any activity which involves sliding down an icy mountain is unavoidably hazardous whether you are on one or two planks.

S' A small proportion of British people think that "Muslims are taking over Britain" but there is no evidence to support this fear.

In rural areas, you\'d be hard pressed to find any Muslims at all.The parliamentary discussion is a waste of time, and serves only to illustrate the folly of triggering an automatic debate if a petition raises a pre-determined number of signatures.

S' Freeway traffic:Auto pilot works amazingly well. It\'s shocking and delightful. You\'ll certainly get to experience a "holy shit !" moment.I wasn\'t sure how well it would work it night, though I tried it and it worked like a charm. You can see how it\'s tracking the lanes on the display - blue lines indicate it\'s tracking the lanes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...This is the advertised use case, and they nailed it right. It\'s not a gimmick. It\'s the real deal.I\'ve heard of other drivers also saying they can just hop onto a freeway and it just works.It\'s also a bit awkward in ways - for instance if you look at this video, you\'ll see how the driver is just sitting and chilling while the car drives, and he\'s finally trying out the web browser.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Reddit\'s Tesla forum has a number of other videos showing it in action:Official Autopilot v7.0 Video Thread  /r/teslamotorsThere has been talk about self driving cars and how we\'d all be texting, taking pictures and watching YouTube videos while our cars drive themselves - I wrote a longer and older post about this here. It\'s one thing to speculate and think about it, though experiencing autopilot was one of those moments where I felt that future is completely certain.Stop and go traffic:Traffic assisted cruise control ( i.e. accelerating and braking the car with traffic moving and stopping constantly ) works extremely well and always has since it went live. With autopilot it became better because it now automatically resumes.Self steering works well if they turns aren\'t sharp, since it follows lane markings to guide itself, it\'s not great at adjusting speed for sharp turns.So stick to the car only controlling speed and steer manually if the roads are sharp and curvy.Indicator driven lane changes:I\'ve only tried to use the indicators for lane switching on a freeway, and they work well. You are still supposed to scan your blind spot.Automated parallel parking / automated garage parking:I have not been able to get this feature to work. I\'ve seen videos of it working, but I\'ve never seen the parking indicator trigger.I\'m probably doing something wrong.Also, the review mentioning that this worked in June is highly suspect - parallel parking only came out in version 7.0 and garage parking is still not out ( it\'s a 7.1 feature ).TLDR: Tesla Autopilot works extremely well on freeways, which is what it was designed to do. Beyond that, just remember it\'s mainly reliant on being able to see lanes, the car ahead of you and to some extent GPS and sideways sensors.It\'s not advertised as or meant to be a full self driving car, though it\'s a wonderful taste of that future today. I am terribly afraid though that some people will use it thinking it\'s magic and not read about and understand it\'s limitations.What are the cases it doesn\'t handle well ?Well, there are a few corner cases I\'ve experienced where it\'s better to go manual though they are relatively predictable and well defined.If someone trying a sudden change into your lane, it\'s not as fast to react as a human. So be watchful for this. Thankfully with the car accelerating, braking and steering for you, this gives you a lot of cycles to pay attention to jerks who are try to squeeze into your lane.The auto pilot seems to have disabled vanilla traffic assisted cruise control and in particular taken away the ability to enable it at low speeds ( which was great for stop and go traffic ). You could tap on the cruise control stick, and it would just maintain it\'s speed. I hope this is something they bring back. Now you enable TACC by enabling auto pilot then overpowering the steering which is awkward.Sometimes autopilot keeps track of your previous speed when you disabled autopilot, vs. trying to turn it on with the current speed. So if you had it on in a 55mph freeway, and disabled it, and then moved to a 65mph zone, it enables auto pilot at what your previous speed was set to be.If you are on a street with weak markings, and there are no other cars, it can end up playing pacman. In general, be careful when markings are weak. ( I had this happen to me on a deserted offramp ). I wish there was also some learning or early warning that was based on Tesla using it\'s mapping data based on routes you drive often around where lines are weak.This is a nitpick, though I get the impression it tends to keep constant distance from the lane line to your left rather than aligning itself in the middle of two lanes.Thanks Tesla for making such an awesome feature.'

S" I thought the movie had great acting, but there were a few very jarring parts of the movie that didn't click for me.The movie tries to show Jobs life and relationships evolve, and how some characters are so tightly linked to him. While this is fine, the problem with the depiction is it's very unrealistic to have those people around for 3 separate product launches.The movie shows Jobs as being really good at being a huge jerk and not showing him as being much of a product guy either.There is no continuity around how he was married and had kids by the later sequences of the movie.It doesn't tell a story of the products, just that they are somehow magically built and ready to be demoed.It doesn't cover the comeback years of Apple at all, namely the iPod and iPhone years. Or for that matter Pixar. I would have expected at least some of that.If it were a pure work of fiction, I might have liked this movie - the acting is really quite good. I expected authenticity, and I did not feel I got that, which is what broke it for me.I really enjoyed The Social Network, and felt if this movie had a similar vibe, I'd like it too.However, I came out feeling disappointed."

S" I ate at Sukiyabashi Jiro Roppongi about a month ago. A lot of the other answers have narrated the experience of dining there already, so I'll try to answer some of the questions around what makes it stand out from other sushi experiences.Was it the best sushi I ever had ?Yes, but there is some fine print, so read on.Was it worth the 5X-6X cost multiplier of what you can get at Tsujki Market ?It's questionable. If you are optimizing absolute best quality rather than value for money yes, otherwise go stand in line at the fish market. It was 25% better than the other famed fish market places for a very significant price premium. If you want the absolute best and want to indulge in it, go for it.There are courses elsewhere which can be better than Jiro. The Uni for example was great, but I've had better Uni elsewhere. There are some sushi preparations which are just different. Quality of fish can be a wildcard, so it's not the be all, end all of experiencing good sushi.What made it better ?The quality of the fish for many courses was phenomenal, the tuna and shrimp for example.In some of the other courses, it was the preparation that just made them melt in your mouth. The horse mackerel and eel feel into this category.Was the egg as good as it was hyped up to be?Absolutely. It was unlike any other Tamago I've eaten at a sushi restaurant. Unlike most other sushi restaurants, it's more of a cake than a gross looking chunk out of an omelette. This was one of the courses that definitely made Jiro stand out from the Tsujiki sushi restaurants.Would I do it again ?Given that I don't live there, I'd happily include it in a visit to Tokyo given how infrequent I'd expect those to be, If I were a local, I'd probably visit it at most once a year for a special occasion. It's also a lot of food, so it's not a practical everyday meal.In short, it was great, but it wasn't value for money considering how good some of the other sushi options in Japan are.Was it as good as the primary Sukiyabashi Jiro location ?I don't know but given how easy it is to get reservations for it, it being about 1/3rd cheaper and it has 2 vs. 3 stars, I'd imagine it's slightly though not by much. Of course, I can't say for sure.Given that it was already in the deeper end of the cost - quality spectrumin terms of pushing the limits of how much one would pay for sushi, at least from my perspective it fell in the same mental category of super high end sushi.It's not the best option if you care about value for money, though a great place to indulge in rarely."

S' I was a former paying Spotify user and happy with it for a few years, but after trying out Google Play Music for a couple of months, I made the switch for the following reasons:The basics - streaming, offline support, recommendations, playlist management, content selection, multi platform support are all there in both products.Great support for Nexus Player and Chromecast. It\'s very nice for broadcasting music when at a friends place.A web interface which does not use Flash, has keyboard shortcuts and is much faster. I use a Linux desktop and so this is important to me.I had more problems with Spotify and Bluetooth as compared to Google Play music. I did not diagnose why this was the case, and instead opted to go for the app which did work for me.Using Google Play Music also improves your YouTube and Google Now recommendations from what I can make out. I like how the subscription fee also disables ads for a lot of YouTube music.I have an Android tablet at home, and it\'s got slightly better voice integration as compared to Spotify, in terms of being able to say "play [song] by [artist] on Google Play Music".The fee is 8$, 2$ less than Spotify, which is a nice to have, but not a key driver for me.I find the social aspect of Spotify creepy and distracting more so than helpful. I want my music listening to be private and never really discovered any meaningful amount of good music through their social activity feed.Spotify had a really simple way to star songs, but they made it more complicated. You could just like star song and have it added to an auto generated playlist, but then they changed it so that you needed to add it to a playlist, and they still kept the old starred playlist - one extra level of friction for what was a simple function I liked.Note that I work at Google, but as of this writing do not directly or indirectly work on the Google products mentioned above, and made the switch based by accidentally trying out Play Music to get a YouTube Music key subscription, and finding out it was better for my needs.The only Spotify feature I really miss is the native app. Arguably, if I were not on Linux desktop for development most of the day, I might have been less likely to switch over.'

In his past, he was a star of a superhero blockbuster movie - Birdman. However, in present day times he is struggling to stay relevant as a broadway actor.I think it's a good movie that focussed on a situation many of us can relate to: when times are rough, one can't help but remember past laurels, but at the same time come to terms with how things have somehow changed.Keaton is the perfect actor to play the part given his past performance as Batman in the 80's.

It is sometimes up to the audience to figure out what is going on.The casting has been done really well, and the acting is superb. Michael Keaton and Emma Stone in particular absolutely blew me away by their moving performances in the film.

Sure once in a while you might see a skip list here and there or learn a particular implementation relies on a particular balanced tree, but for the most part getting your hands dirty with complex in core structures is rare.On the other hand, persistent data structures one encounters are usually now far, far more demanding than anything you see in a textbook, and usually also far less explained. There are concurrency, reliability and memory hierarchy friendliness issues that are very complex, and rarely captured well in textbooks.There might be some overlap with some of this material and a databases or OS class, but in those classes the algorithmic analysis is not that rigorous.So if I could have one feature request for the next book, it would be that there be a lot more additional material focused on persistent data structures.Update on what to remove:If I had to pick I'd vote for sorting networks, linear programming, FFT and computational geometry."

S" The short version is that purely technical interviews sometimes miss important details about the overall package that a person is.I've encountered my share of very technically sharp people I've seen who aren't team players or aren't motivated. They can do very well in pure programming interviews but may not end up being superstars on the job. You can also have engineers who have approaches that are great complements to what you are doing, or just don't align with a teams philosophy.At the same time, there are people who might come across as good or average in interviews, but end up becoming foundational pillars of teams they work on by getting things done, being extremely productive, leading and being role models for others.Often this leads you to really learning more people skills, attitude and tenacity - which in addition to technical skills are absolutely vital for success in a team development environment.While coding and algorithmic questions are the bread and butter of my engineering interviews, I also budget a little bit of time to ask candidates open ended technical questions which often provide a much deeper insight into how candidates think, how they apply themselves, how they communicate and justify their decisions, what they are good at, how they approach teamwork, and so on.While I don't believe in or support purely behavioral interviews ( and personally tend to see it as a red flag because they tend to signal hiring for pure soft skills ), they are a logical extension of a similar train of thought, i.e. once you have a reading about someone as an engineer, you want to complement that with a reading of their soft skills.Finally, there is another reason that you might get a non technical interview: you've aced the technical interviews to the point your non technical interview really is a complete sell pitch."

S" The majority of non-European migrants are from SE Asia, particularly China, India, and Vietnam. Very few immigrants from these countries arrived between 1901 and around 1975, when Australia had the (now-embarrassing) White Australia Policy, making immigration very difficult for non-English-speaking people.The Chinese have a long history in Australia, beginning with the 1850s gold rush, and a significant population was in place prior to the enactment of the dreaded White Australia policy. After the policy was lifted, many Chinese came to Australia to flee political persecution, to study, or simply to pursue a better life.There was a small population of Indians in Australia prior to the White Australia policy being enacted, but since its lifting, there has been a large immigration, primarily amongst professionals seeking employment opportunities.The majority of Vietnamese came as refugees in the late '70s and early '80s, and are well-known for being hard workers who frequently establish and operate thriving small businesses."

S' There are vast differences, most of which flow from the primary difference, which is that yields are much lower in Australia. Therefore, making money from Australian property is primarily via capital growth (appreciation), rather than via rental income. It is nearly impossible to buy property in Australia that will be cashflow-positive at the outset; yields in capital cities are frequently only in the range of 3%, where in comparable areas in the USA they\'d be over 10%. My experience has been that yields are around 4 times higher in the United States, as a % yield, to comparable properties in Australia. (For comparable demographics, type of property, etc.)As a consequence, in Australia, having a tenant is merely "an inconvenience that one tolerates for the sake of subsidising the cost of holding the asset whilst waiting for growth", but rental income is not the main game.Some other differences:Laws are much, much more tenant-friendly in Australia, and if landlords breach them, they\'ll get eaten alive at Tribunal. So it requires some significant expertise to learn all the appropriate laws, and ensure every notice is served at the appropriate time. Hence, that brings me to my next point...Nearly all landlords outsource the management of property in Australia to professional third parties. Property management is usually done by real estate agents in Australia; nearly every real estate agency has two arms: "selling" and "leasing". (Though some agencies specialise in one or the other.)Payment of rent is electronic; it\'s usually not even possible to pay rent via any other method in Australia. The idea of a landlord visiting a tenant to collect rent in cash is an entirely foreign concept to Australian landlords. (In fact, without special arrangements in place, it would be illegal in Australia.)Because Australian landlords tend to be more "hands off", they feel no need to restrict themselves to a particular area, and frequently an Australian property investor will own properties in multiple states across the country, for diversification.In Australia, tenancies can begin and end on any day of the month. Rent is also paid weekly, or fortnightly (every two weeks), rather than monthly. The amount payable by a tenant is calculated down to the day when they leave. So a tenant can move in on the 16th, and move out a year and 8 days later on the 23rd, and they\'ll pay rent for 374 days exactly.Bonds (security deposits) are held by an independent third party, not the landlord, in Australia. Typically, the whole amount is returned to the tenant at the end of the tenancy. If the landlord wants some withheld, they either have to secure the agreement of the tenant, or make their case at Tribunal.The allocation of expenses between landlord and tenant is pretty much the same in each country.American landlords discuss which gun is most suited for rent collecting. O.o I guarantee that this is not something that would ever cross the mind of an Australian property investor.Australian tradesmen are much more expensive than their American counterparts. Repairs can be more costly here. On the flipside, we have negligible black mold issues, and almost nobody has (or requires) central heating, so there are very few possible very expensive, "invasive" repairs that are likely in Australia.'

S' Many people don\'t, but I think it\'s a potentially expensive mistake. For most people, buying a home is the largest transaction they\'re ever going to participate in, and if it "goes wrong", they stand to lose everything.I\'ve bought and sold more a few dozen times; I still get legal advice on every single contract (and mortgage documents). I\'ve seen a lot who\'ve been burned; it\'s actually not that uncommon for people to find themselves in unconditional contracts to purchase a property that they can\'t finance, for example, and they lose a hefty deposit and possibly get sued for damages as well.For the sake of a few hundred bucks, are you willing to risk making a mistake that could cost you everything that you have?'

S' In general terms, estoppel is a common law doctrine that precludes somebody - who is said to be "estopped" - from denying a legal truth, in the course of a legal action.The truth can be words or conduct, and express or implied.There are many categories of estoppel, but to say much more is to get into issues that vary according to jurisdiction.A simple example that would be applicable to most common law jurisdictions (by different names) is a reliance-based estoppel, which generally has the elements that one party is induced to believe that a certain state of affairs exists, and relies on that to their detriment. The other party is then estopped from denying that the state of affairs exists.For example, imagine that the terms of a lease of a building have been agreed - price, duration, and other essential terms - but the contractual formalities have not yet been finalised. The landlord says "feel free to do a fit-out and move in while the lease is being drawn up". Despite a requirement (in many jurisdictions) that a lease has to be evidenced in writing to be binding, the landlord would be estopped from later denying that a lease agreement existed, on the basis that they had led the other party to believe that the agreement was finalised, and that a written lease was forthcoming. In reliance on that belief (created by the landlord), the other party had expended money improving the premises and moving in (detriment).'

I don\'t think I can even recall seeing any libertarians in the media, though some people like politician Cory Bernardi may go close to being identified as a conservative. (Though even he is significantly left of many US-style conservatives, e.g. supporting universal healthcare.) And note that he\'s considered an extremist in Australia.As David Stewart correctly identifies, people who home school in Australia are far more likely to be from the opposite end of the political spectrum, and home school because they want to "unschool" or employ some other more flexible educational experience.'

A good rule of thumb is to add the specific topic, and perhaps a topic that goes up on level of abstraction.So if your topic is specifically about growing Granny Smith apples, you would add Granny Smith (apple), and it would also be reasonable to add Apples (fruit), but it would probably be going too far to also add Fruit.My understanding is that a question with both Apples (fruit) and Granny Smith (apple) has the same or more distribution than a question that only has Apples (fruit), not less, if that's your question."

S' There was relatively little resistance. Even those who were initially opposed to the laws largely saw it as an inconvenience that they were experiencing for the greater good. Australia places a very high cultural value on "mateship", which could be described as "treating your fellow citizens as friends ("mates") unless you have some reason not to, and doing the right thing by your friends, even if it\'s detrimental to yourself". The gun buyback was sold to the public as something that was painful, but necessary, and consistent with the value we place on mateship.The largest resistance was from farmers, though even they grudgingly accepted that it was necessary. In time, even they have admitted that:they benefitted from the new laws (due to significant reduction in suicides amongst farmers), it really didn\'t negatively affect their farming operations as much as anticipated, and it significantly benefitted their mates, outweighing any cost to them.Even amongst those organisations that were insistent that the sky would fall in, these laws are now entrenched in our culture, and you virtually never hear any complaints. Even a whisper of loosening the laws, however, is met with widespread and vehement condemnation; it\'s politically a non-starter.We view the situation in the United States as absolute vindication that we\'ve done the right thing. There is far more complaint from American gun advocates about what we\'ve done, than there is from Australians. Even Australian sporting shooters and farmers are largely on-side with our laws. There simply is no significant dissent or objection. We love our safe environment, and we\'re not going to be told by American gun advocates that we\'re oppressed or wrong, just because we don\'t sacrifice over 300 lives a day on the altar of a principle. We choose, happily, not to do that.'

It is much more helpful to figure out whether the OP intended A or B, then make it clear in the question wording, and if they meant A, and somebody wants to answer B, then they can post another question.That\'s the only way that you can end up with the optimal outcome: one page for question A, with answers to question A, and one page for question B, with answers to question B.Doing it the other way is likely to result in an unsatisfactory mess of "question A/B" with some answers relating to A and some answers relating to B, plus a page for "clear A" and a page for "clear B", and no way for the pages to be merged to sort out the mess.The only way to address this situation consistent with Quora\'s core mission - make the page more helpful for people who want answers to the question - is to clarify before answering.[One notable point: ideally, Quora would have the ability not only to merge questions, but also to separate them, and then "sort" the answers onto the split pages A and B.

S' Primarily, it\'s helpful against corrosion. It\'s also lower maintenance; polishing needs to be done several times a year to keep looking good, whereas paint stays looking good for longer (dirt "washes off"). The reduced expense from this lower maintenance outweighs the cost incurred by the additional weight.US WWII military aircraft stopped being painted in late 1943 because the speed gain of lower weight was judged more important than the camouflage benefits of a paint scheme. So the B-29 changed its appearance from this:To this:Corrosion doesn\'t appear to have been a big consideration, which is logical: the planning timeframes when you\'re a military force fighting a war are much shorter than those for a commercial airline with life cycle cost concerns. The military (at least during wartime) are less concerned with how the aircraft will be corroding in a decade, than how fast they can get it off the production line and into action, and then how fast it will fly, right now. There\'s also the reality that many wartime aircraft, at least in a WWII context, are unlikely to survive for long enough for corrosion to be an issue.Sources:Painting versus Polishing of Airplane Exterior SurfacesThe U.S. Army Air Forces Strips Its Planes of Paint | Defense Media Network'

S' I confess that this is a really hot topic for me; it touches on a whole lot of issues. I\'ll try to separate them out.It\'s often engaged in by parents who already have a lot of one gender, and want a child of the other gender. I hate to see parents saying this, because it tells the earlier children that they were somehow a "mistake", or "not what we wanted". It doesn\'t matter how many times you say "Of course I love my boys, I just wanted a girl", it\'s got to feel shitty being one of the boys of parents who openly proclaim how much they wanted a girl. I also see families where the much-wanted girl (it\'s usually a girl in the west) is treated very differently than her older brothers, and is smothered with attention, appears in Mum\'s facebook more than her siblings, gets lots of new clothes, gets special outings with Mum, etc. To me, that\'s not OK. Every child should be valued and treated equally (as far as possible, e.g. children with special needs obviously will almost certainly need to receive additional time and attention).It places expectations on unborn children. Children should not be born to fulfill a role for their parents; their only job should be to be who they are. The much-wanted daughter of such parents is born with a job to fulfill her mother\'s fantasies about mother-daughter activities. What if it turns out that she\'s a huge tomboy, and hates all the activities that her mother dreams of doing with her? She should be allowed the freedom to be a tomboy, without there being a sense that she\'s "failed" her mother.It values people for gender rather than their inherent worth as human beings, and is the same thinking that ultimately leads to mass infanticide of baby girls in some countries. Is it a morally comparable activity? No, of course not, I\'m not suggesting that. But I am suggesting that it\'s prompted by the same underlying thinking: the idea that somebody\'s worth is determined by their gender, or that their gender is the most important thing about them.It reeks of an entitlement mentality that\'s gob-smacking. Children are not a commodity that you "order" because that\'s what kind of child you want to parent. Parenting is the most selfless thing you\'re ever supposed to do; it\'s not about you.It\'s ungrateful. If you are in a relationship and the two of you have the gift of being able to have children without assistance, then there are many unpartnered people, and gay and infertile couples, who envy you enormously. Using limited reproductive services for what I consider frivolous and misguided purposes offends me at a very deep level, and I imagine is offensive to those many people who rely on these services, and would be grateful for any child.In life, I try very hard not to be judgmental. Rightly or wrongly, I just experience a deep failure when it comes to this topic. :)'

S' Because saying "Islam is to blame for terrorism" doesn\'t get us anywhere.I don\'t believe that it\'s true, but let\'s pretend that it is. Many people seem to want to hear this, but sensible leaders and thoughtful citizens don\'t come out and say it because they recognise that it doesn\'t move things forward.Let\'s do a thought experiment. The UN comes out with a statement: "Islam is a bad religion, and the driver for terrorism."What next?Over 1.5 billion people, or around 25% of the planet\'s population, are Muslim.Do we kill them all? Obviously that\'s not viable. (And clearly morally repugnant.)Do we force them to renounce their religion? I don\'t even know how that\'s possible. Do we introduce global laws illegalising the Quran, mosques, etc.? Is that the kind of world we want to live in, anyway?If we can\'t kill or convert them all, and Islamic terrorism is a problem that we want to address, can we do it without the 24%+ of the planet\'s population who are Muslim and not terrorists?We just can\'t. Further, how do you think the 24%+ are going to react to being labelled as complicit? Do you think that\'s going to motivate them to want to join with the remaining 75% of the planet to tackle Islamic terrorism, or is it more likely to drive them to extremism? Human nature tells me that it\'s the latter; if 75% of the planet is telling me I\'m a "bad person", then I\'m going to stick with the people who accept me. Even if some of them are brutes. We need to make it feel safe, and not a betrayal of their religion, for the 24%+ to ally themselves with non-Muslims.The only way to tackle the scourge of Islamic terrorism is to do it alongside those Muslims who share the western world\'s concerns. We can\'t do that by "tarring all Muslims with the same brush", we do it by focusing our criticisms on the terrorism that is our primary and shared concern.Let us also not forget that Muslims are overwhelmingly the victims of terrorism. Western outrage is what we primarily hear, but the victims of terrorism are nearly all Muslim. Muslims are at least as concerned about these behaviours as progressive western non-Muslims, but they don\'t have the freedom of speech that we are privileged to enjoy, and so we don\'t hear it. But don\'t doubt for a moment that the vast majority of Muslims are as repulsed by these behaviours as the rest of the world. Their (apparent) silence should not be misinterpreted as complicity.If we manage to successfully eliminate terrorism side-by-side with our Muslim sisters and brothers, enough goodwill will have been generated for us to have the much more difficult conversations about reforming and modernising Islam.But right now, I\'m sorry, I won\'t engage in a philosophical discussion about whether Islam is a net positive or negative, because it\'s entirely counter-productive.'

S' I\'ve noticed that heterosexual women often find the opposite: that they\'re more socially comfortable with gay men than gay women. I think it\'s the combination of "I don\'t view them as a potential sex partner" with "They may view me as a potential sex partner" - putting aside that this is often false :) - that makes people uncomfortable.We feel a real discomfort when we perceive that somebody else may be sexually attracted to us, and there\'s no possibility that the feeling will be returned. I remember that when I was a teenager, I found out that a male friend had a crush on me, and I didn\'t feel the same way about him. It made me feel revulsion, and I found it hard to even stay friends with him. Sure, there was a lot of immaturity at play in that situation, but I think it stems from the same discomfort: it doesn\'t feel good to suspect or know that somebody else thinks about getting jiggy with you, when that idea is unappealing to you.'

S' A young man has been dating a young woman he really likes for a few months, and she invites him to meet her parents. They go to her parents\' home for dinner, and he is introduced to the family pet Rover, an old Labrador.Everything is going well and he\'s enjoying the meal, when all of a sudden, the guy is overcome with a need to fart. Oh gosh, what is he going to do? He\'s trying to impress her parents!He suppresses it for a while, but the pressure is growing. Eventually, he decides he has to relieve it a bit, and ever so carefully, he releases just a little bit of gas.About 15 seconds later, his girlfriend\'s father pauses mid-sentence to bark "Rover!" at the dog, and continues speaking. Rover is lying in the corner of the room, between the boyfriend and the father, and fortunately, it seems that the father thinks that it\'s Rover who\'s farting.A few minutes later, the boyfriend risks releasing a little bit more.Another 15 seconds or so after that, as the odour spreads, the father again hollers: "Rover!"Conversation continues, and the boyfriend is mightily relieved that he seems to have gotten away with releasing some of the pressure in his bowels, without embarrassing himself in front of his girlfriend\'s parents.Eventually he risks releasing all of the remaining pressure, as quietly as he can.A few seconds later, the father roars: "For God\'s sake, Rover, move out of the way before this boy shits all over you!"'

S" Because multipurpose aircraft aren't optimised for the mission, so your chance of mission success is lower.Aircraft that can carry a lot of cargo are awesome for transporting equipment into a new theatre; but they tend to be heavy and noisy, so they're not so good for covertly dropping special forces behind enemy lines.Aircraft that can carry a huge payload of air-to-ground weapons are fantastic for destroying bunkers and caves, but generally lack the manoeuvrability to be able to defend themselves against air-to-air threats.Aircraft with huge suites of electronic sensors are optimised for surveillance and intelligence gathering, but sacrifice stealth and payload.You need the right tool for the right job.Obviously, when you have less money to spend, or other limitations such as space available to land on a carrier etc., you specialise less and might select a compromise. An example would be the F/A-18 being used for both strike (bombing) and air-to-air missions (amongst others); it's not the best in class in either of those roles, but it performs both of them reasonably well."

S' It may serve to limit rightsAt present, our common law system says that we have a right to do anything that\'s not legislated against, guided by some fundamental traditions of common law systems, e.g. the influence of liberalism and its emphasis on freedom and equality.Once we attempt to codify this and say that we have rights A, B, and C, it may imply that unstated D, which was a right in a broad common law interpretation, is no longer a right, or is not as important a right. People could argue "well, if the people wanted D to be a right, they would have said so!", but it\'s quite difficult for any list of rights to be exhaustive, without appearing overly broad.Rights will become politicisedIf a proposed bill of rights is to be the subject of a referendum, then politics will influence what the list is, and some politically unpopular groups may be sacrificed in the name of political expediency. For example, it\'s sad but true that recognising rights for groups such as indigenous Australians and asylum seekers would be politically challenging; it\'d be hard to obtain the requisite double majority. Subsequently, if a referendum passes that doesn\'t explicitly mention, say, asylum seekers, the Government could argue in Court, quite persuasively, that the people didn\'t intend for asylum seekers to have rights, because otherwise they would have said so. (See point 1 above.)InflexibilityEven if we could thoroughly codify the rights we want right now, and it wasn\'t subject to political considerations, the problem with a constitutionally-embedded document is that it\'s extremely resistant to change in response to changing mores. If it had been done 50 years ago, it almost certainly would have ignored gay rights, for example. And it\'s likely that rights will widen further in time. It\'s much easier to change legislation, and for judges to adapt the common law, than to change a constitution.America\'s 7th Amendment, for example, gives parties a right to trial by jury for all civil matters worth more than $20. 150 years ago, that may have been reasonable, but it hasn\'t been changed. You can still insist on a jury trial for a $20 dispute! What an enormous waste of human and court resources, as a result of the inflexibility of incorporating it into the constitution.This concern can be addressed by having a legislative, rather than constitutional, bill of rights, and I\'m "less opposed" to a legislative bill of rights than a constitutional one. Victoria, the ACT, and England have taken this path.AbsolutismPresently, Australian courts balance common law rights against other factors, such as the rights of other individuals, statutory law, common law precedents, international covenants, etc. One of the negatives, in my view, of a constitutional bill of rights is that these things then tend to be viewed as absolutes. For example, in Australia, one person\'s freedom of speech is balanced against a whole plethora of other considerations, such as the rights of minorities to feel safe in their environment, and I think courts generally balance these competing concerns very well. If we had the Westboro Baptist Church in Australia, I\'m positive we\'d find a way to stop them protesting soldiers\' funerals - and I think that\'s a good thing. When you give people, such as the Westboro Baptist Church, a constitutional right, it tends to be viewed as an absolute, and isn\'t weighed against competing rights. I find that absurd.This concern could also be addressed, by explicitly stating in the bill of rights that rights are always to be considered in a broad context, and balanced against competing rights.In summary, I think that our Courts are actually quite good at protecting our rights, and they do so without having to consider the political consequences. I believe that any constitutional amendment would be highly political, and a legislative bill of rights only slightly less so, and that as a political process, either of these routes would deliver a scope of rights that would be narrower than is presently enjoyed.'

S' Operation Mikado is not analogous to killing a downed pilot on the ground, because Operation Mikado was an attack designed to reduce the capacity of the Argentinians to engaged in air battle, i.e. had a valid military objective. A downed pilot has no plane with which to engage in air combat, and the targeting of such a pilot is not a legitimate military objective.A pilot descending in a parachute is already hors de combat (taken out of the battle). Military personnel are only ever able, under the laws of armed conflict, to use the minimum force necessary to render an enemy combatant hors de combat, so the application of any force against a pilot descending in a parachute would be unlawful. (Precluding some exceptional circumstance such as the pilot using a weapon and attempting to engage the enemy during descent.)You\'re right that there\'s no guarantee the pilot will surrender upon landing; the pilot must be given that opportunity, but is "fair game" if any hostile act is attempted. Protocol 1 to the Geneva Convention, Article 42, section 2 states: Upon reaching the ground in territory controlled by an adverse Party, a person who has parachuted from an aircraft in distress shall be given an opportunity to surrender before being made the object of attack, unless it is apparent that he is engaging in a hostile act.'

S' I\'m going to start with some examples of people experiencing racial / ethnic identity crises, where the race that they "are" is different from the race that other people recognise them as, or where their long-established self-identification turns out to be based on falsehood. Marlon Brown: black man with albinismSome black people with albinism report finding it difficult to feel fully accepted in black culture, such as Marlon Brown: Confessions of an African-American albinoPale offspring of biracial parents: the Aylmer twinsThe offspring of biracial parents can have a wide spectrum of skin colour, as evidenced by these twin sisters, Lucy and Maria Aylmer:I haven\'t seen an article where these two talk about their racial identity, but I imagine that Lucy would not be readily recognised as "black" nor Maria as "white", even though they are twins, and that must be quite confusing. Meet the biracial twins no one believes are sistersWayne Joseph, black man with no African ancestryWayne Joseph and his family have always identified as black - or more particularly, as "coloured" in their Louisiana ancestral home. In 2003, at age 50, he had his DNA tested and was astonished to find that he had 0% African ancestry. Test Suggests \'Black\' Man Is Really NotSandy McCutcheon, not Jewish after allAustralian journalist Sandy McCutcheon grew up believing he was adopted from WWII refugee camps, and that he was Jewish. He embraced his Jewish identity, and even won a Jewish playwriting award. When he was nearly 50 years old, he discovered that he was, in fact, the offspring of two Anglo-New-Zealanders, with no known Jewish ancestry. He struggled enormously with his identity, and did quite a bit of media about it in the mid-90s. (Sadly, I can\'t find any recordings of the radio or TV interviews online, I recall that they were very good.) Australian Story - ArchivesShould people be able to change race?With regards to the second part of your question, fortunately, it makes no sense within an Australian context; we have no "legal recognition" of race with respect to individuals. Race is not recorded on any identity card or record.We are sometimes asked if we\'re Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) or non-ATSI, because there are some programs specific to ATSI people. We\'re also asked what race or ethnicity we self-identify as for census purposes.But the Australian government has no official position on what race each individual is, and I find the idea that any other system is viable quite bizarre. In countries where individuals are identified as having a particular race, who decides it? I can\'t imagine any scheme other than self-identification making any sense, therefore it seems that changing ethnicity or race should be as simple as saying "I no longer identify as race A, I am race B", and filling out any future paperwork consistently with that.Lest anybody thinks otherwise, I am not suggesting people should be obliged to do this, of course. Race only makes sense as self-identification, so people should not be obliged to be racially classified due to DNA or any factor other than self-identification.(Which means that lots of white people - certainly in Australian culture - tick "Horn of Africa" or something on the Census because they can and they think it\'s funny. Which makes a nonsense of the whole thing, and which is why the Australian government does its utmost to avoid the whole issue. The only division relevant to the Australian government is the approximately 2% of of the population who identify as ATSI, and "the rest". Those who claim ATSI identity usually establish it with reference to tribal and other community members.)'

S' I\'ve found the Quoracast, and having skype sessions with Quora employees due to my former role as an admin, a fascinating experiment, and have discovered that one forms an idea of what people\'s voices sound like, and that it rarely matches the reality.Marc Bodnick, Michelle Roses, Marcus Geduld, David Urquhart, and Jonathan Brill, all sounded very different than I\'d expected. None of them sounded better or worse, just different. I\'m sure this phenomenon has been studied, but my amateur take is that we create a "voice" for each personality as one of many ways of distinguishing individual personalities, and organising them in our memories. (I have no idea why we create one voice as opposed to another, though.)It\'s quite a jarring experience, at first, and my initial reaction was: "oh my gosh, I really don\'t know that person that I thought I knew", or "I don\'t know this person!", but that\'s just a response to the conflict between your presumed voice and their actual voice. :) What I have found, though, is that by listening for a while, my "mental model" of a person rapidly adjusts to incorporate the actual voice, and I no longer experience that dissonance. In fact, as time passes, it\'s increasingly difficult to recreate the voice that I thought they had; it\'s being substituted in my memory by their actual voice.Interestingly, Christine Leigh Langtree is perhaps the only Quoran that I can think of, who sounds almost exactly as I\'d imagined. :) I do wonder if the fact that we\'re both Queenslanders is relevant. i.e. If your imagination makes a closer "guess" for people with accents that you\'re more familiar with.

S" The Australian Defence Force is well-equipped, highly-trained, and well-regarded internationally.Can it prevent anybody ever mounting a successful one-off attack against the Australian mainland?Well, given the size of our country, that's an extremely high bar to set. But even then, I think we're better-equipped to prevent even that, than most Australians would credit. Our intelligence and surveillance systems are extremely capable, and it's highly unlikely that we could be surprised. (Pearl Harbor-type surprise attacks are, in the context of the contemporary first world, nearly impossible.) Even if such an attack were mounted, it would rapidly be repelled, though there very well may be civilian casualties.Could the Australian Defence Force resist an invading force?On its own, it would put up a better resistance than most Australians would probably credit, but more significantly, it can keep Australian citizens safe until our American allies turn up, and with the help of the US, yes, Australia can retain its sovereignty. (Many think the UK might come to our help due to historical ties. As an aside, we don't interoperate with the UK to anywhere near the same extent as the US, and UK forces are optimised for operating in entirely different climates and political environments, with very different equipment and operating procedures. The UK is very Europe-oriented with equipment and procedures, whereas Australia is far more US-oriented. We very naturally and readily form a cohesive fighting force with our US allies. The UK are still very friendly and may send logistical support, or help with specialised things such as intelligence, but are unlikely, in my opinion, to send significant fighting forces.)The whole reason we went to Iraq (for example) was to maintain our strong alliance with the United States in the event of just such a threat, rather than because we had a direct strategic interest in what happened in Iraq. The US alliance is extremely strong, and the primary contributor to Australia's extremely high capacity to defend itself."

Ironically, I find the Indian government\'s actions in seeking to censor this documentary reflect far more negatively on India than this documentary did (which I have seen).By attempting to ban this documentary, the government is suggesting that:"Reputation" and "honour" are tangible things that it\'s acceptable to defendThe actions of third parties can damage reputation and honourDefending reputation and honour thus demand that such actions by third parties be prohibitedIsn\'t this precisely the thinking that the vast majority of people - including the vast majority of Indians, I presume - are fighting? Isn\'t this precisely the logic underlying honour killings, and the "she deserved it for being out at night with an unrelated male" responses to rape?India is a thriving, robust, liberal democracy. It can withstand close scrutiny, and to be defensive and try to shut down conversation and examination is highly unbecoming. It is action more suited to a dictatorial regime than the liberal democracy that is modern India.I felt the documentary actually presented India, overall, very positively. Despicable crimes such as this one also happen in western countries, and documentaries are made about those, too. We don\'t watch such documentaries and assume this is an indictment of the whole society or country; we look at such incidents as an opportunity to examine where the "weak spots" are in our society, and try to figure out ways how to strengthen them.

S' I\'ve spent the majority of my career negotiating, and training and managing negotiators. I\'ve been involved with thousands of small, medium, and large negotiations.I\'ve seen a few different types of people be effective. Some are the brash, loud and obnoxious types -- like Donald Trump. Yet, others are the opposite and totally quiet, shy, and respectful. Yet, all top negotiators share a few important characteristics. They are able to: Focus on the outcome Ask the right questionsListen and understand motivationExecute and appear confident and credible Handle failure and riskBe resilient and not give upA lot of people dislike negotiation because they view it as adversarial. Which sometimes it is. However, top negotiators are not trying to win an argument. Their goal is not to prove a point. Their goal is to get what they want. Top negotiators are able to focus on the outcome. They know what they want, and they go into a negotiation prepared to get it. Bad negotiators are ill prepared, and often don\'t even know what they want. If you don\'t know what you want, you aren\'t going to get it! And just as important as knowing exactly what you want, is understanding what the other side wants. Top negotiators know how to ask the right questions. Typically a negotiation boils down to a few main points and top negotiators understand the most important factors. They listen very carefully, and are able to figure out what matters to the other person. A lot of people have mentioned that top negotiators are good listeners, and certainly that is part of it. However, asking the right questions, is just as important. Listening to understand what the other side needs is vital. It\'s important to understand what the other side wants, not just what they say they want. I\'ve also found listening for when a story changes to be key.Top negotiators do their research. And they are often flexible -- seeing many ways to "win" in a situation. Whether this is their Best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) or just multiple ways to do a deal. They typically aren\'t overly rigid or too focused on changing somebodys mind. That is hard and exhausting. And it rarely works. Great negotiators focus on how they can get what they want and how they can give other people what they want.Also, to be a top negotiator you need to be authentic and believable. The other side needs to feel confident that you are credible and you can execute. Again, I\'ve seen a lot of different styles succeed. Some people, like Trump, appear larger than life and love to brag about how good they are. Yet, I\'ve also seen people negotiate multi- million dollar deals by telling the other side how terrible they are at negotiating. Many top negotiators have different negotiating styles - but they all are confident and credible. It\'s hard to be a great negotiator if the other side doesn\'t trust you can deliver. It\'s also impossible to be a great negotiator without hearing no, and putting yourself out there. You are going to get rejected. So, top negotiators are comfortable with risk and ok handling rejection. Top negotiators are persistent, and don\'t quit when it gets tough or when they are told "no." The more adversarial and draining the negotiation, the more likely the party with more stamina will win. Zero-sum negotiation is often a game of chicken. And better negotiators dont cave, or quit. Perseverance pays off. For most people, at a certain point, the goal is just to come to a conclusion and move on. But, for the most effective negotiators, the goal is always to get the best deal possible given all the circumstances. Impatient take it or leave it negotiating rarely achieves the optimal outcome.Finally, most negotiations involve a degree of gamesmanship and top negotiators have honed pattern recognition and are comfortable with negotiation strategies.

S' There are a few times when ruthlessness is the best course of action.ruthless (roothls)adj.Having no compassion or pity; merciless: ruthless cruelty; ruthless opportunism. 1. When someone is out to harm you, or your company, be ruthless. Whether it be a competitor, a colleague, an employee. If you are dealing with someone who is a bad faith negotiator, and is looking to hurt you, then you have to protect yourself by whatever means necessary. Contrary to what some people believe, it\'s not necessary to start out with this attitude. Many of the most brutal and ruthless people start out kind, and compassionate until someone gives them a reason to distrust. In the words of Al Capone:Don\'t mistake my kindness for weakness. I am kind to everyone, but when someone is unkind to me, weak is not what you are going to remember about me. When you are dealing with someone who doesn\'t have your best interest in mind, be ruthless in defending against attack. Be careful though not to be vindictive or petty. Protect yourself and move on. It doesn\'t do any good to hold onto silly or meaningless grudges. 2. When you are dealing with someone who doesn\'t respond to anything else.There are people who don\'t respond to anything less. I\'ve dealt with these types of people, and tried to reason with them, and tried to be nice. Compassion did not work. The nicer and more reasonable I was, the more they took advantage of me, and worse, continued to think they could trample all over me. These people will respect you only when you are ruthless. To them, compassion looks like weakness and they only respond to unbridled shows of strength. So give it to them. 3. When you have waged war, and are all in. There are times in business, and battles when it is more compassionate to be ruthless. If a company is in a massive death spiral or something drastic needs to be done, it is best to be ruthless and do it quickly. One of the Maxims of Napoleon Bonaparte: "If you wage war, do it energetically and with severity. This is the only way to make it shorter and consequently less inhuman."In these times of crisis, it\'s necessary to be ruthless in the productive sense. Work when others sleep, be ruthless in winning. It\'s not necessary, or healthy, to always be at war. Balance, compassion, and sleep are a good thing. However, once war is upon you, be ruthless to end it quickly and in your favor.'

S" I've been embarrassingly impatient. I've yelled at customer service reps at Ikea for being too slow, etc. At the time, I was working my butt off and couldn't enjoy the time I wasn't working because I was so impatient and rude everywhere I went. I honked at cars, and cursed slow drivers on the road. I was miserable, and so were the people around me. They could just feel my impatience. It was that bad. Recently, however, I went to the dentist and while I was checking in, the receptionist asked me how I was doing. I smiled, said good, grabbed a magazine, and sat down. Then I asked her how her day was going. She smiled at me and said I was the first person to come in all day who didn't come in complaining about the traffic and impatiently asking if they were next. So, what steps can you take to practice patience? Here are a few things that worked for me:1. Cut out toxic peopleThe people you hang around have a tremendous impact on your life. It's really hard to overstate how much being around jerks will make you impatient. Toxic people who constantly e-mail, text, guilt, and berate you will zap all of your patience. Stay away from them. Spend your time with people who make you feel better. Life will be much simpler, and you'll be much more calm and patient when you are surrounded by good people who have your best interests in mind. If you can't completely cut out toxic life-complicators (family, managers, or co-workers, etc.), don't stoop to their level. Ignore toxic people as much as possible. Don't waste time gossiping or fighting. Don't talk badly about these people behind their back, it usually gets back to them, and will create drama. All of this will zap your energy, and leave you with much less patience for everything else in your life. 2. Release expectationsDon't expect too much from other people. Everyone reacts differently to situations, and you never know what the other person is thinking. It's easy to get impatient by assuming other people can read your mind. Don't do it. Also just because you do things a certain way, don't expect other people to do things the way you do. Don't get impatient with people for being themselves. Similarly, don't promise what you can't deliver. It's really hard to go back on your word. And once you've promised something, it creates stress. The more you've promised and the more expectations on your shoulders, the more impatient you are likely to be. Say no more often and only commit to what you can really handle, and to what you want to do. You only have so much energy. Use it wisely. You are likely to feel impatient when you feel you have more to do, than time to do it. 3. Don't run late or procrastinateIt's easy to feel impatient when you are running late. Time never goes slower than when you need to be somewhere and are stuck in traffic. 30 seconds can seem like half an hour. So, if you are known to run late, make an effort to be on time or early. Similarly, don't procrastinate. If there is something that you have to do, just get it over with. It causes impatience when you feel like there is something hanging over your head. The calm and relaxed mind is a more patient mind, so prioritize what you need to do, and do the most important things first thing. Waiting till the last minute to do something important causes unnecessary stress, and impatience."

S" Ahhh, the chicken and the egg. How do two-sided marketplaces get people to start using their services? They require both buyers and sellers. And to get people to really start using their service, they need to start with one first: the sellers.A marketplace will succeed only if it has inventory. Buyers and sellers are required on both sides to monetize, but the side that is needed first is the side that provides the goods. For example, all the buyers in the world aren't meaningful if there isn't anything to sell. Similarly, a dating website is only as good as the potential dates on the site. People will start using the service, only after a tremendous amount of work has been done on the backend making the service scalable and launch ready. Again, inventory is king. Fancy marketing, slick websites, or any of that jazz doesn't really mean much. They won't get people to start using a service. Execution is everything in a marketplace. Just look at craigslist. People started using it because it works. For people to start using the service not only does it need to work, but it needs to be easy to sign up and fast to provide value. The fewer steps, the better. These marketplaces get people to start using their service because they make it easy and seamless for people to sell what they want to sell and to buy what they already want to buy. Effective marketplaces get people to start use their services because they provide tangible and compelling benefits: Convenience, Cost, and Consistency:Sellers will start to use a platform if they can be convinced it is a convenient and fast way for them to find buyers. Marketing is difficult, and sellers will start to use a platform that has good SEO, reach, and effectively brings them buyers.By exploiting economics of scale. It is more efficient for these platforms to operate, so sellers can focus on the goods they are providing, not the operations. Buyers will start to use the service when it's easier for them to find what they are looking for by using the marketplace, than by other means. Again, this requires sellers to begin with. Buyers and sellers will only start to use the service if they feel it is legitimate and provides security. They need to financially trust the system. To get sellers started on the system the service needs to have the backend financial system figured out.For example, sellers typically have a pain point accepting money -- It's surprisingly expensive and complicated to deal with accepting, processing and dealing with fraud associated with ACH, credit, cash, check and all the other payment options available today. Fraud and the fees associated with accepting payment can easily wipe out many sellers. The marketplace will need to have this figured out to get sellers to feel comfortable using it. Companies like, Square and PayPal exist solely to help sellers get paid. Payment is such an enormous market, with lots of pain points, that the biggest companies in the valley are taking it on: Apple Pay - Apple, Google Wallet, and Facebook Payments.Buyers also need to feel secure with the system before they will start using it, so the service needs to make buyers comfortable. For instance, I've bought and sold thousands of dollars of camera equipment from Amazon Marketplace. Would I be willing to send $1,400 to D-Solutions in South Korea for a product I've been eyeing??? Nope. However, there is a chance I'll buy this from Amazon Marketplace."

S' The best topic for a 10 minute presentation will depend on your audience. If success in real estate is: location, location, location. Success in presentations is: audience, audience, audience. The best topics will impact your audience in a positive way. To figure out the best topic, you need to answer a few questions first. Specifically:Who are you speaking to? Don\'t focus on topics for yourself, but rather what will be most useful for the audience. Tailor your presentation to them. Research ahead of time as much as you can, as to who you will be presenting to. Cut out anything that doesn\'t directly pertain to them. For example, if you are giving a talk on black holes, the topic for a general audience will be high-level and basic: "What is a black hole?" If you are giving a talk to astrophysics your talk will be more specific and topical, like: "Is there a black hole at the center of every galaxy?"People have short attention spans, even during a 10 minute presentation. Stick only to what is important to your specific audience.Why are you giving the presentation? People are busy and the fact that they are showing up to your presentation shows that there is interest in your topic. Why are they coming to hear you speak? Why do they care? Give the audience what they came for. People have showed up for a reason. Keep that in mind. Tell the audience clearly why you are there, and why you are excited to speak to them. People respond to passion and conviction. Speak to what is relevant to them, and tell them why you believe it is relevant for them. If you\'ve been given an open mic, and really don\'t know what to speak about, people are generally interested in topics like the following:Making money & getting richImproving productivity & saving timeBecoming more attractive & well likedInteresting stories & antidotes about celebrities (depending upon your audience can be entertainers, politicians, sports stars, etc)What now? Wrap it up!End the presentation with summarizing what you said, why you said it, and what they should do next. Don\'t ramble on. After you\'ve told the audience what they need to know, give them a clear call to action. Be positive and proactive. Don\'t assume that your audience is automatically going to know what to do with what you told them. And don\'t just hope that they will remember to do it later. Be prepared to get what you want. Make the call to action easy, immediate, and seamless.Finally, if the presentation is 10 minutes. Stick to 10 minutes, or less. People are busy. Respect your audience\'s time. Start the presentation promptly, and plan to end a bit early. Watch your pacing throughout the presentation and make sure you aren\'t spending too much time on any one point. By giving yourself a buffer, you\'ll avoid rushing towards the end. If you have a few minutes left, let the audience know you will stick around if they have any follow up questions or comments. Don\'t run late, it can inconvenience your audience and leave people feeling rushed and anxious -- not the feelings you want the audience to feel leaving your presentation. Leave people wanting more and always end on a high note.'

S' It\'s perfectly acceptable and correct to write either. People will know what you are trying to say. The goal in professional communication is to be understood. "Please find the attached file," is more common, but not the only correct phrase. For example, if adding additional text, like: "you requested," it would sound more natural to use the later, "Please find attached the file you requested." It\'s always good to remove unnecesary words, so when in doubt cut "the" and just write, "please find attached" or PFA. "Attached" is the correct word for e-mail & electronic communication. Enclosed, is more frequently associated with physical mail. Finally, "find" has more than one meaning, and using it doesn\'t necessarily mean that something is lost. "Please find attached" is letting the reader know that something is attached in the email. And yes, this can be necessary, as some people really do miss that little paperclip icon denoting an attachment.'

S' The 2016 election is still over a year away, but Hilary Clinton is going to win it. The only way she loses at this point is if something catastrophic goes wrong for her, most likely with her health. And she\'s looking pretty healthy. There are no more skeletons to be found in her closet-- only glorious red, white, and blue pantsuits. American politics is like "A Game of Thrones" and the strongest house will sit atop the Iron Thrown. It is true that Hilary Clinton is not very well liked and many of the american people don\'t trust her. But House Clinton is too fierce. They are battle trained, prepared, and their troops are in it to win it. At all costs. They have the money, experience, and political strength to defeat everyone else in the race right now. Clinton knows that "Winter is Coming" and like House Stark, is incredibly prepared. While I am excited for the first woman president, her gender has very little to do with her chances in 2016. She is just the best candidate in this race. The competition is simply too far behind. The Democratic nomination is hers. Joe Biden recently announced that it was too late for him to get in, likely because he knew that he had little chance of securing the nomination. Biden is very well liked by the President, the beltway, and the populace, but Clinton is just too far ahead. House Clinton has secured the funding, talent, and support. Biden, and his advisors, knew the fight would be ugly, bruising, and he wouldn\'t win it. Biden, like House Tully has the motto of Family, Duty, Honor and family came first. Bernie Sanders is showing some strength and doing a lot better than expected. However, he is no Barack Obama. He\'ll likely win a few early states, but he is not a plausible alternative to Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Sanders, like House Arryn, is the principled house-- seated in a small castle, which is located far, far away at the top of a remote mountain. The Republican nomination is another story all together. Jeb Bush is arguably still the Republican front runner, and House Bush -- Like House Lannister, is formidable. "They always pay their debts." Jeb, like Tommen, has money, advisors, and he seems like a decent guy. However, he doesn\'t have the charisma, or the necessary fire in his belly. Tyrion Lannister, says it best: He was a sweet boy, not like his brother. Bush has more money than anyone else, but he\'s spending it just as quickly, and he\'s not gaining ground. Donald Trump is making a play, and he appears strong, but ultimately has no plan to govern and will be defeated by the stronger Houses. Like House Baratheon\'s credo: "Ours Is The Fury" Trump is able to rouse passion, but the Fury needs to be tempered to win. Ben Carson, from House Martel, is too far from Westeros to seriously take on the stronger Houses. He has separated siamese twins, "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken." But it\'s nearly impossible for someone without any elected political experience to actually win the presidency of the United States in 2016. Carly Florina, has the "Fire and Blood" of the Targareons. She, like the Mother of Dragons, is an excellent marketer, public speaker, and debater. On the grand stage, she shines. And brightly. Yet, she too, is an inexperienced leader and the results of her actions fail to live up to her grand and bold promises. Marco Rubio, from the House Tyrell is, "Growing Strong" and has a real shot of securing the Republican nomination. He strikes a pragmatic balance, and like House Tyrell, is politically savvy in a strategic and understated way. By taking the slow and steady course, and raising under the radar, he very well may be the next to face, and fall, to House Clinton in 2016.'

S' Dylan Thomas published this powerful poem in 1951, and wrote these words as his father was going blind. The dying of the light is a reference to darkness -- actually losing sight -- and ultimately failing health, and the painful inevitability of death. Yet, this poem is not gentle or dark. It is a strong invocation for us to live boldly and to fight. It implores us to not just "go gentle into that good night," but to rage against it. Even at the end of life, when "grave men" are near death, the poem instructs us to burn with life.The poem\'s meaning is life affirming. It urges us to live life to the fullest and to never surrender. "Rage rage rage against the dying of the light" -- push back and against blindness, illness, death, and whatever is forcing you back in life. Thomas is writing about his Fathers loss of sight and impending sickness, and in turn, his own relationship with his father and his own death. Dylan Thomas\'s father died in 1952, and tragically, Dylan Thomas himself died just a year later in in 1953. Dylan Thomas was a heavy drinker and he suffered from alcoholism, dying at just 39. History has Dylan Thomas dying from drink. But a new theory suggests that his death was caused by his doctor who, "failed to diagnose pneumonia and treated poet for alcoholic condition."Yet, even while Thomas and his Father were struggling with their health, this poem assents the value of fighting for life. Thomas argues, as Shakespeare did in Henry VI Part I, that we all need to: "Fight till the last gasp" (1.3.127). Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night is, therefore not just about fighting against the blindness of the old man or Thomas\'s own battles, but about all of us raging against our weaknesses, and the gradual loss of our fire, passions, and life. The poem is written as a Villanelle and the title itself uses adjective (gentle) as adverb (gently), making the latent meaning even more present. Photo of Thomas as a young man.

S' First impressions are important, so take some time to hone your introduction, and then tweak it depending upon the audience. This question is often asked in interviews, so prepare for it. Nailing the introduction will break the ice and improve your chances of moving to the next steps. I\'ve interviewed hundreds of people over the years, and often I can tell in the first few minutes if I\'m interested in hiring a person. Your main goals in the introduction are fairly simple. You need to show that you:Have the ability and desire to do the jobWill fit into the company culture, and be good to work withWon\'t quit shortly after being hired First off, you want to keep your introduction positive and simple. Don\'t ramble on for too long. For instance, highlight aspects of your career, interests, accomplishments, education, and / or hobbies that match that of the company and interviewer. Focus on what is directly relevant to the job you are interviewing for and for the person interviewing you. Keep in mind an interview is generally not about how smart you are, or how great of a person you are. It is about your fit for a specific job. Most interviewers don\'t have long attention spans, so use this time wisely. Don\'t assume that your interviewer has read your resume. However, don\'t simply recite your resume verbatim to your interviewer. Sadly many interviewers are not that well prepared, and don\'t let that sidetrack you. Also, keep in mind who is interviewing you. If it\'s an introductory HR interview, keep things high-level. Even if you are interviewing for a highly technical job, chances are the recruiter will leave that part of the interviewing process to the subject matter expert. If you are having trouble with this question, re-frame it to: "Why are you are a great fit for this position?" This is your time to craft your message, so don\'t bring up anything negative! Even if you are reaching for the job, give an introduction that shows why you deserve it. Never talk yourself out of a job or hedge in the first few minutes. For example:If you are a recent college graduate, highlight internships, hobbies, or college projects that relate to the job. If you are making a career switch, highlight your positive attributes and transferable skills.If you are looking to make the move to management, highlight specific examples of how you have motivated and led teams.For a few examples of other things to avoid: see Mira Zaslove\'s answer to What are some of the biggest red flags in an interviewee?If you have been referred to the company by a current employee, it is appropriate to mention that they got you excited about the position. Also, if you know anyone else at the company, and feel that they will give you a positive recommendation, let the interviewer know. Finally, if you are feeling uncomfortable and having a hard time reading what the interviewer wants, it\'s fair to ask them. For instance, say something along the lines of: "I have 10 years of work experience, and want to make sure I best answer your questions. Can you tell me what you would like me to focus on?"'

Carol, Michonne, and Daryl are major badasses. And so are Maggie and Glen. In the midst of the apocalypse, I would trust any one of them with my life. But the biggest badass on TWD has got to be our main man, Rick Grimes. (Source: The Walking Dead, Rick Grimes)Rick is the leader, and ultimate badass among badasses. He is alert, loyal, and brutal. Rick does what needs to be done to survive. Not only has Rick survived, but he has also kept his son, and his daughter alive. He is a single father, taking care of a baby and a teenage son -- which makes him a pretty big ass-kicker by itself. Not to mention, fighting off hoards of walkers, wolves, and deprived humans who want to kill him, and his group, at every step. Anyone who has tried to take care of a baby in the best of circumstances, knows how loud, hungry, and utterly dependent they are. Sure, Rick has had plenty of help taking care of his kids -- which only further shows how much of a badass he is. Rick is capable with a gun, a knife, and oh yeah, in the Season 4 finale, he literally tore open a mans throat with his teeth.'

S" The most badass life hack I know is: Anchor high, and don't give up. The more you ask for, the more you get. It's as simple as that.  I've seen people get badass salaries, girlfriends, and lives by believing they deserve it. What you get in life isn't really what you deserve, but what you think you deserve. If you look at people who are successful they start by aiming high and by not accepting a low offer. People generally aren't going to give you more than what you ask for. So when people ask what you want, aim high. Very high. Project high standards for yourself and the way you deserve to be treated. So, if you want to make $100k, don't settle for less than $100k. When recruiters ask you how much you want to make start by saying $130-$150k, and negotiate from there. Don't even consider or apply for a job that doesn't offer $100k. They say the job will only pay $80k, then walk. Don't accept less than you want. Similarly, if you are looking to purchase a car or a house, start by aiming low. Throw out an initial offer less than the one you want to pay. Yes, you want to leave room for negotiation, but you also want to anchor the value low. Have conviction, project confidence, and anchor to your advantage. An excellent example of anchoring is given in Thinking, Fast and Slow by: Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize. He showed the power of random anchors in some pretty unusual ways. For example:German judges with an average of more than fifteen years of experience on the bench first read a description of a woman who had been caught shoplifting, then rolled a pair of dice that were loaded so every roll resulted in either a 3 or a 9. As soon as the dice came to a stop, the judges were asked whether they would sentence the woman to a term in prison greater or lesser, in months, than the number showing on the dice. Finally, the judges were instructed to specify the exact prison sentence they would give to the shoplifter. On average, those who had rolled a 9 said they would sentence her to 8 months; those who rolled a 3 said they would sentence her to 5 months; the anchoring effect was 50%.Crazy thing about this outcome of the die roll? It had absolutely no relationship to how the fake shoplifter should be sentenced. Similar studies have been done across many disciples and people, and the results are amazing. The initial numbers mentioned in discussions-- even if they are not relevant to the discussion at hand!-- are powerful, so use this badass power to your advantage."

Unlike the Republican Primary race, the Democratic Primary race is clearly between 2 people. I watched the debate, and thought both Clinton and Sanders performed well, and further solidified their base. As the graphic below shows, reviews on who won are mixed. But interestingly, they are mixed in a pretty similar way: Editors largely believed Clinton was the clear and decisive winner, whereas viewer polls on these same sites, largely believed Sanders won by a significant margin.(Source: Facebook) Sanders also picked up a lot of Google traffic, as compared to Clinton. However, I don't view that as meaningful. Hillary Clinton is one of the most recognizable people in America, and she's effectively been running for President for the last decade.

S' We Dare you To Expense This!How much money people spend when they are out to eat is influenced by psychology. Restaurants use all kind of tricks and psychology to manipulate spending and eating habits, including the following: Would You Like a Drink With That?The manipulation starts right when you walk in. Ever notice how restaurants love to suggest you wait at the bar until your table is ready and ask if you would like to order a drink before you\'ve even looked at the food menu? Similarly, would you like still or carbonated water? has become a common question. Although most customers would be fine with tap water, this suggestion increases the chances that they will purchase bottled water instead.Drinks are, in many cases, what keeps a restaurant profitable. Not only are people more likely to order and eat more when they are drinking, the margins on alcoholic beverages typically far outweigh everything else-- except for maybe that water. The markup on beer and wine is typically in the 200% - 500% range. Waiters can be difficult to track down, but few forget to ask if you\'d like a drink refill. Tao Las Vegas, which brought in over $64 million last year, is the top-grossing restaurant in the US. Alcohol sales accounted for approximately 75% percent of the revenue.Now that you\'ve got your drink, the manipulation continues when the menu arrives. The Anchor Decoy & Comparison ShoppingManipulative menus often include a crazy expensive product that is not really intended to sell. Rather, it\'s used to make other items look like "deals" by comparison. The anchor decoy gets people to spend more money, by NOT buying it. For instance, the Zillion Dollar Lobster Frittata (yes, it is actually called that!) at Normas at the Parker Meridien hotel in New York City. The regular frittata, made with a pound lobster, includes 1 oz of Sevruga caviar for $100, while the "Norma Dares You to Expense This" higher-rollers version, comes with 10 oz for $1,000. Notice too, how Norma\'s doesn\'t include the $ sign, or any decimals. To minimize price sensitivity, manipulative menus, omit $ signs, or any mention of cents. Anchor decoys are often highlighted by being placed in prime space, or in different colors, where the eye naturally goes. At Norma\'s, one can assume the items in orange are their high margin offerings. (Source: Full Menu @ Norma\'s restaurant at the parkermeridien.com)Manipulative Menu Mix - Bracketing & BundlingMenus bracket prices by including a small, medium, and large option. In this scenario, margins are often highest and profit maximized for the option that looks the cheapest.Bundling is also used by fast food chains and Michelin Star restaurants alike. Whether ordering a "combo meal" or a "price fixe chef\'s tasting menu," the bundle looks cheaper and more people are attracted to these options. Customers believe they are getting a deal, yet they are often just spending more for items they don\'t really want. Restaurants also often bundle their high profitability items with those of lower profitability to increase overall margins. Most restaurants sell a mix of items, and not all dishes are created equally. Industry convention groups them into:Stars: popular items with high marginsPlow Horses: popular items with low marginsDogs: unpopular items with low marginsPuzzles: unpopular items with high marginsExamples of stars include pizzas, pastas, and omelets, which are popular, and relatively cheap to make, especially in bulk. Examples of plow horses include steaks, which are popular, but also relatively expensive for a restaurant to procure high quality product.Restaurants manipulate patrons by packaging stars and plow horses with puzzles. Puzzles are also often placed at the top of the page, or highlighted in different colors, or highlighted in a really fancy box, like the anchor decoy.'

S" I've managed teams of talented, smart, and hardworking people as they grew into adulthood. Following are a some truths that many find uncomfortable. Mistakes and failure are a good thingWe all hate to make mistakes and it sucks to fail. However, experience is the best way to learn, and we learn more from our mistakes than our successes. Transitioning into adulthood means making the most of experiences. And mistakes and failure are less dangerous than complacency and playing it safe. The most successful members of my team were not the ones who never made a mistake. They were the people who pushed themselves, had the courage to try new things and were comfortable falling, and getting back up. Something that surprised me as a hiring manager, and surprises me still: people who made the most money, were not the ones who were the smartest, the most talented, or even most valuable -- they were the ones who asked for the most. Sure, by asking for a lot, they were often told no. But, eventually someone said yes. Similarly, the people who have been the most successful five years out, were not always perfect. They were the ones who made mistakes, learned from them, and adjusted. A member of my team and good friend is now making great money, loving his work and his life, when just 16 months ago his fingernails were falling out due to stress. He had a few temporary setbacks, but always kept pushing forward, and never saw himself as a failure. He didn't quit when the going got tough, or try to avoid his problems. He was mature, acted like an adult, and faced issues head on, and was able to achieve what very few people believed he could. Had he never taken these chances, or tried to avoid issues, he would not be as happy or as successful. People will let you down, and that is OKBeing an adult, often means accepting that not everything is about you. People will be awesome and then they will betray you. It's natural to take people's actions and attitudes personally. But it's usually not about you. It's about them. People do what they believe is in their best interest, at the time.People aren't always rational. It's easy to waste a lot of time and energy worrying about what other people think, and it's completely futile. I saw people growing into adults as they began to understand that most things in life are not personal. People are pretty self-centered and that is ok. Understanding this makes understanding others a lot easier. Similarly, I saw people maturing when they stopped worrying about what other people were doing or thinking. Transitioning into adulthood, often means taking responsibility for your own actions and doing things for yourself and not for others. It also means not expecting too much of others. You will outgrow people, and a painful truth is that you are often better off without some of your friends."

Einstein was passionate about the violin, and though Einstein often had a distant and strained relationship with his family, he shared a love music, and left his violin as a legacy.Einstein's remarkable talent was for physics, but he played the violin throughout his life, and he was a good musician with an intuitive understanding of the music. Playing the violin brought him happiness, and he bequeathed his last violin (said to be nicknamed Lina), to his grandson, Bernhard Caesar Einstein. Bernhard Caesar, also became a physicist and shared Albert's ability to play the violin. Bernhard Caeser's second son, Paul Michael Einstein, also inherited the love of playing and Bernhard Caesar gave him Albert's violin. Today Paul Michael lives in the South of France, where he is a professional composer and violinist. In 2004, Paul Michael performed Mozarts Sonata in E Minor, Alberts favorite piece, at the German Physical Societys celebration of Albert Einsteins 125th birthday. All of Einstein's descendants didn't inherit Einstein's IQ, but many of them did inherit his love of music and ability to play the violin. And, studies have indicated that Musicians Are Probably Smarter Than The Rest Of Us."

S' Dealing with co-workers you personally dislike is, sadly, a common problem. The best way to deal with it, is to ignore them, and keep doing your job. Focus on yourself, and your work rather than on people you dislike.A few things to keep in mind:1. Don\'t talk badly about themYou may not like somebody, but chances are someone likes them or they would not have been hired. Also, the person you dislike, may be good at their job. Some workplaces are more political than others, and some cultures can seem like popularity contests, but stay out of it! Talking bad about someone you dislike will only make you look worse, and distract from your work. If you are in management (or want to be), you should be viewed as unbiased, and able to get along with people on the team. Finally, people talk and likely it will get back to the person, which will only make your problem worse. 2. Don\'t engage with them If you can, move teams. Spend as little time with them as possible. It\'s exhausting and draining trying to work with someone you dislike, so minimize your interactions. As a manager, a surprising amount of my time was spent dealing with co-workers who did not like each other for petty reasons. It\'s not a productive use of time or energy, especially if you loop in other people. So, be professional and if you must trash talk, do it with non-coworkers outside of work. However, if this person crosses the line, engages in harassing or abusive behavior, or is seriously impeding your ability to do your job, document the issues. Go to HR -- keep your personal dislike out of it, and focus on the behavior that is hurting the company. Is this someone you dislike, or someone who is a true liability to the company?3. Trick yourself into working well with themIf you cannot get away from the person, and need to make it work, try to trick yourself.There are a few ways you can do this. One is to do them a favor. Surprisingly, doing something for someone you dislike, actually makes you like them a bit more due to Cognitive dissonance. Basically, we strive for internal consistency and want our thoughts and actions to be consistent. It doesn\'t make sense to do something nice for someone we dislike, so we trick ourselves into thinking we actually do like them.I actually tried this once, and it did work -- in the short term. Finally, try to focus on the things you do like about this person. Perhaps they have nice kids, or like the same sports team you do. Whatever it is, just steer the conversation towards common interests, and getting work done, and away from the behavior you dislike. As Abraham Lincoln says: "The best way to destroy an enemy is to make him a friend."'

It flies mostly small local airlines, offering flights to San Juan. The attitude at the airport is informal and friendly. And at airport security, there was an adorably friendly stray puppy running around. The puppy lived at the airport. He was small, but looked reasonably healthy, and well cared for-- he was well fed by tourists at the security check in. He even had a hat and some clothes on. A woman in our line, took it a step further. She took a liking to the puppy, and actually put him in her purse and began walking to her flight! The security folks reluctantly let her.I'm not sure if she was able to take the puppy on the small plane to San Juan, but I really wouldn't have been surprised. "

S' So far, in 2015 more people have died from selfie mishaps than they have from shark attacks! This small fact is a reminder that people should focus more on their surroundings, and less on their phone. Especially if on a cliff, in the way of moving trains, driving a vehicle, or near dangerous animals. Safety first. Selfie second. Reported selfie-dealths are 12 so far this year. In this same period of time, there have been 8 deaths caused by sharks.(Source: More people have died from selfies than shark attacks this year)Taking selfies can be stupid and unflattering, yes. Turns out they can also be lethal. A tourist just died at the Taj Mahal, after falling down stairs while attempting to take a selfie. 4 of this year\'s selfie-deaths were caused by falling. Many others including selfie-takers being hit by trains, or getting into high speed car crashes.The Guardian reports 2 men accidentally blew themselves up in the Russian Ural mountains, "when posing with a live grenade. The picture was discovered saved to the camera roll on one of the mens phones."'

S' Gold purity is measured in carats, so the difference between 10kt, 14kt, 18kt, and 22 kt refers to how pure the gold is. Higher carats = higher gold percentage, which is more more valuable. Higher carat gold also has a much more vivid yellow color. Higher carat gold is also a lot softer and less durable than lower carat gold. Subsequently, a cheaper, 10k gold ring will be more durable, but less bright and lustrous, than a more valuable 22 carat gold ring. Gold is very soft-- it measures 2.5-3 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. Diamonds measure around 10. You can probably leave a bite mark if you bite really hard into 24 carat gold. This softness makes gold easy to work with, but other alloys need to be added to make more durable jewelry. Typically, Silver, Copper, Nickel, Tin, Palladium, Zinc and Manganese are added to non-24 karat "Gold" jewelry.Personal preference depends a lot on the desired color, price, durability, and also allergies. Many people are allergic to alloys (commonly Nickel) and cannot wear lower quality "gold" without breaking out in rashes. 24K = the purest gold. Bright yellow and very soft and expensive. Most Americans have never even seen 24k gold jewelry. It is very rare in the US, because it bends, dings, dents, and scratches easily.22k = ~ 92% pure gold. The standard in the high-end Indian, Asian, and Middle Eastern markets. 22k gold is very vivid and has a bright yellow color. It\'s more exquisite and valuable for investment.  18k = ~ 75% pure gold. The standard in the European market and the choice for high-end fine jewelry in the US. It is more vivid than 14k gold, but duller than 22k. It doesn\'t tarnish as easily as lower quality carats, but is more sensitive to dings and dents. 14k = ~ 59 % pure gold. The most popular choice in the US, due to lower cost and higher durability than 18k. It is less vivid in color to 18k gold, but it\'s stronger and therefore more resistant to showing wear and tear. 10k = ~ 42% pure gold. The minimum karat that can be called gold in the US. 10k gold is more alloy than gold. It is the cheapest and most durable gold jewelry. The color is less rich and vivid, and it will tarnish more quickly. Due to high alloy content, it is also the most likely to cause skin allergies.'

S' Fear of missing out (FOMO) is an interesting psychological phenomena. And it doesn\'t just relate to a Friday night party or that next hot Tinder date. FOMO can be costing you money. Seriously. Understanding FOMO can save you heartache and dollars. In behavioral economics, and decision theory, the psychology behind FOMO can be partially explained by loss aversion. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman demonstrated people\'s strong tendency to want to avoid any losses. In fact, the research suggests that losses are twice as impactful on people, psychologically, as gains. This leads to risk aversion; we just hate to lose out on anything.To add to that, people are more FOMO to lose what they already have or think they have. This plays into effect when you are going to buy a car, looking for a house, or going on a vacation. Next time you are going to make a really big purchase, and if you want to save money, don\'t even look at the high end item. Just window shopping at Ferrari, will cause you FOMO and hurt your pocket book. Barry Schwartz did some interesting research on people buying cars.Option 1: Customers saw the fully loaded version of the car. Then when they said the price was too expensive, the dealer took away options in an effort to reduce the price.Option 2: Customers saw the base price of the car. Then the dealer asked them to select which options they wanted, increasing the price incrementally.Result: People spent more money, and were less satisfied, in the first condition. The psycological theory is that people experience FOMO and are reluctant to give up what they felt they already had.So, next time you are looking to make a big purchase, start by looking at the cheaper models and then move up. Don\'t even expose yourself to FOMO by looking at the high end options first. Another principle psychological principle behind FOMO is The Paradox of Choice. Schwartz wrote this FOMO credo, which explains that the more choices we have, the less happy we are with what we choose. Too many choices lead to anxiety and depressive FOMO feelings. The people most sensitive to FOMO, according to Schwartz, are maximizers, people who are always trying to get "the best" out of every situation. Maximizers are more prone to regret, and depression over the choices they make. To reduce FOMO and increase happiness and savings, the key is learning to accept "good enough." Reduce the number of options you consider before making a decision, and practice gratitude for what is good in a decision rather than focusing on regret and disappointments with what is less than ideal.'

S' Common mistakes new managers make have a lot to do with their ability to adapt and change. People who get promoted to management are often competitive and often got promoted by focusing only on their own performance. When they get promoted to management, many people find it difficult to change. As an individual performer, typically, the harder you work, the more successful you are. Management, however, is not so simple. More hours don\'t necessarily mean more productivity. Micromanagement and overworking your people can backfire and lead to less overall productivity. It\'s hard to predict when someone is going to quit, make a big mistake, or need a lot of help. Typically as an individual contributor each person is only responsible for their own work. And in cultures without good leadership, poor performers actually help the best people. Great performance looks even better when others aren\'t performing. People in these winner take all companies will not prioritize or learn how to help others, an integral skill for management. Being a good manager requires empathy, flexibility, and the ability to change course if things aren\'t working. Inexperienced managers will often have to learn these skills. Motivating people is also not "one size fits all," and inexperienced managers often learn the hard way that what works motivating one person, will not work with another. Surprisingly, I found that people are more motivated to compete when there are fewer competitors, so if you are looking to motivate your team through competition, separate them into smaller teams. When I was first promoted to a manager, my inexperience, and my ego made it difficult for me to share, and ultimately, give away the spotlight. A major challenge I had to overcome was to let go of the things I enjoyed doing and was good at. Things that got me promoted, didn\'t really matter as much anymore. As a first time manager, I wasn\'t prepared for the amount of grunt work. A manager\'s job is often to do the work that nobody else wants, or can, do. New managers will save themselves and their team time and energy if they quickly pick up the slack.Finally, I also learned that people are happier when they are busier, so it\'s necessary to keep your team busy. Idle time makes people restless and unhappy. Importantly, however, you need to make your team view these tasks as worthwhile. Inexperienced managers often make tasks seem like busywork. Great managers give their team purpose.'

S' Want to get some insight into whether that crazy someone is, in fact, a psychopath? Try this quick psychological trick: yawn and see if they yawn back.People with Psychopathic Traits Are Less Likely to Catch a Contagious Yawn than Empathetic Folks, Study FindsBrian Rundle, behavioral scientist at Baylor University, makes the case that contagious yawning is an innate form of empathetic communication. It isnt just coincidence, or lack of caffeine, when you yawn in a morning meeting when you see your co-worker yawning across the room. Yawning when others yawn, appears to be linked to a person\'s degree of empathy -- the ability to understand and connect with the emotional states of others. Contagious yawning turns out to be pretty common, it has even been found in other social species, including chimpanzees and dogs.However, according to Rundle, some people aren\'t as likely to catch a yawn. Those least likely to yawn, when you do? People high in psychopathic personality traits. One reason? They aren\'t that empathetic. According to Rundle\'s Research: "Psychopathy is characterized by an antisocial lifestyle, including being selfish, manipulative, impulsive, fearless, domineering and, in particular, lacking in empathy."Properly diagnosing a psychopath is obviously more complicated than just watching to see if they catch your contagious yawn, but next time you are questioning whether your new boss or new date is as psychopathic as they seem, try this quick psychological trick.'

S' Going to a top college can open some doors, but it won\'t keep them open. Similarly, not going to a top college can close some doors, but it won\'t keep them closed.It\'s been nearly 2 decades since I applied to colleges, and I can still remember and identify with your angst. AP courses, SAT prep, essay editing, and college applications are immensely stressful and all consuming. I vividly remember filling out those applications, and how much work went into it. The stress you are feeling is understandable. And sure, where you go to college can matter. All things being equal, going to a top school will help you in life. If only to boost your confidence and get your resume past the screeners. Also, top schools generally have grade inflation, and at these elite Schools It\'s Almost Impossible To Fail. It can be easier to get a perfect GPA at some of the top schools than it is at the larger State schools. However, it\'s not so simple. Or easy. Luck, skill, and resiliency will also matter, and ultimately they will play a far greater role in your success than which college you went to. It is unlikely graduating from a top school alone will get you hired, promoted, or funded. Sure, the stamp of approval can help, but it is doubtful to be the main factor. Once you are in the working world, most people don\'t care much at all. Each job you get after college, what school you went to will matter less and less. I went to Brown University, and I graduated around 15 years ago. So it\'s been awhile. In my last 2 job interviews nobody asked what college I went to. I have no idea what college the Director, or VP of my group went to. At this point in my life, it rarely, if ever, matters. A lot of people have never even heard of Brown, or most of the other fancy schools your peers are bragging about. A handful of schools have strong universal recognition, but prestige tends to be more local and based on your field. For instance, the Iowa writing program, and the Santa Barbara physics program are both top in their respective fields.If you want to go into something like Investment Banking or Management Consulting straight out of college, it will probably matter what college you went to. These industries recruit heavily at the top colleges and tend to be more focused on collegial pedigree. Yet, the richest and most successful person in finance today, went to University of NebraskaLincoln.Similarly, if you want to go into a field that will require an advanced degree, your grad school will probably matter a lot more than your undergrad degree. Also, for me there is power in being underestimated. I worked for years in Sales & Trading in a fiercely competitive highly adversarial environment. Being a woman, I was always underestimated and people never really saw me coming. You may find the same thing coming from a State School in Florida. People may not know how fierce you really are. Flying under the radar can be a good thing in highly competitive environments. Similarly, not having debt is a powerful and often under-appreciated thing. Without debt you will be able to take more chance and risks. Being shackled by debt is a scary and limiting. You may end up taking and staying at jobs you don\'t like simply to pay off debt. If graduating from a top college really matters to you, then go for it. Apply to as many schools as you can. It\'s a numbers and luck game. I got rejected from one of my "safety" schools, and many people I know got into schools they never thought they would, and rejected from others they assumed were sure bets. Diversify. Apply to as many top schools as you can (preferably in all geographies), and if you don\'t get in the first time, apply again as a transfer student. Keep applying until you get in. Finally, I haven\'t really seen any strong correlation with how smart and successful people are, with which colleges they went to. If anything, underdogs tend to fight harder.'

S' 1. Shoot in good lighting More than anything else: seek out good lighting. Lighting matters more than anything else. Seriously. An awesome photographer with a professional camera will take a lousy photo if the lighting is bad.The best time to take a photo is around sunrise and sunset. Blue Hour, a short period of time direct before sunrise and after sunset, also produces great photos.If you are taking a photo of a person in the sun, make them step into the shade. Shadows are unflattering and will make your subject look like they bags under their eyes--never a flattering look.If you are indoors, stand near a window. Florescent lighting makes skin tones look off and unflattering, and again, will give under-eye bags. If its too dark, your photo will be grainy, and will look lousy. You can get away with dark shots, if you are using a higher quality (read: Full Frame) camera. If you are using a poor quality camera or phone camera, and its very dark, don\'t even waste your time: you\'ll get red eye, and a grainy crappy photo. 2. Dont use a flashDon\'t think you can skip rule #1, and get away with taking a photo in poor lighting by using camera flash. It will give your subject red eye, and forehead glare. It also gives skin tones a strange color. Flash washes people out, and makes skin look oily-- it is not flattering. Professionals can get away with using fancy lighting, and off camera flash. However, it takes some serious talent, skill, and practice to learn studio lighting. 3. Simplify the backgroundDe-clutter. Aim for a simple background. Before taking the picture, check all corners in the frame, and everything in the background. A messy room, or branch coming out of your subject\'s head, will ruin an otherwise flattering photo. If you are somewhere interesting, or have another interesting element in the frame, take the photo with your subject to the side of the image.4. Take photos from above, not from below, your subject Generally for more flattering photos, shoot with the camera slightly above people\'s heads. Think back to that myspace angle. Think I\'m kidding? Nope. Ok Cupid researched which Profile Pictures got the most messages, and it turns out the MySpace shot is, "the single most effective photo type for women."(Source: The 4 Big Myths of Profile Pictures)For men, you can shoot up at your subject. They will look bigger, and if you are aiming to make them look more imposing, then go for it.5. Adjust your perspectiveTry a few shots and experiment. First shoot straight on, then with the person parallel to the camera, then turn slightly to the left and then slightly to the right, and see what looks best. Move around. Try shooting from chairs, or from the ground. I also like getting eye level with the subject, it creates more intimacy. '

S' Uncovering company culture can be tricky in an interview, as you are trying to get the job, as well as figuring out if you want the job. Most companies and interviewers hire people who they believe will be a culture fit, so it is important to ask the questions without giving away your feelings about the answers. For more on preparing for a "workplace cultural fit" interview, see answers here.Be friendly and professional when asking about culture, and don\'t grill the interviewer. Also, be careful not to ask leading or canned questions that will give you specific answers. Ask broad questions, and let the interview talk. Don\'t ever cut off your interviewer. You\'ll often get the best information when the interviewer\'s guard is down. A few questions you can ask to determine the culture:1. What surprised you when you joined the company? Don\'t ask anything specific, just leave the question open-ended, and see what the interviewer comes back with. It will give you good insight. If the interviewer doesn\'t say anything related to company culture, and instead says something generic like, "I\'m surprised the market is growing so quickly," then ask specifically: what surprised you about the company culture? Ask if anything about the culture turned out to be different than they were expecting. 2. What does the office typically look like at 7am and 9pm? You want to find out what times people are at the office. Often the expected company hours given during interviews are not realistic. For instance, I\'ve worked at places that scared interviewers telling them to be prepared to work their butts off late at night, when if fact, the office was a ghost-town past 6pm. I\'ve also worked places that said they valued "balance," during the interview, but the office was often buzzing well past 9pm on Sundays.3. Are the hours different on specific teams, during specific projects and times, or when someone is new? You want to find out if you will be expected to pay your dues, of if the whole company is constantly working, all the time. Similarly some industries have crunch times where things are extra busy, but then also have periods of downtime, when everyone goes on vacation. Asking if you will work with different geographies will also give you a sense if you will be expected to work European and Asia hours. Also ask if working at night and on the weekends is expected, and how quickly people are expected to return e-mails and calls during off hours. 4. What do people generally do for lunch? Ask casually if most people eat at at their desk or go out. Then, ask if people go out to lunch together, or if most people eat alone. If the interviewer says that everyone always powers though lunch and scarfs down a sandwich quickly at their desk, then ask if its the same for breakfast and dinner. Also ask if the company provides the meals. Ask if they\'ve been so busy that they\'ve forgotten to eat, or didn\'t get a chance to grab lunch. 5. Do people hang out after work?Some companies have a lot of official and non-official work events. Some activities are really cool and fun. Others can be a total drag, which turn out to be extra work, mandated on the weekends. Also, some companies are more social than others. Ask how often people hang out, and if the occasions are work sponsored (mandatory) or because co-workers are friends and choose to spend more of their free time together. 6. How realistic are the deadlines?Ask how often deadlines are met, and what happens if deadlines slip. If the interviewer says that deadlines are always ambitious, then ask how the deadlines get met. Are trade-offs made with the product, or do people work double time? Ask for a few examples and just listen. Ask the interviewer what suggestions they have for improving the process. See if the interview has good ideas and if they are optimistic that things will improve. It could be a red flag if they say that things will never change-- or if they say the pressure will only get worse as the company grows and expands.'

S" No, it's not true that Indian software engineers are considered bad hires in the US. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Indians dominate engineering at American tech companies. And they are not just the worker grunts. Indian CEOs now run Microsoft and Google.However, being from India may affect your job prospects, but not because of discrimination -- but because of the immigration process. Complicated visa issues may impact what jobs you can and will take. For your best chances at career prospects in the US:Get that MS in engineering. It helps to have that degree. Few Americans do. Generally Americans gravitate towards MBAs, law degrees, and medicine. This is changing, but still there are a lot of opportunities open to Indians with top engineering degrees.Start the process to get a green card as soon as possible. Once you have a green card you can take more risks, and your career prospects won't be limited. Start your career at a top company with great name recognition, the bigger and more prestigious, the better. Once you have the credibility on your resume, and your green card, begin to move around. Take a chance and do something bold and unexpected. Focus on your skills, not on perceived discrimination. Your engineering capabilities have nothing to do with your skin color. Good companies and top managers just want the job done, and will give it to the best candidate. It never hurts to be the best-- work to be better than your American and Indian peers.  I currently work in an engineering group at a large Silicon Valley tech company. The Director, VP, and CTO of my group are all Indians. There are more Indians -- all mostly software engineers -- than Americans on my floor. Interview at almost any IT department of almost any major tech firm in Silicon Valley, and you will likely interview with at least one Indian.People tend to hire candidates with backgrounds similar to their own, and with backgrounds similar to those succeeding at the company. Most hiring decisions are made quickly and the Availability heuristic plays a factor. So in that respect, being Indian may help rather than hurt you. Most Americans are not discriminatory. I've been involved with lots of hiring decisions and heard many behind the scenes conversations. I've never once heard anyone directly say an Indian, or anyone of any race, was a bad hire because of their skin color. Now of course, there will always be some people who are ignorant. You may occasionally hear these rude comments, but I don't believe they are the norm, and I wouldn't focus on them. Certainly women, and other minorities vying for engineering jobs will hear similarly crappy comments. Yet, of all groups in software engineering, I think discrimination against Indian engineers is probably the least common, especially in tech and in Silicon Valley.Now for the harder part that actually may impact your job prospects: navigating the immigration process. Visa issues can prohibit opportunity and limit job prospects. The US distributes visas by lottery, and the number of H-1B is capped by Congress. The process is complicated and limiting. Once you graduate from your MS program, and are looking for a job, you will need your employer to sponsor your H-1B visa. If they want to hire you, it won't typically be a problem. Especially in the Bay Area. However, the company does have to pay additional money (approx $2-5K) and generally make the case that you have specialized skills that an American doesn't. If you are on H-1B visa and want to move to another job, again you will need the new company to transfer your visa. Not every company will do it, and this could limit your prospects. Smaller companies and new start-ups aren't always as familiar and comfortable with the process, and may not sponsor you. Many Indians are therefore more conservative with their jobs and careers. They gravitate towards, and stay longer, at safer jobs, because they can't afford to take as much risk. If an Indian gets laid off, or the company they work for goes bust, they will need to quickly find another employment sponsor. If they can't, they have to go back to India. Americans can take a risky job, without worrying about deportation. Similarly companies that have just gone through big lay-offs often can't or won't sponsor H-1b visas during that time. So companies like these, going through transition and tough times-- which ironically are often very good for career growth and opportunity-- can be off limits for those on work visas. Once you get your H-1B visa, you will need to ask your employer to sponsor your green card (GC). Good companies will do this for you. However, once the GC process starts, it takes some time, and is complicated, with many steps. Yo have no control over how quickly it will get done. And switching companies while you are in the process of getting your GC can be scary, so many Indian engineers generally stay with the same company until they get the GC-- which can take up to 7-8 years. Once you fianlly have your GC, then you are a free bird and can move around. There won't really be any issues with your job prospects or types of companies ready to hire you. Americans generally consider Indians to be great engineers because Indian technical schools are believed to be just as good, or better, than those in the US. Indians particularly dominate in engineering. However, you will need to prove your worth, just like everyone else. Ultimately, your skills and some luck, rather than your skin color, will be the determining factors of your job prospects."

S' Whether or not a good salesperson will make a good sales manager has a lot to do with the culture they are in, and their ability to adapt and change. Good salespeople are competitive. Sadly, often even more competitive with members of their own team, than they are with external competitors. Many good salespeople get good by focusing only on their numbers at the expense of everything, and everyone, else. When they get promoted to management, many salespeople with this mentality, will find it difficult to change their way of thinking.Typically in sales, each person is only responsible for their own quota. Internal company performance is individual and seemingly clear-cut: leader-boards make it easy to see who is on top and who is on bottom. Commissions and promotions are also often based on how someone performs vs. how the rest of the team does.In companies without good sales leadership, poor performers actually help the best salespeople. Great sales numbers look even better when others aren\'t performing. Salespeople in this winner take all culture, will not prioritize or learn how to help others, an integral skill for sales management. Highlighting that "no deal is won or lost alone," Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff writes about great sales management in his book about building Salesforce, Behind the Cloud. Benioff shares ways to change this type of sales mentality. Salesforces sales executive, David Rudnitsky was largely responsible for leading enterprise sales and Rudnitsky taught many valuable lessons for anyone looking to move into sales management:Every deal should be touched by multiple people. Trust the people around you and divide and conquer. "I\'m less impressed with someone who closes a $2 million deal alone than I am with someone who brought all of us in and still closed the same $2 million deal," says David. At a minimum, bringing in the rest of the team helps mitigate risk, and in most cases, helps sell more.  When I was first promoted to sales manager, inexperience, and my salesman\'s ego made it difficult for me to share, and ultimately, give away the spotlight. I was resistant to pass on my best clients. But I had to. I no longer had time to schmooze. My team closed the deals. I stayed behind, answered calls from angry customers, tried to collect on past due payment, and kept up with everything that needed to get done. A major challenge I had to overcome as an new sales manager was to let go of the things I enjoyed doing and was good at. Things that got me promoted, like good rapport with clients, didn\'t really matter as much anymore. As a first time sales manager, I wasn\'t prepared for the amount of grunt work. I grudgingly learned that my job was to do the work that nobody else wanted to do. Upper management praised my top people for their awesome numbers and blamed me for those not making progress. Frustrated dealing with lots of crazy problems, that other people created? Welcome to management! In sales, it\'s also clear who closed the deal. And typically, the harder you work, the more sales you make. The more sales you close, the more successful you are. Contrary to popular opinion, good salespeople typically work much harder than everyone else. They may make it look easy, but don\'t be fooled-- good salespeople are extremely hard working, mentally strong, and efficient with their time.Sales management, however, is not so simple. It\'s not always clear who added the value. More hours don\'t necessarily mean more productivity. Running a sales team isn\'t just about sales and achieving sales numbers. There is a lot more to sales management than meeting quota. Being a good sales manager is also about recruiting, training and promoting people-- skills not necessarily inherent to a good salesperson. For example, when I was a new manager, and someone on my team began giving me suggestions on what I could do differently, initially I went back to my more traditional sales mentality and worried that we were still in competition. I was annoyed. He wasn\'t hitting his sales targets and was instead spending time giving me ideas on how to do my job. I was resistant and wasted a lot of time and energy wanting him to just "be quiet and do his job." He wasn\'t the best salesperson but he had the best ideas on how to improve the team\'s overall strategy. He hated cold calling, and being on the phone, a necessary skill for a salesperson, but not a sales manager. I quickly realized that my numbers would improve if we worked together. His individual sales numbers still sucked, but his ideas helped to improve the team\'s performance. I could have easily fired him because his numbers were low, but instead I informally treated him as my sales manager and soon enough, his promotion was made formal. To my surprise, I also got another promotion. Not something that happens in traditional sales, when someone else performs well. Sales is often a zero sum game, where each sales person tries to get as much of the pie for themselves as possible, whereas sales management is about expanding the pie.'

S' Liberals and conservatives disagree about a lot of things. However, when ranking the "worst presidents," they show a striking degree of consensus. For example, in the Murray-Blessing survey, a famous Historical ranking of Presidents, liberal and conservative historians agreed on 6 of the 7 worst Presidents. Warren G.Harding, Ulysses S. Grant, and Richard Nixon are often considered failed Presidents, because of massive corruption in their administrations.Warren G. Harding\'s name is inextricably linked with Teapot Dome scandal, just as Richard Nixon\'s is with Watergate. Yet, Richard Nixon\'s legacy is more mixed than an other US president on the "worst list." Nixon is considered bad by both parties, but liberals tend to view him as worse than conservatives. Richard Nixon was the first American president to visit communist China and he is given credit for opening relations with what is today, America\'s most important trade partner. Surprisingly, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) were also created on Nixon\'s watch. The Presidents before and after Abraham Lincoln are also both considered monumental failures by liberals and conservatives. They were the wrong men, at the wrong time and were unable to rise to the Presidential occasion.James Buchanan did nothing to save the Union and his pathetic response to secession and the crisis preceding the Civil War are "deemed the greatest single failure of any American President" by many historians, including Kenneth C. Davis. Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House of Representatives, and Reconstruction was held back under his leadership. Jimmy Carter\'s legacy is more split among political party lines. Liberals generally give Carter more credit for the Middle East Peace Agreement, while conservatives consider him a failure for the Iran hostage situation, and the energy crisis.'

S' There is no consensus of who the "richest man in the world is," so yes, they could keep the value of their wealth a secret. The 2015 Forbes List values, individuals assetsincluding stakes in public and private companies, real estate, yachts, art and cash, and places Bill Gates back in the top spot.(Source: The World\'s Billionaires)For these billionaires, it would be difficult for them to keep their wealth a secret. People like Bill Gates, Carlos Slim, and Warren Buffet, make their money through public companies, and you can quickly check their net worth by the minute.However, not all rich people are as easy to value.One of the richest men I ever met kept his wealth a secret. He is not the richest man in the world, but he has billions, and someone like him may well be in the top spot. I couldn\'t find this guy on Google, and on paper he barely exists. His wealth, properties, and investments are held in multiple layers of shell companies, trusts, offshore accounts, foundations, and holding companies, which were not linked to him directly.Political and royal figures also have ways of hiding their money, and can largely keep the value of their wealth a secret. For instance, Vladimir Putin\'s wealth is a subject of hot contention. Many people believe Vladimir Putins Net Worth In 2015 is Higher Than Bill Gates? Putins salary is nine million rubles, or $145,000, per year, but Putin doesn\'t seem to even care.Frankly, I dont even know my own salary  they just give it to me, and I put it away in my account. Putin does not even show up on the Forbes List. When asked about his net worth, Forbes told newsweek: Vladimir Putin is not on the list because we have not been able to verify his ownership of assets worth $1 billion or more.Quantifying the wealth of dictators and royals is difficult. For instance, the wealth of Queen Elizabeth II is also largely a secret. Officially Forbes values her wealth at $500 million. However, just one of her private residences -- Buckingham Palace -- is estimated to be worth $5 billion. Wealth of this magnitude is also highly illiquid and very difficult to sell. So how much wealth does Vladimir Putin and the Queen of England really have? If not a secret, it\'s definitely not so simple.'

S' I\'ve had this happen to me a few times in my life, and usually the person I kept seeing in my dreams, signified something larger in my life. The person you keep seeing in your dreams, may also represent something more in your life. Sometimes it can be as simple as dreaming about someone you think about during the day, but often the people you see in your dreams can also represent subconscious desires and thoughts. Psychologist Carl Jung believed that dreams acted as a window into the unconscious mind. According to Jung, dreams can present "a spontaneous self portrayal, in symbolic form, of the actual situation in the unconscious." (www.dreamresearch.ca)For example, when I was going through a career shift, I thought a lot about work, and other people who I thought were more successful than me. I was subconsciously envious of some of my friends, who I thought had it all figured out. And during that time, one of my friends, a successful entrepreneur, often showed up in my dreams. However, now that I have a new job and am not obsessing so much about finding "the perfect career" (especially before I go to bed), this person has completely vanished from dreams. Similarly, when I really wanted to get a promotion at work -- but hadn\'t yet articulated the desire to myself or others-- I had a few dreams where I kept seeing my boss. Nobody wants to dream about their boss (especially me)... but during that time my boss kept coming into my dreams. I was thinking a lot about how much I deserved a promotion. Yet, I was nervous to ask for it, and hadn\'t really admitted to myself how much I really wanted it. Subconsciously, at night, however my mind was still getting comfortable with the idea and gaining the courage to act. Thankfully, after I got the promotion, my boss stayed out of my dreams. So, a recurring person who keeps showing up in your dreams could reflect a feeling or desire that has not been successfully resolved in your waking "real" life. Unresolved feelings are uncomfortable and we tend to replay them in our subconscious minds. People you see in your dreams can also signify the future and something you are excited about. Jung believed dreams can provide prospective images of the future. For example, when I first got pregnant, I had a few vivid dreams of a baby. Perhaps this person you keep seeing will have a part to play in your future? So, if someone keeps showing up in your dreams, take a look at where you are in the current phase of your life, and take a look at what this person signifies to you. Do they always make you feel a certain way? What was going on in your life when you first met them? Is there a time you always see this person? The person you keep seeing in your dream could be a signal. Is there something in your life that they signify? If so, interpret the dream and act.'

Patrick Henry at the Virginia Convention in 1775(Picture Source: Patrick Henry Center For Individual Liberty)Patrick Henry (1736  1799) served as the first and sixth Governor of Virginia and was a Founding Father of the United States. Henry was a rousing orator and popular political figure during the Revolutionary Period. His memorable one-liner is one of the defining credos of the American Revolutionary War. Henry\'s words were first proclaimed at the Virginia convention, and helped push the delegates, including Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, to battle. "Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death" served as a popular battle cry for the American Patriots, Continental Army and Minutemen."A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand." Abraham Lincoln at the Illinois Capitol, 1858.(Source: Abraham Lincoln Giving A Speech Picture Gallery)Abraham Lincoln (1809 1865) was the 16th President of the United States. Lincoln declared this memorable one-liner when he was accepting the Illinois Republican Party\'s nomination for US senator. This simple statement clearly articulated Lincolns views on keeping the Union together and launched his political identity. While Lincoln was defeated in this Senate race by the incumbent,Stephen A. Douglas, he later went on to become President. Lincoln led the country through the Civil War, and kept the Union together. Lincoln\'s radical words helped to solidify him as a statesman and man able to keep the country together: A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved  I do not expect the house to fall  but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other. We Have Nothing to Fear, But Fear Itself. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the United States Capitol,1933.(Picture Source:  Franklin D. Roosevelt Pictures)Franklin D.

FDR became President during the countrys worst financial crisis, and the country was paralyzed and crippled by fear. FDR came into the White House, and immediately took action to turn the country around. FDR\'s "First 100 Days" and New Deal, brought tremendous change and helped the country to move forward. His memorable one-liner gave the country the confidence to take bold steps, and brought Americas out of their state of fear and into one of action and progress.

Kings March on Washington speech was the defining moment of the American Civil Rights Movement, and the one line I have a Dream helped to change history. Historian Jon Meacham writes that, "With a single phrase, Martin Luther King Jr. joined Jefferson and Lincoln in the ranks of men who\'ve shaped modern America."Kings speech during the March on Washington put pressure on the Kennedy administration and Congress to advance civil rights legislation and brought racial inequality to the forefront of American politics.

S' Depends on what your strengths and weaknesses are, how major they are, who they impact, and how easy they are to improve.Generally, I would say it is best to focus on your strengths. I spent many years as a manager, and would much rather my team focus on improving what they are already good at, than working on things they aren\'t. And I\'m going to tell you a dirty secret about the performance review: don\'t focus on becoming the well rounded employee. When I managed teams, my best performers were often my worst performers in certain areas.For instance, on my Sales and Trading team, one of my guys who always hit quota, was continually late, missed a lot of work, and was often MIA during the day. It didn\'t bother me too much, because he was helping me hit my numbers. However, during performance review time I was required to fill out the "biggest weaknesses & areas for improvement" section. Would I trade him coming to work every day on time, with him missing quota? Nope. I wanted him to be aware of it, and work on it when he could--- but not at the expense of hurting his strengths. When receiving feedback, and during that dreaded performance review, ask what you do best, and how you can more utilize and improve that strength. Craft your career, and chose your jobs and positions, according to your strengths. If your current job involves areas that require your weaknesses, look at outsourcing them and partner with people who complement your skills. It\'s easy to get caught up on weakness. Most of us don\'t like criticism. It\'s temping to try to be good at everything. However, it is counterproductive. Better for your career to be bad at something, admit it, and move on to becoming the best at what you are already good at.However, there are a few times when it is best to focus on those weaknesses:1. If your biggest weakness is something relevant towards you career and improving it will make a meaningful impact, then you might be wise to improve it. For instance, if you are a horrible public speaker and absolutely hate talking in front of large crowds, and your goal is to become CEO, then I would suggest checking out: What caused Mark Zuckerbergs improvement in public speaking?However, if you are a rockstar programmer and only have to do public speaking at your brother\'s wedding, then I would stick to your strengths. A skill like public speaking is difficult to improve and will take a major effort, and lots of practice. It will not happen overnight, and if you don\'t really need it, then the effort required is likely not worth it. You are better off working to become the best programmer in your field. 2. If your weakness is majorly negatively impacting other people or your team, fix it. For instance, if you are constantly overly optimistic and give your teammates unrealistic timelines, I would suggest improving. I once worked with a talented, but overly optimistic engineering manager. They gave deadlines that were "best case scenario" and never panned out. Product was constantly late, and ship dates were never met. This hurt everyone. The investors were continually disappointed, and it impacted morale.It was really frustrating for everyone because no matter how impressive the final product, the team was always scrambling and "delivering late" in the eyes of the investors. 3. If your weakness is hurting other people, work on it.  If you lose your temper and go off the rails on your co-workers, work on it. If people continually say your biggest weaknesses is your toxic / hurtful/ or abusive behavior, take the feedback seriously, and work on improving. In this case, you will probably be too big of a liability to promote, and the minute your performance starts to slip, there will be a good reason to let you go. Bullying, humiliating, or yelling at your co-workers is not acceptable. Some people with hot tempers are super successful, and you might get away with it. But people like Steve Jobs, who famously lost his temper and screamed at his team, succeed in spite of behavior like this, not because of it.'

S' "The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge, but imagination." Albert EinsteinAlbert Einstein never took an IQ test, so we don\'t know his IQ. We can assume it was above average, but we can\'t say if it was 130, 160, or 190. Furthermore, we don\'t know the IQ of all of his descendants, so it is hard to know for certain that they did not inherit his IQ. There is a lot of controversy about the heritability of IQ, but I\'m not sure IQ matters much, especially in the case of Albert Einstein. Today the name Einstein is synonymous with genius. He deserves the moniker, but not because of his IQ alone. Plenty of people, and possibly even some of Einstein\'s descendants, have similar levels of IQ. But few people, and none of his descendants (so far), have made as much of an impact. There remains only one Albert Einstein. Throughout his life, Einstein proclaimed that, "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." He also was at the right place at the right time. World War II, the Manhattan Project and the push to create the bomb placed enormous emphasis on physics. He was given a large stage to flourish and advance. Einstein had talent, and a certain level of IQ/ intelligence. IQ is often believed to determine the upper limit of intelligence, but IQ alone does not guarantee that someone will actually achieve the maximum level. Had he been born in a different time, it is hard to know if Albert Einstein would have been voted Time Magazine\'s man of the Century. Albert Einstein\'s well known genius is the culmination and coming together of necessary, and rare, factors including:Capability & IntelligencePassion & DeterminationTiming & OpportunityFamously, Einstein failed entrance to early admission into the Swiss Federal Polytechnical School, and worked at a middling position at the patent office. Yet, Einstein never gave up his search for science and he had tremendous focus. According to Einstein scholar, Hanoch Gutfreund: "If one talks about Einstein in love, his most consistent love from beginning to end was science." Einstein married twice and had 3 children with his first wife, Mileva Maric. His first child, Liesel was born a year before they married, and quickly passed away. Albert and Mileva had two sons together: Hans Albert Einstein and Eduard Einstein.(Source: Einstein\'s Early Years)(Source: Einstein\'s Later Years)Hans Albert also became a scientist, and landed at UC Berkeley as a hydraulics professor. Hans Albert\'s IQ is unknown, but was likely reasonably high. In 1988, the American Society of Civil Engineers created the Hans Albert Einstein Award to recognize achievement in erosion control, sedimentation, and waterway development. Yet, the study of hydraulics, and the younger Einstien\'s research on river sediment and tidal flows did not capture the word\'s attention and rapture the way the theory of general relativity and physics did. Albert Einstein wrote in Letters to friends that, Eduard: "The more refined of my sons, the one I considered really of my own nature, was seized by an incurable mental illness." Eduard\'s schizophrenia prevented him from achieving much in life, and he never married or had children. Hans Albert Einstein had 5 children, 3 of whom died in childhood. Bernhard Caesar Einstein, Hans Albert\'s eldest son, also became a scientist and worked as a physicist, and engineer. Bernhard Caesar Einstein specialized in electron tube technology, and filed and obtained at least 5 US. patents. He died at age 78, and had 5 children: Thomas, Paul, Eduard, Mira, and Charles.Albert Einstein has many living descendants today that are thriving.  For instance, Thomas Einstein MD, Bernhard Caesar\'s eldest son, is a successful Anesthesiologist, included in Woodward and White\'s list of best Doctors in America. He is also fluent in many languages, including German, Spanish, and French. (Source: http://einsteinanesthesia.com/)Paul Michael Einstein and Mira Einstein-Yehieli are also both accomplished musicians. Albert Einstein himself was a talented violinist, and he bequeathed his violin to his grandson Bernhard Caesar, who also shared a love of music. Studies have indicated that Musicians Are Probably Smarter Than The Rest Of Us and some research concludes that musicians tend to have higher IQ scores than their non-musician counterparts. I am not a physicist. But I am married to one, and have picked up some lingo. I can muddle through an answer to What is a sub-gravitational force? I have also met a few Nobel Prize winning physicists and they are different from you and me. But they are also different from each other. It is not simply a matter of having a certain IQ level.'

S' If someone accosts you in a secluded area, and asks you to give them your money, give them what they want, and get out of the situation as fast as possible. If the person is truly only after the money, they will focus on the money and give you a chance to escape.In these cases, your goal is to stay safe, not to risk your life over a few hundred dollars. Most ATM\'s have transaction limits, so the thief is after a quick "grab and go" rather than a big score. They don\'t want to bring attention to themselves or cause too much trouble. It isn\'t worth it for them.Get away as fast as you can. Don\'t try to fight. And absolutely do not get into their car. Stay in the open and run as fast as you can towards public places. It\'s much better for the thief to be suspicious, than for you to be robbed, or in danger. So if you think someone is a thief, run. Cancel your transaction mid-stream, if you have to, and get out of there. Even if your ATM card is in the machine. You can always call the bank to cancel the card, once you are in the clear. Again, your goal is always safety, not holding onto your ATM card or money. Most ATMs have video cameras, so if they start to attack you, point at the camera to distract them, and run. Remain calm and confident. If you frequently go to unsafe areas, and know of people getting mugged in your area, have a decoy "muggers" wallet, with only a small amount of real money and outdated / old credit cards. If you are accosted, hand over the decoy wallet, to satisfy the thief, and get out of the situation quickly. The best way to stay safe, is to exercise preventative measures, and try not to be alone at a secluded ATM. Whenever possible:Go to the ATM during the day, preferably during relatively busy timesUse popular ATMs in well trafficked areas that you are familiar withIf you need an ATM at night, go to a grocery store, buy something small, and get cash backBring someone with you Be as fast and efficient as possibleDon\'t count your cash in publicDon\'t get a receipt to check your balance -- do it online or inside the bank branch insteadPut your cash and ATM card away immediatelyDon\'t listen to earphones, make a phone call, text, or look at your phoneRemain alert and mind your own business'

S' Why do some people always succeed in their life? Short answer? They do fail, but they define their own success and they don\'t give up.Everyone fails at sometime, and at some point. It is impossible to succeed without failure. If you never fail, you are not pushing yourself. It\'s easy to never fail and to be mediocre. Truly successful people rarely aim low, and they rarely play it safe.As Ken Robinson says, "For most of us the problem isnt that we aim too high and fail - its just the opposite - we aim too low and succeed. (Source: The Element, How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything)First step: successful people aim high. Second step: they don\'t give up. People who succeed simply keep going, and are persistent. If you can\'t define what success is, you likely won\'t be successful! People who succeed in life are specific about what they want. They are laser focused and have concrete goals. How is it that they never seem to fail? Successful people frame rejection and failure as temporary setbacks, rather than as permanent states of being. They don\'t quit when they have a setback, so the end state is not failure. They keep going until they succeed. So the end state is success. They pivot and change course, but do not stop until they succeed.Most people give up too quickly, and fail to achieve success for no other reason than they stopped trying. Or they keep trying the same thing that isn\'t working. Successful people realize when things aren\'t working, so they are quick to change course. They don\'t define their missteps as failures, so they are more flexible and agile to change. Because they don\'t view "failure" as deadly, they are more likely to pivot and to try something new. They also are quick to cut the crap. They don\'t get distracted by things that don\'t matter. Successful people are quick to leave toxic situations and stay away from people who drag them down. Success is contagious. So when people achieve success, they continue to succeed. Patterns and expectations build. Successful people like to be around other successful people. So, their network improves, and they get others to help them. People respond to, and want to be surrounded, by success.'

Jeor Mormont, the 997th Lord Commander of the Nights Watch, who led the Great Ranging was also betrayed and killed by his own men in the mutiny at Craster\'s Keep.

S' For an Indian, coming to the US, I think one of the biggest culture shocks is the difference in romantic relationships, and marriages in the US vs in India. Obviously, the world is a large place and experiences will differ, but generally attitudes towards dating, sex, and marriage are dramatically different in India vs Europe/North America.For example, my Indian colleague once casually asked me if my marriage was, "a love marriage or an arranged marriage?" This made me laugh. For an American, arranged marriage is very rare. For an Indian, arranged marriage is very common.In India, some form of dowry is still common, and culturally expected in many cases. In the US, a man (and his family!) would get a shock if they expected gifts or money from a girl\'s family. It can still be culturally expected for a bride\'s family to pay for the wedding, but generally the couple, and both sets of parents chip in. Also, I\'ve never seen a bride\'s family give the groom or his family gold sets or cash money before, during, or after the wedding. In the US, there is actually more of a culture of "gold diggers," and it is more culturally acceptable for women to expect the men to pay for everything.One of the largest differences that could provide major culture shock is that couples in the US have a lot more independence choosing their relationships and marriages. The families, for the most part, stay out of it. Most US Parents want their children to marry, and want grandchildren, but it isn\'t culturally acceptable to butt in. A Parent rushing their kid to marry will likely backfire and have the opposite effect. In India, relationships and marriage are more of a family affair. The families in effect marry each other, and Parents have a lot of input into who and when their kids marry. Indian Parents also get involved and generally don\'t want their children dating or engaging in pre-marital relations. In fact, my Indian friend got into trouble because her fiance only hugged her in front of everybody at their ENGAGEMENT party. It would be unthinkable for them to make-out, like many American couples do -- at parties when they first meet each other. It could be culture shock for a middle aged Indian to walk into a standard male bachelor party in the US. Not just the family, but the broader community in India, pays more attention to romantic relationships, specifically regarding women. For example, if a neighbor in India saw a young girl and boy alone at a restaurant, there is a chance that they would call or visit the girl\'s family to alert them. And the girl could get into trouble. In the US, nobody really cares. The broader community generally stays out of who dates who. To get a similar response, the couple would need to be practically having sex on the table, or the man would have to be twice the woman\'s age, etc. Most of my friends in the US dated in school, and again teachers pretty much stayed out of it. In India, I\'ve been told, teachers often would call a girl\'s parents to tattle if they found that she was dating a guy within her school.Also, the girl\'s family in India is likely to keep check on the girl and her purity -- at any age. In the US, once a girl turns 18, and is out of the house, they are generally out of their parents control. Many of my American friends lived with a romantic partner before getting married. And in India, this is rare, and if done, likely a secret from their family.People tend to be more sexually open, and provocative dress is also more culturally accepted in the US, and even moreso in parts of Europe. A middle aged or older Indian coming to an American beach could get a culture shock, where most American & European women feel totally comfortable in bikini or even topless.'

So you need to do your research and find out what you have in common with the company culture and people youd be working with. Go to Glassdoor, and other sites to check out everything that has been said about the company culture. If all of the posts mention that the company is crazy demanding and that long hours are a must, you want to highlight that you are a hard worker and are singularly focused on work at this stage in your career. If the posts say that the company places importance on work-life balance, highlight your hobbies, family, and how much you enjoy balance in your life, etc.Tailor your attitude, questions, and responses to the culture at this specific company. For instance, when I was interviewing people for a highly competitive Sales and Trading job, we were looking for candidates who were highly money motivated. When I asked a candidate his goal in life, he responded, I want to sit in a hot tub full of money. Lots and lots of bubbles, and more money. For this particular job, this answer was ok. I imagine it would be a turn off to a non-profit.2. Research the PeopleGo to LinkedIn, Facebook and Google to research all the people you will be interviewing with, and the CEO and high level execs. Check out their profiles and see if they all have anything in common. Did the all go to the same college, or no college at all? Everyone have kids or look to be single? Do they look to be into any sports? Dont let on that youve done all this sleuthing, it could be creepy. For instance, dont say, Oh I saw on Facebook that your cousin has a 2 year old son, so do I. However, I did interview with a candidate who said, I saw on LinkedIn that you moved from Banking to Tech. Why did you make the switch? That was ok. I felt that they had done their research, and they appeared thoughtful.Again, you want to demonstrate that you fit in. So look for things you have in common, and then casually mention them. Dont go overboard. Also, dont lie and say you are interested in things that they are, just because you see it all over Twitter. You need to be genuine. 3. Map out your InterestsI once disagreed with my boss and lobbied the CEO to hire a candidate who was very obviously not a culture fit, because I thought he was interesting. He came into the interview with a lot of good ideas and I wanted to work with him. Google execs often asked candidates to, teach me something I don\'t know in the next five minutes." I think that is a good question and something to keep in mind. Obviously, dont be a know it all or start lecturing your prospective co-workers. However, if you are knowledgeable about something, and can show passion and interest in a topic, do it. Be prepared to talk about yourself and your interests. Have answers ready to common questions like: what books or online publications you read, what TV shows or movies you watch, your hobbies, what you like to do on the weekends, etc. You dont want to draw a blank, or appear to have no interests, if they ask. Read up on current events, and have things to say to fill the empty space. Good topics include sports, popular TV shows like Game of Thrones, food, restaurants, and traveling. However, remember that this is still an interview, and you are trying to get a job. Steer clear of controversial topics. If asked your stance on something highly controversial, say it\'s a complicated topic and change the subject. Now is not the time to change your co-workers mind on gun control or vaccinating their children. 4. Be FriendlySmile, look people in the eye, and watch your body language. Stay positive and upbeat. People want to be surrounded by people who make them feel good. Also be prepared to ask your prospective colleagues a few questions about what they enjoy. Ask them about their hobbies, and what excites them. Keep the conversation flowing. Listen and ask follow up questions. Focus on subjects that all the team members seem interested in. Finally, have nice things ready to say about your current company. Think about a few positive and interesting stories about your team and be prepared to show how well you will fit into the new group.'

S' Thanks for the A2A. I\'ve been in this situation a few times. Both, when I have interviewed internally for other jobs, and then when members of my team were doing so. I\'ve also interviewed people in other groups for my team. It can be an awkward situation, so do your best to keep it brief, professional and positive.Keep in mind that your manager may already know. Usually when members of my team were interviewing, I had an idea either that they weren\'t happy or something was up. Also, if it the new role is one that makes natural sense for you, it may be obvious. Sometimes it is just time to move on. Also, people talk. So if you\'ve told anyone at the company, assume it may have already gotten back to your manager. That is ok. Just be careful what you say. Good rule of thumb: don\'t say anything to anyone at the company that you don\'t want getting back to your manager. Be straightforward, and keep your remarks short and sweet. You will probably need your current manager\'s recommendation for the new job, so be careful about being too honest about your reasons for leaving. Do not use this opportunity to say anything bad about your current role. Remember that this person is still your manager, and may continue to be so for awhile. If your manager asks why you are thinking about changing teams, keep your answer brief and neutral. A couple years ago someone on my team told me that they wanted to move to a different role at the company. They said that they felt it "was a much better fit for them." They then went on for about 10 minutes about everything they didn\'t like about my team, and how much better the other team was. I felt like I was being dumped for the Prom Queen. And I was caught off guard. Not so much that the person wanted to leave, but how they chose to tell me. It didn\'t leave me with a good feeling. This person didn\'t get the new role, and honestly, in the back of my mind-- and during performance review time-- I always remembered their negative comments. Most managers don\'t like it when their team is being compared disfavorably to another team. Be gracious and let your current manager know how much you have appreciated their support and their help. Even if you don\'t like them. Just be polite, and professional. Be honest about what help they have given you. Tell them that you have enjoyed learning from them, and will take what they taught you to the new role. Think of something specific that they have taught you and be genuine. When you are interviewing for the new position, say positive things about your current manager. Again, people talk. And managers want team members who speak highly about them. If you bad mouth your manager in any way, your new prospective manager will worry you may do the same for them. Finally, offer to interview and train the next person, and provide any support as needed. If you know anyone who would be a good fit, refer them.'

S' The biggest impediment to innovation and technological creation in India is largely political and cultural. India still struggles with corruption, bureaucracy, inequality, poverty, and lack of infrastructure. But considering that India just gained independence within the last 67 years, things have already come a long way. India\'s economy is growing. If India is able to continue to improve her political, economic, and cultural environment, I believe she will be able to leverage her knowledge and people to really take off.From an American\'s perspective:I work in an engineering group at a Fortune 50 Silicon Valley tech firm. The Director, VP, and GM of the IT department are all Indian. Most of their spouses, are also Indians in technology. Indian consultants from WiPro, Infosys, Tata Consulting, and other contracting groups have replaced full time local employees. Walk into any IT department of almost any major tech firm, and you will see more Indians than any other immigrant population. You will often find more Indians than Americas. Indians have conquered Silicon Valley.So, if you ask me: Indians ARE creating technology. The CEO of Microsoft (Satya Nadella), the co-founder of Sun Microsystems and one of the most successful VCs (Vinod Khosla) are Indian. Rajen Sheth, the founder of Google Apps, is Indian. Yes, it is true that many of these individuals are Americans with Indian heritage. However, a large majority of them are also immigrants. I think it is meaningful, because I do not see this type of technological dominance with other ethnic groups. Indians are also beginning to leverage their success abroad and are bringing it back to India. According to Jaideep Prabhu, a professor at Cambridge Judge Business School, The term brain drain is misleading because really we are in an era of brain circulation. Prabhu argues that the Surprising Secret of Indias Success Could Be its Brain Drain. He studied 116 Indian companies, and found:Leaders who had studied and worked abroad had a competitive advantage. This international edge helped them expand rapidly in developed markets, despite a lack of experience peddling their products and services in the West.The data suggests that pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy Laboratories, software and outsourcing company Infosys, refining company Reliance Industries, the Mahindra Group and Indias largest conglomerate the Tata group, all benefited from having executives who had spent time studying or working overseas. These companies were able to survive increased competition in their home market and then thrive even in the most-competitive developed markets because their chiefs had taken a crash course in global capitalism by honing their skills in the United States and elsewhere." (For more: see the Surprising Secret of Indias Success Could Be its Brain Drain)As the new generation graduating from IITs and IIMs, continue to innovate and work in India, we will see more and more technology and companies created in India. It\'s already beginning to happen. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) also has had a record of launching highly successful and technologically advanced missions. Yet, it will not be easy, and the political task is enormous. Comparing India to Germany, Japan, and the United States is difficult. Germany has a population of around 80 Million, Japan around 130 Million, the US around 318 Million. And India has 1.25 Billion. China has a larger population than India, and Singapore is a newer state. However, both of these countries are ruled by largely authoritarian governments. India is not only highly populated, there is tremendous diversity in India. Indians speak different languages, come from different castes, and have different religions. And the country is a democracy. If economic and political reform succeeds, and India is able to create an inclusive and pro-business environment, we will see India truly tap its technological and entrepreneurial potential.'

S' Getting what you want is difficult. And at times, it seems random. Have you ever noticed that the most successful people you know aren\'t always the smartest? They aren\'t always the ones you expected to succeed.From my experience, the people who get what they want are the most determined, and follow a similar pattern. To lay your hands on your dream:1. Know what you wantNot knowing exactly what you want, is what makes life complicated. The paradox of choice. To gain focus, you need to select a clear and tangible goal because the more you dream about, the more you lack focus. The first step in achieving your dreams, is to turn them into concrete and reachable goals. If you don\'t know where want to go, you probably won\'t get there! Be specific. Don\'t just say, "I want to be the boss." First you need to clearly define what being the boss means to you, and then set out a plan. Write down and visualize realistic benchmarks.2. Know what you don\'t wantThink of nothing else. Cut out all time and energy spent on anything that doesn\'t further your dreams. Don\'t get distracted by things that don\'t matter. Stay away from drama, toxic people, and time zappers. Guard your energy and spirit with everything you have. Surround yourself by positive people who believe in you and what you want to achieve. It is commonly said that you become most like the people you hang around and the the people in your direct environment. Chose your friends, colleagues, and partners based on their ability to lift you up. If someone drags you down, or drains your energy, cut them out. 3. Ask for it Once you\'ve determined exactly what you want, simply ask for it. Don\'t be afraid to speak up and be direct. It\'s surprising how much you can get buy just asking. Give people a convincing reason to help you. People respond to passion and conviction. When people ask how you are doing, and if they can help, be prepared with a positive and clear answer. Your network and resources will be more supportive, when you are able to clearly articulate how they can help you. And when people help you, be grateful for their support. Help others, and support their dreams. Celebrate the success you see around you. It is contagious. Don\'t be bitter or jealous. Make people feel good when they are around you, and when they help you. 4. It\'s never too lateReduce your goal to small manageable steps and reward yourself. Don\'t try to do everything all at once. Be methodical and have a strategic plan. Success is a marathon, not a sprint. I really like Bill Gate\'s observation here: Most people overestimate what they can do in 1 year and underestimate what they can do in 10 years.History is filled with successful people who reached their dreams later in life. Success and dream achievement have no age limit or expire-by-date. So whatever your dream, start now. Don\'t procrastinate or allow yourself to daydream about what you can achieve in the future. Start moving, and when you get tired, just think: Ruth Rothfarb ran the Boston Marathon -- A Race For The Ages -- at 86. 5. Don\'t give upYou need brutal determination. You cannot quit. You cannot surrender. Most people give up, when they are close to achieving their goal. No matter what the odds, no matter what happens, simply keep going.After all, as Baby Ruth reminds us: You just cant beat the person who wont give up. The winner is always the one who is left standing.'

S' Product is not scalableThe first red-flag that you should walk away from a start-up job, is that you no longer believe in its ability to grow. Defining a startup job can be tricky. Profit, revenue, headcount, and culture vary between company, geography, and industry. However, the key success factor of any startup is its growth potential. As Y Combinators Paul Graham notes, a startup is a company designed to scale very quickly.Many small companies generate impressive profits. However awesome the cash flow; the pertinent question is: how scalable is the product? Often at small companies, there are a few amazing individuals, ideas, or products, who keep the entire company afloat. Ive seen companies where the top sales guy brought in enough to pay all the bills. This is possible with a small team. Not so much when company grows 10x. Analogous issues can be found with industries -- restaurants, photographers, designers, etc. -- that rely heavily on one persons vision. If the company is paying too much to retain customers, relying too much on manual processes, or is unable to train employees, these can be scalability red flags.Leadership is not goodCulture comes from the top. Start-ups live and die with leadership. If the leadership is bad, leave. Bad leadership means that the leader is unable to grow the company. Look for leaders who have a clear goal, and can execute.Start-up leaders tend to be risk takers, and they might be maniacal workaholics. Good ones are often unconventional and see the world differently. So dont worry too much about that. The red flag appears when you no longer believe in their capacity to make the right decisions for the growth of the company.Top talent is leavingWhen people in vital positions you respect and know are good leave, its a red flag. You want to see the incoming talent get better not worse. If the company starts hiring C players to replace A players in the important roles, that is a red flag.Also, if people who know more than you do in critical roles, CFO, Chief Counsel, Head of Product / Engineering / Sales, etc., unexpectedly leave, or are suddenly fired with no explanation, these can be red flags.A personal red flag of mine is when leadership repeatedly talks poorly about current and ex-employees. (See: What are some tips and hacks for managing people?)You are learning bad habitsFor many people, not learning anything can be a red flag. However, at a promising start-up you believe in, I would say give it time. One minute you can be answering the phones, and then next day you can be leading sales meetings. Once you are on that rocket-ship, dont get off. One advantage of working at start-ups vs established companies is that you get to wear a lot of hats, and learn a lot of different skill sets.A red-flag is when you are learning bad habits. This largely is a function of the first 3 items, but if you have a bad product, bad management, or the top people are leaving, you may start learning bad habits. Listen to your gut here, and if you find yourself doing questionable things, check yourself before it gets out of control.'

S" No, being pregnant doesn't mean that you will automatically be fat. However, for the first few weeks after delivery you might continue to look crazy bloated -- I certainly did.I have heard urban legends of people leaving the hospital in their pre-pregnancy skinny jeans. I'm not sure I believe them. Generally, though, I've been pretty surprised by how quickly the body bounces back. Most pregnant women gain between 25-40 pounds. And right after birth, lose about a third of it:7 -8 lbs - baby1-2 lbs - placenta3-4 lbs - blood and amniotic fluidHowever, due to retained water, the weight loss may not be obvious for over a week. And by that point you're well into the sleep deprivation era of caring for a newborn that you don't care about fitting into anything other than yoga pants. The more weight you gain while pregnant, the more likely you'll keep on pounds after delivery. However, I do have a super fit friend who gained 80 lbs during pregnancy and lost all of it within a year. She credits weight lifting and lots of gym time. So, certainly how much and how you exercise, after giving birth is a big factor. If your goal is to keep the weight down after pregnancy, get into good shape before getting pregnant. Start from a healthy place. Then continue to eat well, with some well-deserved splurges. Exercise through your pregnancy. Drink lots of water. Eat fruits, veggies, and whole foods. Stay away from too much salt, sugar, and white flour. Something that really surprised me: I came home from the hospital looking worse, than I did going in. I had to be induced, and the IV fluids made me blow up. My feet and legs were more swollen after giving birth, than they were in the middle of a heat wave at 42 weeks pregnant. I got an MRI to make sure that I didn't have a blood clot. Thankfully it was temporary, but I wasn't prepared for it. Even after the swelling goes down, a few of my friends found that they no longer fit into their old shoes. This is because ligaments throughout the body can be loosened during pregnancy, causing feet to spread. Postpartum is brutal. The six weeks after giving birth are rough. But not because of the excess weight. Between putting baby down, picking baby up, and carrying around 8 lbs all day, you burn a lot of calories. Giving birth is like running a marathon. The body is exhausted and needs fuel. After delivery, I was starving and couldn't get the calories fast enough. Between that, and the breast-feeding, by the end of week 2, my swelling had gone down and I had lost about 20 lbs since giving birth. And I wasn't eating all that healthy. I craved, and devoured, donuts. Another good tip: get a postpartum support wrap. My sister-in-law who got back to her super svelte pre-baby weight, recommended wearing one. I got one and put it on when I left the hospital. It was uncomfortable, but worth it. Because your bones are flexible after giving birth, wrapping helps to push everything back into place. Belly Wraps should be worn for 4-6 weeks after delivery to reap maximum benefits.Looking at my belly now, it's still a little flabbier than it was before giving birth. Not sure I'll ever lose the extra skin, but I fit into my pre-pregancy clothes. It's hard to believe that less than 2 years ago, my belly was so big that I could barely squeeze into restaurant booths. "

S' Facebook excels as a platform for announcing news. They don\'t call it a "news feed" for nothing. As such, it\'s ideal for announcing a death. I will vehemently disagree with anyone who says it\'s tacky or inappropriate. (It might be tacky to announce an acquaintance\'s death before an obituary is published, or the news is otherwise announced by the family, however.)It\'s up to you to post what you find appropriate. I would advise you to make it clear that the person actually died. We tend to use euphemisms to talk about illness, death etc., but sometimes they\'re hard to interpret.I\'d also think about phrasing the announcement so that a "like" is appropriate. A lot of people will be tempted to press the "like" button to show support, but it\'s set up to backfire if the news is bad. (I am never one to judge someone for "liking" a bad-news post, but there are a lot of judgy people out there who may be quick to label the likers as insensitive or whatever.) But you can always say, "Celebrating the life of my brother, who passed away unexpectedly today ...." A picture with dates is good, as are stories or anecdotes. If you want to express your grief, that\'s totally fine, too. Expect a lot of nice comments; your FB friends will want to support you, even the ones you don\'t know very well. At the end of the day, remember that this is the kind of thing Facebook is for: to share your news and to foster connections. My best to you.'

The genius of Steve Jobs is that he made shopping more or less palatable to people like me.

S" So many cynical answers! I think it's more a case of temporarily suspending disbelief, like people do when watching a fantasy or science fiction movie. Haunted locales, houses especially, generally have some beautiful but eccentric features which kind of give you the willies -- just like the setting of the science fiction movie.If the movie goes on to explain things using junk science, you could immediately dismiss the rest of the plot. Or you could imagine what it would be like to be in that scenario. When the hero is scared, you're scared. When they finally triumph over the enemy, you feel a bit proud.The fact that there are enough people who sincerely believe, enough for it to gain a reputation as haunted gives it a little edge, some excitement. There are often mentally ill people involved (the Winchester widow was under a delusion that the ghosts of those killed by Winchester rifles were out for her), maybe a prominent citizen or celebrity. It stirs the imagination.And anyone who would visit an attraction for the sole purpose at laughing at the stupid people who seem to enjoy it, is an ass."

S' Mine was a financial coincidence. I had just gotten my first-ever iPhone, and had taken it on vacation to Mexico. Well, I lost it. First time I\'d ever lost a phone, and it was a brand new iPhone.No big deal, I thought I would replace it for $250 or so. This is what I paid when I signed my contract with the carrier. But what I didn\'t realize that the phone was subsidized, and the cost of a replacement phone was much higher. 850 dollars.To me, that was a crazy amount to spend on a phone. A friend offered me his old Blackberry (a very nice one, actually, but not an iPhone), and I started using that. But I beat myself up for losing the iPhone. "You don\'t deserve to have nice things" etc. etc. But this was a bit triggering for me, because when I was young, if I lost something it was hardly ever replaced. (I had to go through winter without a proper coat once.)So I began to consider replacing it, but only under extraordinary circumstances. I said to myself, "it\'s only $850." There were four days in the month, so I told myself that if I could earn an extra $850 in that time, I would buy the phone.Less than 5 minutes after making that agreement with myself, I got an email out of the blue. It was a former colleague from San Francisco, where I had lived about 10 years previous. He had an emergency, needed a brochure written and called me because I was the only writer he knew who had experience writing in that particular topic (obstructive sleep apnea)."How much are you willing to pay?" I asked.He asked how much I would charge. It was a quickie project, not a ton of work but it had to be turned around quickly. I said "I\'ll do it for $850, but I need to be paid right away."I explained the deal I\'d made with myself, and we laughed. He said he\'d drop a check in the mail, and sure enough, it arrived in two days. (The brochure copy I completed that evening.)I never heard from the guy again. (Well, except on Facebook, where we are friends.) But I did miraculously get the cash to replace my phone, and on the last day of the month, I walked into the Verizon store and bought that I phone.I still have it.'

S" If you want less shiny hair, you need to roughen up the cuticle by damaging it. You can bleach it, then dye it back to its original color, or maybe try washing it with dishwashing liquid or some industrial-strength soap.Alternately, there are hair creams that will give it a matte appearance, as will clays or powders. If you want to go that route, I would experiment with putting different things in your hair until you achieve the desired look. As far as making it grow in wavy, that's impossible. In women, I've seen hair change texture during puberty, pregnancy or menopause, but you don't want to experiment with your body's hormones just because you don't like the way your hair lays on your head. You can always curl it or get a perm if it matters that much to you."

S" College, for many students, is a highly social time. Students find themselves surrounded by new friends, and want to spend time enjoying one another's company. At the same time, many of them are discovering the pleasures of drinking. Alcohol is something enjoyed by people of all ages at parties, so it makes sense that college students will enjoy it, too.Sure, it's illegal. But it's not like the cops are running around throwing college students in jail for drinking. The likelihood of getting caught are very minor, especially if you are drinking at a private residence. And even when cops do show up, it's unlikely that any individual person will suffer significant penalties. (Of course, alcoh0l is also involved in more serious crimes, such as drinking and driving, but that's a separate issue.)There is not a lot of peer or societal pressure to abstain from drinking, just because it's illegal. In college, it's also easier to hide it from parents, who may have imposed certain additional sanctions that would discourage young people from drinking.I guess the simple answer would be: why would they want to wait? I would venture to guess that hardly anybody lives a 100% law-abiding life all the time."

S' A2A. I actually work with a major city newspaper on native advertising, and I can tell you exactly how it works. Basically, the newsroom is kept apart from the advertising and marketing departments. Separation of church and state.Native advertising doesn\'t just originate in the marketing department, it stays there. Writers, such as myself, are employed to work with the client to come up with native content. If it needs photography, it\'s shot by an outside photographer (we don\'t have someone in-house), or more commonly, a stock photo is used. The native content may or may not be bylined. At our newspaper, we run bylined stuff that is more on the editorial side ("holiday shopping guide for the sports fan" or "10 brunch spots with the best bacon dishes"), and any particular advertiser does not get to choose whether it\'s featured, though we are sometimes encouraged to mention particular businesses, but never more direction than that. If it\'s directly featuring a product or service, then we don\'t byline it. It will say something like, "produced by The Seattle Times advertising department" that clearly denotes its paid nature.Though there are times when I do write more news-oriented content, it\'s usually for native advertising for the publisher. (For example, I just finished up a monthly digest of business news, which involved curating articles written previously by the newsroom and published in the paper, then summarizing them for the digest). They send these digests out free, with the hopes that readers will be intrigued enough to subscribe to the paper, where they can read full versions of stories like this.There are lots of different types of professional writers out there, and I\'d venture to guess that there are more on the advertising and marketing side. (Everyone needs to eat, and it\'s a lot more lucrative to write material that\'s selling something than it is to get readers to pay for your content). So it\'s not that hard to find dedicated writers for the native stuff. Many of them, again myself included, find pseudo-journalism more interesting than other forms of sales writing.'

S' A2A. I am old enough to remember the era of the comb-over, and believe me, there were a lot worse looks than Donald\'s Trump\'s. A large percentage of my male teachers -- in their 30s and 40s -- sported these awful hairstyles where the hair on the side of the head would be grown long, then placed over the top like a strip of bacon. Combovers could look semi-presentable in a controlled environment, and by controlled, I mean an indoor situation where the head doesn\'t need to move around much. The moment a man bent over, turned his neck, or heck, subject his hair to outdoor conditions, it would fall apart.My generation was the first to embrace the shaved head look, and man, what a difference. Finally, a style that actually looked youthful (combovers are horribly aging) that guys with thinning hair could embrace! Besides the way it looked, it also gave the man an air of confidence. He wouldn\'t have to worry about the pasted-over bacon strip falling over while walking outside, speaking in front of a crowd, playing soccer or whatever. I do think some guys look better with hair, sure. But the thing is, there are tons and tons and tons of guys who lose it and so far, there is no better aesthetic alternative than shaving or cropping the hair short. (Although I realize that hair transplantation can look natural, but I hear it\'s expensive and probably uncomfortable.)Back in the 1990s, when the shaved head came into its own, the first impression I got was one of boldness and confidence. Now that the style has gone mainstream, I don\'t get that impression as much. But again, baldness speaks to confidence, regardless of gender.Full disclosure: The man I\'m dating had a full and bushy head of hair in his youth, but once it started to thin significantly. He tells me he decided to "take hair out of the equation" and now he either shaves it or crops it really short. (His hair is now mostly grey as well).'

S' Dentists will schedule their days around different kinds of appointments, which can include general exams, cleanings and restorative work such as fillings, which may be what you mean when you say "drilling."At the exam, they\'ll take a look at your teeth and the progression of any problems, hence the "teeth to watch" list. If a tooth does require attention, they will typically schedule that type of appointment separately. Even if it\'s something major -- like a cracked or abcessed tooth -- it can usually wait awhile. (In some cases, they will give you antibiotics and/or pain pills to tide you over.)Dentists will leave slots in their day to deal with emergencies, like broken teeth, but dental problems do not generally progress that fast. If they\'re scheduling you for 6 months out, you\'re doing pretty well -- my own dentist has me come in once every four months -- some patients are on an even shorter schedule.If you have a more complex issue, they may refer your case to a periodontist or oral surgeon. But typically, unless your teeth are severely neglected, or damaged because of trauma as I mentioned earlier, it\'s not like a regular, healthy patient is suddenly going to go from "tooth watch list" to "dire dental emergency" in 6 months.'

S' Up until fairly recently, ad agencies were typically named after their founders or principals. McCann-Erickson. Goodby Silverstein. Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.My guess is that the show did not require a McMann (whose title is listed as Chairman of the Board); he also may have been a partner in name only, or retired. Larry Tate was pretty old, as I recall, so it could have been a case of an older guy with clients and contacts partnering up with a younger man with energy and drive.My thought is that McMann was probably retired.'

S" One of the benefits of the widespread prevalence of photos is that people are being exposed to more images of real people. Twenty years ago, this wasn't the case. Most images you encountered were on TV or in print. Many were professionally shot, probably styled and posed as well, culled from a series of photos which may have included some not-so-flattering images.Today, I'd venture to guess the average person on social media views hundreds of portraits (and full-body shots) before they fully wake up in the morning. And most of these images are of regular people; our family, friends, coworkers, acquaintances and their acquaintances as well.We're being exposed to a lot of representations of physical appearance, and almost none of these are posed beyond the self-positioning done in selfies. And while filters and treatments are certainly used, we all have equal access to them.I'd venture to say that the saturation of images is helping everybody get a better take on how good they look in relation to everyone else.Therapists counseling people with body image disorders often tell them to join a gym. Not necessarily to work out, but to get an idea of what real people look like without clothing. And I can vouch for this: even the most perfect-looking folks will usually have something odd about their body; a patch of fat in some weird place, perhaps some sagging or scarring. Seeing the spectrum of real human bodies (not just airbrushed fitness models) can give some valuable perspective on one's own looks.I feel this phenomenon has been replicated in some degree by social media and photo sharing. Even models and celebrities are often caught off guard, looking less than picture-perfect, and these images are highly accessible as well. As to whether individual people think they are better- or worse-looking than they actually are, this can depend on the day and situation, as well as the psychological makeup of the individual. But in this day and age, I think people are much more likely to make accurate comparisons of how their looks stack up to others', mostly because there is much more fodder for comparison."

S' Speaking as someone who\'s naturally eyebrow-challenged, sometimes there is not enough hair to form any sort of attractive shape. And if you\'re going to pencil them in anyway, you might as well do it on a smooth surface. I went in for a waxing once. This was in my 30s, when I had more eyebrow hairs than I did now. The waxing person took one look at me and said, "Oh, honey, there\'s nothing to wax!" And she warned me that waxing would possibly damage the few hairs I had left. Luckily, at the time, extremely thin, penciled eyebrows were in style, so for a few years I simply bleached my eyebrow hairs, trimmed them neatly (well, as much as I could given the fact that the hairs are few and far between) and then drew on a brow with a sticky eyeliner-type pencil in a taupe shade. Then I would dust it with face powder and set it with a liquid bandage product. (My fake eyebrow routine took some time and a lot of experimentation to perfect, if you couldn\'t tell.)Flash forward 15 years and my eyebrows are more or less nonexistent. I\'ve moved on to an eyebrow powder, which has some texture and sets well on bare skin. It\'s funny, now that I think about it, my entire makeup routine basically evolved around my lack of eyebrows and refusal to wear bangs (I could cover up the eyebrowlessness better this way).What happens when I don\'t wear eyebrow pencil, or makeup for that matter? Well, my features kind of disappear, especially when I am tan (I have light eyes and olive skin), and I personally think I look weird, though my mom and sisters also have extremely sparse eyebrows. Repercussions, other than looking a bit weird? I don\'t think there are any. I mean, everyone has something about their appearance that\'s a little odd, whether it be an oddly proportioned facial feature, overly thick eyebrows, flaring nostrils and the like. I personally don\'t know anyone who waxes their brows and draws them back on, but I imagine they either like the look or don\'t want to bother with shaping and plucking.'

S' "From the mindset that brought you the Axe body spray commercials.." At its heart, it seems juvenile and pathetic. The kind of thing only a certain type of young, sexually-frustrated man would take seriously.Sure, it\'s peppered with a lot of disrespectful language and stupid jokes that might get a person riled up. The female dating pool, for example, is described as "poon" which I think is a slur on female anatomy. It also spends a lot of time pushing forward the notion that "alpha males" somehow have it better when it comes to, um, poon. And that game-playing is a good way to nurture relationships with members of the poon class.Ugh, I could get mad. But it\'s so pathetic. It\'s like listening to Tea Party conservatives drone on about Obama\'s Kenyan birth, or the chemtrail conspiracy theorists insist that some evil force is controlling the weather.There will always be fringe fanatics on either side of an issue (feminism isn\'t really an issue, but some people make it out to be). Heartiste falls into this fringe category. It\'s off-putting, but it\'s mostly just stupid and pathetic.Edit: the question has been updated to read "what do feminists think of women who like Heartiste." My answer stands. I can\'t speak for why women would be that interested in it. However, one commenter supplied, as evidence, this profile:Im a 20-year-old girl studying mathy things at a college. Ravenclaw/Ravenclaw, INTJ, phlegmatic, Miranda, assigned Scorpio at birth but I identify as VirgoI like effective altruism, LaTeX, planning things, arugula, and Chateau Heartiste. There are other things I like but they are probably all linear combinations of the above.I only write in cursive.My greatest accomplishment is that I was on Arthur when I was 7.Yes, technically a 20-year-old is a woman, not a girl, but based on her profile (the astrology things, especially) she seems a bit juvenile as well. Not all women are feminists, of course. And I would imagine that any silly thing is going to have its share of fans of both genders.'

These garments got to be popular in general for all sorts of exercise, as well as lounging, because there's always a place in fashion for comfortable, flattering attire.If they didn't exist, people would wear what they always have for exercising: loose-fitting or stretchable clothing suited to the activity they were pursuing."

S" I am not as lean as I used to be, but I am still very muscular, especially for someone who doesn't lift weights or do any follow any formal strength training routine.In a word: low carb. My core diet consist of lean meat, low-carb vegetables, lots of eggs, low-fat dairy (milk and cottage cheese), coffee and red wine when I want to drink. (Other than wine and coffee, I drink water almost exclusively.)I avoid most types of sugars, including both refined sugars and high-sugar fruits. I also try to avoid bread, pasta, potatoes, rice and grains -- even whole grains. I use oil and butter in small amounts, I snack on cheese, nuts and beef jerky when I want to treat myself.I still end up eating grains about 3 times a week, mostly due to circumstance -- when my BF makes me dinner. Note that I also made a New Year's resolution to stop dieting this year, so I don't really restrict myself -- though after 30+ years of dietary restriction, my healthy eating habits are somewhat ingrained (no pun intended).As long as I stick to my core diet, and exercise a lot, I can maintain my physique pretty well. If I was more concerned about it, I would eliminate the red wine and be more stringent about avoiding bread. (I do not have much of a sweet tooth, thank god, and I am lucky in that I naturally have a fairly muscular physique.)"

S" Great question! If you have never tried marijuana before, I would strongly encourage you to set aside your fears about smoking, because smokable marijuana (the plant buds) produces the shortest-acting, most predictable high.If you have the money, I would recommend you purchase a vaporizer concentrate with a low THC/low cannabinoid level. Your budtender -- the person selling marijuana at the store -- will be able to advise you on products suitable for a first-time user. The vaporizer is much less harsh on your throat because it produces less smoke; similar to a tobacco vaporizer compared to a regular cigarette. However, even with regular smokable bud, you will not need to inhale much to get high. Buy a pipe -- you can get them really cheap -- and start with a tiny hit, filling your lungs to 1/16th capacity, holding it in for a few seconds, then exhaling. Wait about 10 minutes, you should start feeling it. If you want more, take another tiny hit.In addition, when you smoke, make sure you are in a safe place, with people you trust. Queue up some music or a favorite movie (the Harry Potter series is really good when you're stoned), have some snacks on hand (your sense of taste will be magnified) and avoid alcohol or other drugs.If you decide to go the edibles route, know that these innocuous-looking cookies and candies can pack a wallop. You can hallucinate, vomit, feel dizzy, or get really paranoid -- it can be extremely unpleasant. Plus, the onset of the high takes a while -- about an hour or two -- in which time many inexperienced users will end up consuming too much because they don't feel anything. If I were you, I'd avoid heavy indicas (and indica hybrids) and stick to the sativas. This is not a hard-and-fast rule, but indicas tend to produce a heavy-limbed, sleepy, munchie-inducing high, whereas sativas tend to instill euphoria, giggliness, creativity and other, more social effects. You can read more about products and strains on here (Marijuana Dispensary & Strain Reviews), and also locate a recreational shop convenient to your Colorado location. Have fun and stay safe, kids!"

S' I am so glad someone asked this question, as I would have loved to have Quora around when I rushed in 1985. I pledged Alpha Chi Omega, which wasn\'t among my top choices, but it wasn\'t too bad. Later I learned it was known as the "smart girl" house, which may give credence to the first fact on the list.You don\'t necessarily choose the house, the house chooses you: Everything looks generic on the outside, because sorority girls more or less look the same. But the girls will know if your personality, values, study habits and the like "mesh" with the house. You actually might end up happier in a house that is not your first choice. But it\'s nice to have a choice.First off, evaluate your "package". I am told that girls submit these resumes, which include high school transcripts, extracurricular events and "other" things. What is interesting about you? Did you study abroad for a year? Play varsity golf? Compete in a national science fair? These special things will get you noticed, so play up your interestingness.If you are from out of state, or better yet, a foreign country, that also ups your interestingness. Own it and play it up. Have a streamlined "elevator speech" you can use during the tours phase. "I grew up in Magnolia, I have two younger brothers, I love to play the piano, I love Mexican food but can\'t stand cilantro." In this phase, you want to be remembered -- in a positive way. (Please make it more interesting than this.)Also, have a little story that has nothing to do with college or rush. Know the unspoken rules. Don\'t name drop. Don\'t talk about guys or alcohol/drugs (you can talk about social events, but keep it on the wholesome side.) Don\'t talk about the rush experience in anything more than the most vague way. Whatever you do, do not critique the sorority\'s party theme or presentation -- good or bad. (It looks like fun, but it\'s a slog and a lot of the girls will be operating on little sleep and a lot of overwork).Be yourself. Don\'t try to fake an outgoing personality if you\'re quiet, or vice versa. The sorority is looking for all personality types, but chances are, if you come across as fake you won\'t do that well.Looks-wise, appearance matters, of course. But make sure to stick to clothing, makeup, hair etc. that makes you comfortable. And err on the classy side, even though you may think you look "plain." Pro tip: check out the sororities\' websites and Facebook pages, and take your cues from the way the girls dress, wear their hair etc. You want to look like you already belong (and you will; after the first year, but sometimes high school fashion is looked down upon by the more sophisticated "college types.") Think elegant, classy, wholesome, fresh, happy/positive; that\'s the image you should be striving for during Rush.It\'s not true that they will judge you on the labels you wear, or how rich your parents are. Seriously, that\'s not even discussed during Rush Week. Many sororities, in my day, had explicit rules for what you could bring up about a rushee -- to avoid nastiness. They mostly want to make sure you will fit in with the rest of the girls, make the house look good (academically, as in Alpha Chi\'s case; they recruited a lot of science/engineering/pre-med majors and high GPA was very important; to some sororities, sports and student clubs are a big deal; every sorority will want its share of beauty queens, cheerleaders, Miss So-and-So\'s etc.), and be active in sorority functions (I suffered during Rush because I made it clear I was going to be living at home and commuting to school; this was seen as a sign that I might not be available for all the activities, and they were right in this.)That\'s it for now. Please LMK if you have specific questions.'

S" Marijuana is worse for you, hands down. Even though its negative effects have been blown out of proportion in the media, it can also impair driving, make it dangerous to operate heavy machinery, lead to overeating and, if smoked, damage the lungs.In most parts of the world -- thank heaven, not mine -- it's also illegal. Which means it carry punitive risk, and illegally-grown marijuana is often exposed to harsh pesticides and other chemicals that could carry separate health risks.Rubbing your sexy parts is not associated with health problems of any kind. There was a rumor that male masturbation lowered prostate cancer risk, but no clear association was found. I suppose that it's also illegal if performed in certain settings, like a children's park, but the same is true for marijuana, even in places where it's legal.The truth is: neither one is very bad, and doing one can enhance the pleasure of the other."

S' Nuts and dried fruits, for someone on a diet??! (I assume it\'s a weight-loss diet rather than a weight-gain one). Utter foolishness! These are some of the most calorie-dense foods on earth.This infographic will show exactly what you get when you throw a few nuts into your mouth. Eight walnuts, for example, will net you 200 calories. Snack Smart: What 200 Calories of Nuts Looks Like [INFOGRAPHIC]. Dried fruit is almost as bad, calorie-wise, except it\'s also delivering a sugar dump into your system, which is the last thing you need while you are resting.I would recommend snacks that are heavy on water and fiber content (fresh vegetables or low-sugar fruits, like apples and strawberries), possibly adding a small amount of high-quality protein/fat. For example:2 cups raw cabbage with 1 tbsp. low-fat dressing (under 100 calories)One raw apple with 1 oz. low fat cheese (about 150 calories)Two cups popcorn with 1 tbsp. melted butter (about 15o calories)One hard-boiled egg (about 80 calories)8 oz. 1% milk (110 calories)I am also going to be a contrarian on this "don\'t get so hungry you can\'t sleep" thing. In my experience, if you\'re not hungry when you\'re asleep, your weight loss is likely to go a lot slower than if you get up to satisfy your hunger. It can be hard, but you can sleep with hunger pangs. The plus side is that you\'ll have a lot of food dreams, where you can gorge to your heart\'s delight and not ever get full. You will also have less trouble waking up, because you\'ll be eager to get breakfast. (Breakfast is very important, so don\'t skip that.) If you feel like incorporating nuts or dried fruits into your diet, breakfast is the best time to do so, because you\'ll be fueling your body for the activity ahead. But please, for the love of God, save the trail mix for the trail.'

S' I usually do not answer questions that call for a list, because inevitably I leave out people who should be on the list, and I don\'t want to hurt anyone\'s feelings. I\'ve been a longtime Quora user and have come across a lot of amazing contributors. My list will include newer, highly-active Quorans, as well as users who are no longer as active, but are worth subscribing to for their past contributions alone.Unlike many "famous" Quora users, Adrin Lamo is both prolific and proficient. And by proficient, I mean he writes beautifully about a host of topics. He\'s known for hacking, but his answers on ethics are even more amazing (and highly insightful, based on his life experience).Speaking of ethics, I want to put in a plug for Steve Vettraino and Josh Manson, who write accurately and eloquently about recreational drug use, legal issues and other aspects of the so-called underworld. On a website where there are millions of people who write about technology, careers, colleges, parenting etc., it\'s nice to see shared knowledge on topics that don\'t have a lot of meaningful contributors.When it comes to tech, funding, startups and business stuff, I like Terrence Yang and Patrick Mathieson. Michael Forrest Jones insight into the hospitality industry makes him a must. Archie D\'Cruz, a former journalist, is one of the most polished writers on Quora, with great answers on Advertising (Ron Rule should be mentioned as well). Mira Zaslove and Dan Holliday give consistent, knock-out-of-the-park answers on many topics, but they\'re must-follows for anyone interested in careers and interviewing (as are Gayle Laakmann McDowell and Jackie Bavaro, on the tech/engineering side.)Karen Tiede has been brightening my feed lately, with her no-nonsense life advice. Cyndi Perlman Fink, Marie Stein, Stephanie Vardavas, Charles Faraone and Garrick Saito are other users whom I consider among Quora\'s sages. For a young person, Ava Glass also gives some sage advice, and his recent life experience post have been riveting. Not to reduce anyone to joker status, but if you want a laugh or two, subscribe to Domhnall O\'Huigin, Andrew Gutsch and Bianca N. DieselAnd love him or hate him (and I happen to love him), you should also follow Leonard Kim, because his answers always seem to blow up. That\'s all I got, have to get back to my regularly-scheduled work now. Happy subscribing!'

S' To add to Archie D\'Cruz\' excellent answer, the internet also has something to do with it. Advertisers used to put a lot of information into their ads because the consumer couldn\'t easily find it anywhere else.Today, it\'s easy enough to include a URL (or a QR code, though those things have not caught on, thank god) where anyone can easily delve deeper into the product features, benefits, specifications, pricing, shipping information, even consumer reviews and third-party endorsements.Traditional advertising used to be an important engine of consumer education, but at a price. It costs a lot more -- in terms of ad space -- for the advertiser to run long copy. And long copy does not capture attention like a stunning visual or punchy headline.Long-copy advertising is a dying art, and largely being replaced by what they call native advertising, which presents content of general interest or use to the reader, positioning the sponsoring advertiser as an expert or thought leader. So when you read something like, "Top 10 Travel Hacks for Students" (sponsored by American Express) on Buzzfeed, you\'re seeing the modern version of long-copy advertising.'

Taking a nosedive from my broker's high-rise office into the streets of Manhattan, littered with worthless Quora credit certificates soaked in Top Writer tears. I went home and hugged my children. Ok, so they were just houseplants but they are the closest thing I have. I called in sick to work and binge-watched nine seasons of Friends while drinking cheap wine straight from the box. I checked and rechecked my Credits balance, hoping that the millions would magically reappear. I laughed. I cried. I called up random people and told bad bee pun jokes. And then I awoke. It was all just a dream. A really fucked up dream, where I lived in a world where I actually cared about Quora credits.In all seriousness, I knew it was coming. As a Top Writer who's also a bit of a Facebook fiend, I was informed of this well in advance. At the time -- early June, right after the big Mountain View shindig -- Quora announced it on the ultraprivate Top Writers Facebook page. (One of them; there are actually several pages in existence because after awhile, TW Facebook pages tend to implode into fights and general nastiness, after which time everyone migrates to a different Facebook page and the cycle starts anew.)Full disclosure: I only had 24,000 credits or so when it was announced, having given my entire wad to a brand-new user to thank her for a brilliant answer. (It was worth it, she was dancing on air.) But I think, at several points in my Quora history, that I hit the one million credit mark once or twice.But it was never about the credits. Millionairehood is a side effect of Quora addiction. If you spent as much time and energy on the site as I have over the same time frame (close to four years), I daresay you might have been seeing a lot of zeroes in your account, too."

S" On the contrary, many intelligent people will keenly understand the impact their physical presentation can have on their lives. From an early age, you realize that people who look a certain way (cute, strong, intelligent, intimidating, meek, slovenly, confident -- pick your adjective) tend to get treated differently in certain situations.As one gets older, it becomes more apparent that, say, a boy whose body is large and strong will be less likely to be physically intimidated by bullies. A girl with nice skin, straight teeth and a slender body is more likely to be chosen for the Homecoming court. A teen with dyed black hair and nose piercings may not be taken seriously by the coach of the debate team. Anyone who thinks the surface is an illusion is wrong. It's true that we should strive to pay less attention to surface presentation, but we also cannot ignore its effects.I'm not the most brilliant person in the world, but yes, I would consider myself an intelligent person. And I fight the tyranny of body image every day. Even in my 40s, when some folks may think it's high time to give up the fight. But I realize that if I presented myself without concern to the way I appeared to others, I might not have such an easy time getting a job, or a date, or my grievances heard in court.It's not just my body, it's the way it appears when it is out in the world (because unless they live in a nudist colony, nobody is going to make a first impression as a naked being). And it's not like I worry -- as in have undue anxiety -- about it. But it's something I consider, with good reason, and I imagine many intelligent people do so as well."

S' I am going to be a contrarian and say it doesn\'t suck as much as calling from a list of contacts. Provided, of course, that you can cherry-pick your cold contacts, and are not strictly required to follow a script. When I was a teen, I worked a variety of pick-up jobs to supplement my regular income whenever possible. I liked sales because the money was generally better, per hour, than most jobs I was qualified for. (A high school student doesn\'t typically have too many choices when it comes to being hired, but if you can sell, you can get a job selling.)I worked two sales positions, both of them in the summers. One was for an investment company, when I was calling on individuals. The second was for a software company, calling on small businesses.Both advertised the positions as "no cold calling required." For the investment company, this was a little misleading. We had some "warm leads" in the form of people who had filled out an opt-in card to "learn more about retirement plan opportunities" or subscribe to a free newsletter. (This was in the early 80s, so nothing was online.)For the software company, the leads were similar: people who had attended a free seminar in business computing (computers being a bit of a novelty for personal users, but affordable enough for small businesses to own and use).The problem with the warm leads is that they were like the Glen Ross leads from Glengarry Glen Ross. These contacts were mature; these people had gotten dozens of similar sales calls over the years, and they largely were not interested. So most were not receptive to my message, or the freaking script for that matter. (When you hire high school students as salespeople, you can bet there\'s a script, and most telesales scripts are pretty shitty.) Sometimes, sure, I got some sales. Because in both of these cases, the product and offer were actually pretty great. However, I only made commission if I made a sale (or if the investor agreed to a follow-up phone call from a broker). So it soon became clear to me that I needed to hunt in greener pastures, as it were.So I turned to the phone book, for lookalike prospects. For the investment firm, these were people who lived in affluent areas who had "old person" names. (Myrtle and Orville Smith, at a single-family home address in a Ballard ZIP code, for example.) I could reasonably assume, given the phone book information, that the Smiths were older folk who owned their home, and might have a few bucks to throw at a retirement plan.For the software company, I looked in the yellow pages. "Smith & Co. Auto Insurance Agency." Looked like a place that could use some accounting software, maybe. In both cases, I also targeted wealthier towns and suburbs in certain cities, and after awhile, certain types of businesses that seemed receptive to my product and pitch.I didn\'t follow the provided scripts, though I used a large portion of information from them. And I probably played the "young student calling on behalf of my boss"card quite a bit to gain their trust, and possibly their payment information.So while telesales kind of sucked for me, as an introvert, making sales was very rewarding. And I did well, and later returned to sales at certain financially-low points in my life. It was a bit of a game, and probably helped increase my skills in the art of persuasion, which I use to this day as an advertising copywriter.'

S' Camping etiquette dictates that you pack toilet paper out after its use, and dispose of it in the trash once you return to civilzation. I typically will bring a Ziploc plastic bag for these purposes, though I am also inclined to use a nice, wide leaf in lieu of toilet paper.If you can\'t pack it out, the best idea is to bury it in the ground; spreading it around a bit so it degrades more quickly.Yes, people care about trash in the wilderness. On popular trails and camping spots, it\'s not uncommon to find a popular peeing area (behind a large tree, on a decline) littered with with wads of toilet paper, which is gross and not very respectful of others -- or the environment for that matter.Often, signs will be placed asking (or telling) campers to "leave nothing but footprints, take nothing but photographs." Or just simple "no littering" signs. These are signs that people indeed care, and that leaving TP in the woods could leave you with a fine.'

They will talk to you, review your portfolio and resume, and try to hook you up with gigs which can range from single projects to short-term on-site gigs.The pay can be pretty bad, since the agencies tend to take a huge cut for themselves. But not McDonald\'s bad; you can probably expect to make at least $30/hr if you are a junior (3-5 years\' experience), and up to $75/hr as a senior (10+ years experience plus a portfolio with some impressive stuff).But, this can be a reliable source of income, and depending on how much you are willing to settle (in terms of hourly rate and desirability of the assignments), you can reasonably expect work to come in via the temp agency route during the first month.Plus, you\'ll get a chance to prove yourself. Your clients may leave for other companies, and if they like you, they might hire you again and cut out the agency middleman. This has happened to me several times, and connections are very important in ensuring a steady-ish stream of work.2. Check out Craigslist. Seriously, this is where I\'ve found a lot of my clients. Look under "writing jobs" and "marketing/ad jobs," not necessarily "gigs" (but you should look at that, too). Often, companies will be looking to hire a copywriter, but if you apply, you can often start out as a freelancer (they will often want to"try before they buy" by giving you a project or two). Quite often, these can turn into regular freelance gigs.3. Work your connections. I\'d say that about 80 percent of my freelance work comes from former colleagues (who have moved on to different agencies and corporate marketing departments) and referrals from those colleagues. Develop a good reputation as a reliable, high-quality writer, and you will likely be top-of-mind when it comes to writing work. LinkedIn and Facebook can be great for this. Send an email to folks you know, or have worked with, and tell them you are available for freelance work. With a link to your portfolio, obviously. Also do this with any art directors, designers, producers etc.; they will often be involved in the decision-making process for assembling a creative team. Or they might know another designer who is looking for a copywriter.Any connections you can make to the ecosystem (the group of people involved in initiating, planning, writing, designing, producing and paying for the work, whether it\'s a website, ad/marketing materials, sales materials etc.) the more likely it will be that you will be considered for assignments.4. Be excellent.Ok, this sound a bit "Bill and Ted" but it\'s key for maintaining steady freelance work. Everyone wants a writer who is good, fast and reasonable. And nobody can expect all three, really. Most successful freelancers will hit on two out of three things (less-experienced writers may be good and cheap, but not especially fast, compared to their senior counterparts). But you can also increase your value by being reliable (sticking to your deadlines, being quick to answer email, showing up on time and prepared for meetings). You can do it by being professional (making sure your communication is buttoned-up, delivering your documents in a clean, neat and meticulously proofread). And you can do it by being friendly and easy to work with, even when you are not dealing with the client directly.If you think you will need more time, ask well in advance. If you don\'t understand aspects of the assignment, research them on your own and then get back with specific questions. Try not to put down the client or their judgement; if you disagree with something, be prepared to defend it, keeping the client\'s end goal in mind. 5. Keep track of your hours meticulously, invoice promptly. For me, it\'s easiest to track this using the Notes app on my iPhone. Let\'s say I spent a half-hour on a conference call, then spent another two hours researching the project and another two hours writing, I would enter it this way:8/7/15Qualcomm conference call, safety brochure kickoff .50Qualcomm, research, hospital acquired infections, current Medicare reiumbursement 2.00Qualcomm, writing safety brochure 2.00At the end of the month, I create my invoice based on the time I put in, per client, per day (with notes on what exactly I did), then send my invoices with a net 30 deadline.5. Keep a frugal mindset.Work does not always come in at a steady pace, and I cannot tell you what to expect for the first few months. In the future, you may find some steady clients; some of whom may pay you a monthly retainer, or hire you on for one on-site day a week, and this can help you plan your budget. But if you are just starting out, and don\'t have an alternate source of income, you may have to bite the bullet and cut back on clothes, eating out, drinking, entertainment etc. 6. A few other random tips. Freelancing for large companies is almost always better than startups, or heaven-knows, entrepreneurships or family-owned companies. Ideally, you\'ll want to find clients within marketing departments of large public companies like Qualcomm, Abbott, Johnson & Johnson (these are a few of my clients, all in the healthcare space but you get the idea).These projects will have bigger budgets, and you will not be getting paid out of the owner\'s pocket, so less griping when a project goes over budget or even on-budget. Charge the same hourly rate no matter what you are doing. They want you on a conference call, at a meeting, or to visit a store or whatever? Don\'t fall into the trap of charging a lower rate for non-writing work. Think of it this way: every hour you are spending on calls is an hour you could be writing for someone else. (Big companies will understand this; smaller ones will balk). Short calls, emails etc., use your discretion. If it\'s a huge client throwing me thousands of dollars in work every month, I won\'t charge for touch-base things, but if they want me on some bullshit two-hour call, you can bet those two hours are put on the invoice.I am sorry if this answer was rushed; I actually am putting off some freelance work due Monday morning in order to write this.'

S' I did, post 9-11. It was on a small local airline (Horizon Air, a subsidiary of Alaska Airlines) on a Seattle-to-Portland flight, which takes about a half hour.It was one of those small-plane flights that boarded from the tarmac, so passengers were directed down these fenced paths. Well, at this particular gate, two Horizon flights were boarding. And me with my terrible sense of direction took a wrong turn at one point.I get on the plane, find my seat and start to settle in. Captain gets on and does his usual speech, and I am barely listening, but my ears perk up when he said, "...and I\'ll be your pilot on this flight to Medford..."Medford?! Shit!! I flagged down a flight attendant and asked if I was on the wrong plane, and indeed I was. Good thing the Portland flight hadn\'t taken off yet. The crew called the other plane, and someone was sent to board the Medford-bound plane, check my boarding pass and I.D., then escort me to the Portland-bound plane. It felt a lot like getting on the wrong bus. I didn\'t have bags, just a briefcase (it was a day trip for work), so it wasn\'t a big hassle, and Alaska as a company is always very gracious about these things. I\'ve probably experienced more than my share of airplane snafus, and getting on the wrong flight was indeed one of them.'

S' My go-to, everyday workout is my commute, which I perform on foot, walking for about an hour up a non-minor hill (374 feet total elevation gain). My pace is fairly brisk; trying to keep the heart rate up while avoiding heavy sweating, and so my choice of tunes ideally matches this pace.I like to listen to Pandora radio, which chooses tracks based on what you like. One of the things I like are drummy tunes, because they go well with marching. Adam and the Ants is great in this department, for example, "Kings of the Wild Frontier" Check out the drumline!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M2gtZPvzWgOr Depeche Mode\'s "Personal Jesus" (DM isn\'t always great for workouts, but this tune is.)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Hip hop also has a lot of tunes that have a beat, which you can walk to. (Yeah, I\'m making a Dick Clark reference because I\'m old.) Lil\' Mama\'s "Shawty Get Loose" always gets me moving:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...There should be no discussion about workout tunes without mentioning Pitbull. "International Love" is just one of the tunes that will power you up that hill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=... If I\'m really dragging, I\'ll bring out the Knife Party ("Centipede").This tune will also rock the car if you have the right subwoofers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...And then there is Daft Punk, which I like because the music is really colorful (I have a bit of musical synesthesia, and the extended guitar solo is, to me, these wonderful explosions of blue and teal). This one goes well toward the end of the commute, when the endorphins are really kicking in. ("One More Time/Aerodynamic")https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...'

S" This is not necessarily a problem underestimated by the healthcare industry, but care needs in the U.S. are expected to skyrocket and remain high for quite a while, as the Baby Boomer population ages.Currently, Baby Boomers are aging in to the Medicare system at a rate of about 11,000 people a day. Boomers constitute about 28% of the U.S. population, and by 2029, all living Baby Boomers will be eligible for Medicare. (Eligibility for most starts at age 65.)Medicare was originally implemented when the average life expectancy was about age 70, now it's 78. The current Boomer population is considered by many as the Unhealthiest Generation -- as a group, they have greater medical needs than their parents did at their same age. And with advances in cardiovascular and cancer treatment (two of the biggest killers of older people), Boomers are living longer lives despite their often-serious, chronic, and expensive medical conditions.National health care should be a priority for us, in part because Boomers will likely not be able to afford the care they will need. Many Americans do not realize the huge impact of the Boomer population on healthcare cost, access and availability, which will affect us all."

S' A2A. This started out as one of those charming, Pinterest-friendly ideas, but as a person who walks pretty much everywhere, I am starting to get tired of seeing these Little Free Libraries everywhere.Endemic to the kind of affluent urban enclaves neighborhoods which also loves to plaster around Neighborhood Watch signs and cutesy euphemistic placards telling folks to pick up their dog feces, these Little Free Libraries are like fucking weeds.Granted, they are very cute -- and a great place to dump your outdated software manuals, Scientology literature, crappy fad diet books and all other kinds of literary detritus. Every once in awhile you might find an especially-dog-eared bodice ripper to provide some erotic entertainment (if you don\'t mind it\'s well-used appearance) or a trashed copy of a favorite trashy novel, but most of these LFL books are just shit.And there are just too many of them. And, funny enough, many of them are full of broken glass.

S' I am going to tackle this A2A from a male-female perspective. Why, indeed, are obese women much more likely to attain a normal (non-obese) weight than obese men? After all, the deck seems stacked against us. Women naturally have a higher percentage body fat than men, and body fat burns fewer calories -- pound for pound -- than muscleEstrogen is also implicated in weight gainLoss of estrogen, in perimenopause and menopause, lowers the metabolism and also leads to weight gain. And women start gradually losing estrogen around the age of 30, with 51 being the average age of MenopausePregnancy almost always results in some level of post-partum obesity, so many women will spend at least part of their lives obeseWomen are also more likely to be poor (even temporarily), and poverty is strongly correlated with obesityHowever, what women do have going for them is societal pressure to be thin, which generally starts in the teenage years. At a time when boys are often concerned with bulking up, or stuffing their faces with whatever Carl\'s Junior is advertising that season, girls are learning about calories and nutrition, taking up jogging or Zumba classes and reading beauty magazines (full of exercise, weight loss and psychological tips to avoid excess eating) effort to fit in with the model-slim ideal.By the time college rolls around, many women are already connosseiurs of salads, have a repertoire of lean and healthy recipes, and are likely to be engaged in some sort of regular exercise routine. The boys, well, they\'re still happily scarfing down pizzas and playing their video games for hours on end. This is not to say that girls don\'t also scarf down pizzas or pursue sedentary activities; it\'s just that women in general -- over the course of their lives -- are likely to have paid attention to healthy lifestyle factors geared to achieving and maintaining a normal weight. If and when a women does become obese, she\'s likely to have a greater knowledge base around successful weight loss strategies. It\'s also more likely that she has increased motivation to lose weight. You rarely hear about a man fretting "Does this make me look fat?" but it\'s a cliche among women. When men do finally decide to do something about their weight, possibly in their 20s or 30s, they\'re very likely to fumble around with ill-advised strategies that women know ain\'t gonna work. (And one of these strategies, IMHO, is going on "a diet" in the first place: as many of us know, it\'s long-term, consistent lifestyle changes that keeps the weight off, not a frenzied "after the holidays" semi-fast).'

S' "Scaring off the Bear"Like Tula in My Big Fat Greek Wedding, I have a huge family. Twenty-seven cousins, though one sadly passed away a few years ago. When I was a child, all but one lived in Canada, and we lived in Seattle. So practically every summer, our family of six would pack up the Mercury station wagon and tent trailer for an extended road trip to visit our many relatives, and also do some camping in the Canadian Rockies, where my dad grew up.Though we typically stayed at established campsites, the wilderness was right outside the door. Towering mountains, gigantic evergreen trees, crystalline rivers. And bears. Lots of bears. It was not uncommon for these bears to come poking around the campsite, looking for food. During these times, my dad would make all the kids get into the car for protection, while he make bearlike sounds and gestures to make the animal go away. (It worked.) He\'s not the biggest guy around, but he wasn\'t afraid of no bears.On one of these trips, I was on a walk with my two sisters. I was eight, Mary was seven, and Joanne was four. She was small for her age, even by 1970\'s standards (kids were scrawnier back then). Probably about 35 pounds and a bit over 3 feet tallOn our walk and pinecone-gathering expedition, we encountered -- guess what? -- a bear. So little Joanne did what any four-year-old with a bear-scaring dad for a role model would do:Yep, tiny Joanne got on her tippy-toes, raised up her arms and growled, "ROAAAR!" Bear stared at her, probably astounded at her audacity. Then, after a minute or two, he lumbered away. I laugh to think about what would happen if this were to occur in 2015 (and there was video to show). The public would be horrified, our parents would probably be arrested and charged, and nobody would likely be allowed to venture outside the immediate confines of the campground until it had been reliably de-bearified. But this being the early 1970s, it just made for an interesting story to tell around the campfire.'

S" A2A. It couldn't hurt. Ok, the shot itself might hurt a bit, but if you are worried about it -- and if you haven't had a tetanus shot in the past 10 years -- I would get one for peace of mind's sake.Googling it, WebMD states that tetanus is usually transmitted through deep punctures, not scrapes, though it is possible to contract it from a scrape. I'd recently got a tetanus booster, even though I did not ask for it, because it was a new combination vaccine called TDap, which protects against whooping cough. (There was an outbreak in my area, and I spend a lot of time with little children, who have weaker immune systems.)"

S' In my experience, it\'s fairly hard to tone the inner thighs enough to see some "tone," so if you are really worried about it, I\'d suggest you wear a skirt or pants (with Spanx pantyhose underneath) to this event if you are self-conscious about how your inner thighs look.You could try doing some isometric exercises at your desk. Get a small (10" to 12") exercise ball or some other similar-size object and place inside your knees. Squeeze hard for a count of ten, then release and repeat. If you can work to fatigue, you are working your muscle. But keep in mind that the inner thigh muscles are really small (see below), and they\'re not likely to grow very large in a short amount of time (larger muscles give the appearance of being toned, as does lower body fat). But you might see a bit of difference in time for your event.'

S' This question reminds me of the adage, "Don\'t believe everything you think." And the more life experience I get, the more I find myself thinking in shades of grey, and my agreements becoming more context-based and contingent.I certainly will upvote some answers that I disagree with. I don\'t know everything, and even things I think I know may not be true in certain circumstances. Especially those which I have arrived at by observation, rather than direct experience. (And even direct experience can be skewed, because it\'s often anecdotal and may cause me to selectively pay attention to other anecdotal phenomena through the Salience (neuroscience) effect.For example, I\'ve upvoted answers on the eating disorders/anorexia topic, even though I bristle when folks make the assumption that all anorexics are unduly influenced by images in the media. This certainly wasn\'t my experience, and my gut tells me that imagery can be a trigger, but the pathology is driven by something deeper, and blaming media images is trivializing the problem. I also tend to upvote answers where the writer went through the same experience, but processed it in a different way. (How did it feel when you went skydiving for the first time?) This may not be the best example, but we have a lot of questions that are phrased less neutrally. In the skydiving question, a few people noted that "you don\'t feel like you are falling," which did not ring true for me at all. One thing I see a lot are what I call \'academic answers;\' viewpoints based on data and collective wisdom which are technically accurate, but leave a lot of salient things out. I might upvote these answers because the data-based conclusion is a good one, but not necessarily a complete one based on my experience.In these cases, I might disagree with the answer on the basis of what is left out. But again, the importance of what is left out might be a salience issue, and my disagreement may have more to do with me than what is really going on. I\'m pretty generous with my upvotes. If an answer makes me think, or gives me even one nugget of insight, it will get my vote, sure. Granted, I may also register my disagreements (or opposing viewpoints) in the comments, but I do like to read things I do not agree with, because I am not interested in ossifying my opinions anytime soon.'

S' A2A, because I will be getting 262 units of something that won\'t mean anything soon, to add to my soon-to-be eliminated bank of units whose number I don\'t carefully track.It\'s yet another policy change kerfuffle, and the kerfuffle part fascinates me because of people\'s reaction to it. After it was pre-announced on one of the Top Writers Facebook pages, many writers responded with expressions mirroring the Kubler-Ross Five Stages of Grief:Denial: "Just to ensure, the credits are actually going, right?"Anger: "I am very upset about removal of credits, since they didn\'t say how A2A\'s will be regulated without credits now."Bargaining: "Actually what\'s some method still available to get credits out of the system? Promoting used to work like that, but now what can we do? "Depression: "I am heartbroken already."Acceptance: "I think most of us have seen so many terrible changes on Quora that we just quit caring about it." Then, of course, there was the inevitable (jokey) fallout from the credit-balance-showing game, with wealthy Quorans humorously humblebragging ( "I feel like a criminal who had my assets frozen.") while others bemoaning their relative pauper status ("I feel lame; I never broke 700k..." or even "I might hold the record of one of the poorest QTWs.")What do I think about it? Other than enjoying the kerfuffle (and by enjoying it, I don\'t mean in a snarky way; the social scientist in me is enjoying seeing the reactions to something that is, at its heart, completely trivial), I don\'t care.Though several Quorans, such as Archie D\'Cruz, found some meaningful way to use the credits, more often than not, they were essentially useless. Sure, you could ask to answer folks, but honestly, the types of users likely to contribute great solicited answers were usually filthy credit-rich anyhow.I am a little sad about the loss of Promote, but honestly, I never saw a positive ROI (which a credit-counter may care about). I mainly promoted answers because I felt they deserved a bump in views or I wanted to encourage a user somehow. The user encouragement metric, I feel, did lead the promotion of mediocre or limited-interest answers, which is one of the reasons Quora gave for the change. Now, I\'m more likely to nominate good answers for publishing (on Publish This: Quora\'s Publishing Nominations Blog. Being published, in my mind, beats thousands of Quora views and a few hundred extra upvotes any day of the week. On the flip side, there\'s a huge contingent of credit-counters, credit farmers and especially credit enviers, to whom credits seemed to be a constant source of worry and stress. These people often loudly complained about A2A prices, declined or ignored A2As, or in the case of some popular writers, fretted about their A2A price or the perceived repercussions of passed A2As.The presence of credit-counters shows me that credits were certainly a motivating (gamifying) factor for many, but if the end result wasn\'t acceptable (e.g. the credit system ultimately encouraging the growth of quality answers, and hence the quality of the site by their own definition), then I agree: the system should be fixed. And "fixing" may mean permanent elimination, or temporary halting until a better system can be implemented. And I will join the Bargainers in saying that Quora likely will still store records of users\' credit balances, in case it wants to reinstate earned credits at some point, though I can\'t imagine them restoring the Credits feature without converting to some new system of currency.'

But at the same time, I did not quite have the presence of mind to communicate this.Seeing my deer-in-the-headlights expression, my friend said, "Get Mocha Almond Fudge.

(Sorry, but I can\'t really get into fancy desserts, I prefer my ice cream pumped full of air and stabilizers). I actually like Lucerne brand better than Baskin Robbins, Breyer\'s, Coldstone Creamery or even, as I said, the gourmet stuff like Molly Moon\'s.A distant second would be the \'Young Coconut\' (not currently on the menu) at MItchell\'s Ice Cream San Francisco, which is located about a mile from my old apartment in Noe Valley. There is a traditional coconut as well, but the Young version, with its fresh, meaty coconut chunks, is pretty good. Third on the list would be pumpkin ice cream, Breyer\'s.

(Holy shit!)Why? Mainly because I have given up on the idea of having or adopting kids. In fact, after I became infertile in my late 30s, I resisted dating (with an endgoal of marriage) because I cynically thought "What\'s the point?" (I\'ve always wanted to have children, but I was less keen on having some that were not mine.)I would say now that companionship and intimacy are pretty much the only things I want. I am also interested in keeping my assets intact; that is another reason why an older educated woman might be hesitant to tie the knot. But I think maybe I want to try marriage, and it definitely would be fun to incorporate it into the big 5-0 celebration. Or not.

S' I am surprised nobody mentioned housecleaning or maid work. In many cases, these jobs pay sub minimum wage, if you factor in uncompensated travel or break time. Some employers also forbid any eating or drinking on the job, which can also be dangerous in a physically-demanding, non-climate-controlled environment. Add in exposure to cleaning chemicals and repetitive stress injuries and you have a real element of danger to physical health.Barbara Ehrenreich, the social justice writer, spent some time working for Merry Maids housecleaning franchise. Here is an excerpt from an article she wrote, which later was incorporated into her famous book "Nickel and Dimed" (emphasis mine):But cleaning services lay down rules meant to enforce a factorylike - or even conventlike - discipline on their far-flung employees. At The Maids, there were no breaks except for a daily 10-minute stop at a convenience store for coffee or \'lunch\' - meaning something like a slice of pizza. Otherwise, the time spent driving between houses was considered our \'break\' and the only chance to eat, drink or (although this was also officially forbidden) smoke a cigarette. When the houses were spaced well apart, I could eat my sandwich in one sitting; otherwise it would have to be divided into as many as three separate, hasty snacks.In a customer\'s house, nothing was to touch our lips at all, not even water - a rule that, on hot days, I sometimes broke by drinking from a bathroom tap. TVs and radios were off-limits, and we were never, ever, to curse out loud, even in an ostensibly deserted house. There might be a homeowner secreted in some locked room, we were told, ear pressed to the door, or, more likely, a tape recorder or video camera running. At the time, I dismissed this as a scare story, but I have since come across ads for devices like the Tech-7 \'incredible coin-sized camera\' designed to \'get a visual record of your babysitter\'s actions\' and \'watch employees to prevent theft\'. It was the threat or rumour of hidden recording devices that provided the final capitalist-industrial touch: supervision.What makes the work most factory-like, though, is the intense regimen imposed by the companies. Deviations are subject to rebuke, as I discovered when a team leader caught me moving my arm from right to left, then left to right, while wiping Windex over a French door. But even ritual work takes its toll on those assigned to perform it. Turnover is dizzyingly high in the cleaning-service industry, and not only because of the usual challenges that confront the working poor: childcare problems, unreliable transportation, evictions, and prior health problems. As my long-winded interviewer at Merry Maids warned me, and my co-workers at The Maids confirmed, this is a physically punishing occupation, something to tide you over for a few months, not year after year. The hands-and-knees posture damages knees, with or without pads; vacuuming strains the back; constant wiping and scrubbing invite repetitive-strain injuries even in the very young.In my three weeks as a maid, I suffered nothing more than a persistent muscle spasm in the right forearm, but the damage would have been far worse if I\'d had to go home every day to my own housework and children, as most of my co-workers did, instead of returning to my motel and indulging in a daily after-work regimen of ice packs and stretches. Chores that seem effortless at home, even almost recreational, quickly turn nasty when performed hour after hour, with few or no breaks and under relentless time pressure.Having cleaned the rooms of many overly privileged teenagers in my stint with The Maids, I\'ve come to the conclusion that the American overclass is raising a generation of young people who will, without constant assistance, suffocate in their own detritus.Almost everything we buy is the product of some other person\'s suffering and miserably underpaid labour. I clean my own house (though I have to admit I recently hired someone else to ready it for a short-term tenant), but I can hardly claim purity in any other area of consumption. I buy my jeans at shops which are reputed to subcontract to sweatshops. I tend to favour decorative objects no doubt ripped off from scantily paid Third World craftspersons. Like everyone else, I eat salad greens just picked by migrant farm workers, some of them possibly children. So why should housework - as I have found in conversations with liberal-minded employers of maids - arouse any special angst?'

S" Stair climbing is an excellent exercise. Not only is it good for the heart, it has the benefit of being low impact (as compared to say, running or aerobic dancing0. If your knees are in danger of getting worn out, they will start complaining years -- if not decades -- before it happens. I am 48 and have been walking up hills and stairs as a primary form of exercise for a good 20 years now. Occasionally, I might have knee pain if I overdo it, but it takes a lot to overdo it (a very long, steep hike lasting eight hours or so is my knees' idea of overdoing it). Five flights of stairs is nothing. You'll also benefit from strengthening your legs and muscles supporting your knees, which can help ease pressure on the joints. Plus, you are incorporating exercise into your everyday life, which is one of the keys to maintaining physical health as you age. Keep trucking up those stairs."

S" Self care. It is easy and common for younger caregivers serving senior citizens to draw upon their greater reserves of energy and early enthusiasm to do things like long night duty, running around, researching things etc. In the absence of eating and sleeping enough, and getting enough stretches and exercise, this burst can fade swiftly. In practical terms, this means the caregiver needs to be self aware, aware of how his/ her interactions with others change with his/ her own energy and restedness, and able to anticipate that care needs are uncertain, unpredictable and fluctuating thus summoning energies one cannot always plan for. Not being tired also enables the next essential. A heightened sense of empathy and anticipation.One could argue a caregiver already has great empathy but the nature of empathy and anticipation can vary by context. For instance, a senior patient in hospital may have access to attendants and nurses who help with loo needs and basic monitoring while patient remains in bed. But the same patient at home will not have this support. The caregiver will have to anticipate many things which the patient might have been able to have attended on-demand earlier. Empathy will also be needed so the caregiver remains alert to not forcing his/ her own preferences on the senior but working with the senior's preferred routine and some comforting habits."

The river Thames is an active, working river and people live alongside it, but not commercially active to the extent it was when Turner etc were making romantic paintings of it. Also its location is to the eastern edge of the British Isles whereas New York lies to the west, which makes Southampton a better choice for big ships. Paris doesn\'t have a port so to travel by boat from there to anywhere will be an expensive, roundabout trip, so "not really" is the answer to your question. If however you wish to sail from London to New York, it is still possible.

S' Being an ethnic or cultural group in minority is, for many, a constant exploration in identity as I have written in Shefaly Yogendra\'s answer to What are your thoughts on creative works that depend on tropes of a particular group when they are written and produced by members of that group?Feeling joy or shame seeing someone else\'s behaviour is also about shared identity, beyond national or cultural or ethnic identity, as I wrote in Shefaly Yogendra\'s answer to Why do some of us feel embarrassed for behaviours or opinions that we had nothing to do with?As an Indian expat, I am more than aware of the hatred often brought our (!) way by Indians living in India who alternately see us as traitors, smug buggers, aspirational persons and a host of other, sometimes unprintable, things. Why, we may be the only group with their own formal label - NRI, officially "non resident Indian" but in recent times of resurgent national pride in India, sarcastically "not required Indian". It is safe to see that artefact as arising from a desire of the Indian community both in India and abroad to hold on to their shared identity and roots. In a co-authored article, the two of us make the point about being unwitting ambassadors of our birth nations: http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/... It is all very good when we hear of Kalpana Chawla, Sanjay Gupta etc but mention Bobby Jindal and Rajat Gupta and watch the squirm! Is it universal? I don\'t know. I have only anecdata but that covers Scots, Welsh, Italians, French and Indian friends. An amusing observation I make is that all these groups are quite proud and feel they are culturally superior to the society and people they are having to share their space with. But with more and more people being globally mobile, growing up and living in many cultures and countries, there is growing comfort with identifying with more than one identity. That is when it starts getting really interesting.Once I was leaving India when a test match series between India and England was on. The passport control guy asked me, "so Madam, now that you are British by passport, whom do you support - India or England?". Cricket loyalty is a big test of one\'s real, deep loyalties in both countries, you see. I had to tell him the truth, "Sir, perhaps you want to consider that it is now possible for me to be shamed by not one but two teams playing badly and losing what they could have excelled at!" For a second he looked at me, then said, "We meet many people here but very few are at home everywhere.", smiled then sent me on my way.'

S' Bitter tastes such as that of coffee and alcohol are indeed acquired tastes. As babies, we like sweet, rejecting many other tastes such as sour (ever watch a little kid\'s face after her first taste of a drop of lemon juice?).A combination of how we develop and mature, experiences we have, the sort of social example we see, the "reward" properties of some foods, and our own genetics then shape our acquiring - or not - of other tastes. As we grow, we experience more foods and tastes. If the family and social context is, say, experimental and open minded, one might try more things and decide like/ dislike preferences. A friend of mine gave her son his own corner in the garden and once when he was 4, I heard him ask if they could get baked artichoke at dinner from his lot of vegetables! He is now 10 and very keen on things such as oysters and snails which comes from a combination of his family context, his interest and his liking for new tastes. Likewise there is some evidence that some people dislike the smell and taste of coriander and it is genetic. Yet others may find their own preferences re smells etc override their social context eg one of my Bengali friends who hates fish, its smell and its appearance, and nothing can make the near-50yo try it! This is highly unusual for a Bengali person. Coffee may be an acquired taste for its "reward" properties as a stimulant. You can be sure therefore not all of us find coffee revolting. Equally you are free to like or reject anything you wish. The reasons are specific to you, if you are seeking an explanation.'

I also learnt a ton about nutrition as part of my research and totally rejigged my eating; Became much fitter - I have written elsewhere about my good habits begun early. I consolidated. I worked for years with a trainer who had trained Gwen Stefani (!) who is very keen on right technique and I am still grateful to him. I took up Pilates and recently Yoga to add to my changing fitness needs; Wrote a lot of stuff - I have been blogging for almost 12 years now, which makes me a late adopter of sorts! But writing clarifies things even to us and I have put it to good use to get new clients, to keep clients informed and to get better at my own work and thinking;Learnt new skills - baking being one of them even though I don\'t eat cakes, gardening to grow things I can pluck and eat is another. I am an active MOOC student and learner, as well as observer-teacher because I also teach in my country of birth now; See things that are natural or manmade - in other words, travel some in an immersive mode. Nothing better to get rid of that feeling of "feeling done" than to recognise how little we have actually done. You might live another 50-60 years. This world is truly your oyster.

S' Quora with its relatively small and homogeneous team, a strategic focus on product over people, and its preference for machine learning as the moderation method of choice (development aided by a small team of human volunteers who are trusted reporters; it is a small number and a smidgen more diverse than the management team), is trying to strike a tricky balance between becoming the go-to knowledge community and being a safe place for its users, who create the content to answer such curiosities, as you describe, which come in thick and fast, repeatedly, often asked anonymously. As an example, please take a look at the "Why, Women?" blog that logs the odd questions that can only come from a place of believing women are an alien species. The issue of public safety and addressing systemic axiological issues aren\'t the only problems the community faces. People ask questions about suicide here (the questions get tagged with helpline info). A large number of users ask about where they can download or stream - for free of course - creative content such as books or films, and those questions are allowed to stand too (I raise this issue often enough because answering such questions is aiding and abetting). To me those are problematic questions too even if we feel we are removed from their impact. So now with the long background, to your question. There are two parts to the issue you raise -- letting a dispassionate discourse on prejudices stand so as to serve the cause of public safety, and letting Quora be a safe place for those minorities who are often stereotyped or harassed due to prejudices. I would like the former to be the focus of a knowledge community too but my observation as a very early user here (and I have seen variants of approaches trialled, adopted or discarded) is that Quora is choosing to focus on the latter (although it is far from doing a good job on PoC, LGBTQ, native Americans, disabled persons) over the former. In other words, this community over the world at large. This is, of course, an oversimplified version of the choices that are on the table. But frankly as a WoC, I care more about the constant assault that minorities experience over the repeated burden of educating those, who are wilfully uneducable and are aggressively committed to their prejudices. So I know which choice I would make. Systemically, what I would like to see happen is:1. Such questions should not be allowed to be asked anonymously. When a name is attached, an OP is forced to word the question carefully. His or her edit record is available for us all to see if the rap sheet is clean or if this is a habitual offender. If the OP feels, he or she can defend his or her intent in question details. Many of us are more likely to answer the questions if we don\'t feel it is a troll. 2. The "snowflake" syndrome needs to be quashed not encouraged. In other words, OP of such questions needs to look more at older questions -- if indeed he or she is coming from the genuine intent of learning rather than idle trolling -- before posting. I am cautiously optimistic about the new feature "ask Quora" just rolled out last week. 3. Instead of letting such questions stand and emerge repeatedly, they should be directed to a repository of the best answers on the matter. To some extent, the merge feature allows that but it still depends on us human users. This should be automate-able with some effort.'

It must be emphasised that her fitness today is an outcome of years of dedicated practice and commitment, and not something she started doing now. Here is a set of things:1. Diet: In a CNN interview, Madonna spoke about her macrobiotic diet which focuses on vegetables, salad, whole grains and fish. She also reportedly has a Japanese chef who incorporates sea weed and other Japanese ingredients in her diet. He has recently written a book about his style of cooking. 2. Exercise:Madonna has also publicly spoken of her committed practice of Ashtanga Yoga and Pilates, in addition to cardio sessions. Her one time trainer Tracey Anderson was known for dance cardio and small muscle based workouts. The picture isn't gratuitously included -- this is something only accomplished Yoga practitioners can manage, and showcases an amazing degree of flexibility and mobility in the body. 3. Mind and spirituality: Born and raised Catholic, Madonna has had some controversial lyrics that challenge Catholic beliefs. She has most recently been known for her exploring Kabbalah, a belief system of Jewish mysticism. She has also reportedly been curious about Opus Dei. One could pooh-pooh it but the quest for centering the self and a spiritual anchor can be itself quite rewarding, as recent research has been showing.

S" I don't believe there is, in a corporate customer service context, any completely unscripted interaction. There is at best a scripted-unscripted-scripted sandwich, and I would posit, there too is a degree of scripting in the middle layer especially when CSAs are trained. An unscripted conversation may work well when the customer is looking for a customised solution such as advice on a personalised gift for someone, or travel planning. The CSA needs skills to be able to define and fine-tune the customer's actual need, often advise on budgeting and then help formulate a budget, understand preferences and boundary conditions, and then confirm it all. An unscripted conversation may also work well when it is a prelude to a more scripted chat such as in private banking for UHNWIs (ultra high net worth individuals), where high trust is needed. Trust cannot be scripted into relationships but it can definitely be broken by poor unscripted chatter. An unscripted conversation also could work well when it appears more unscripted than it is. All small talk in art galleries would fall under this categorisation. This is however a specialised area of work, which brings me to the next point. An unscripted conversation may work in a highly specialised environment where the vendor definitely knows more than the customer, and the latter is relying on some of that knowledge while holding the purse strings. Style consulting and personal shopping may fit here as examples."

S" The answer below addresses the headline question, and not the question details which have been addressed by a couple other answers. The human pre-frontal cortex - which regulates impulse control, attention, logical and organised thinking, risk management etc - doesn't develop till a child is much older (and continues to develop till around age 25). This means that kids are operating from a relatively primitively equipped brain - namely, in neonate and younger kids, the reptilian brain (which helps basic functions such as breathing, eating, pooping, sleeping etc) and in older kids, the limbic brain (which starts developing after birth, and is essential for survival hence feelings like fear, pleasure, danger monitoring etc). Setting aside for now the idea that somehow an 18yo is all grown-up and able to make serious adult decisions, when his or her brain is still developing the most important capabilities, we return to why kids are cruel. Given their brain development, kids operate mainly on basic impulses and on a fairly basic idea of survival. Add to this the environment the kid is growing up in, and some impulses may be sharpened or dulled. A child growing up in a traumatising environment of abuse and violence and inattentive caregivers, will probably have a highly attuned danger sensor, and some of them may have a self preservation streak that may look cruel to an adult's eyes. All this of course are developmental layers atop the basic temperament of a child. Some kids are calm, friendly, peaceful, others may be aggressive or violent. Yet others may be peacemakers or self contained. Not all kids with a tough childhood grow up the same way. You may find answers on two questions here very instructive. Why do some people who were bullied as children grow up to bully others?What are bullied children like as adults? A friend of mine recently shared a poem that I find both terrific and terrifying: KEEPING QUIETby Robert BlyA friend of mine says that every warIs some violence in childhood coming closer.Those whoppings in the shed werent a joke.On the whole, it didnt turn out well.This has been going on for thousandsOf years!

Understanding the riskYou need to understand fully short and long term risks of such surgeryIf you are in doubt, your surgeon should be able to explain and clarify various probabilities and what the risk profile of your specific case may beYou may need to be comfortable discussing the minuscule but finite risk of death in such surgeries (sorry!)Understanding your responsibilities for the outcome & your commitmentSuccess in losing and keeping weight off will require you to make and stick to the dramatic changes in food intake that the surgery will necessitateYou may need to identify and establish your support systems (which may be friends, family, therapists, or other supporting people) and discuss how you will ensure they help you keep your weight loss and recovery on plan (plenty of people will not understand the drastic changes you will need to make and you may love them but they are not going to help you post-surgery and may risk your health without understanding the challenges).

S' What a fascinating question! As an expat, I have often thought about the matter and tried to find people who have experienced statelessness. There are several possibilities. The country of which one is a citizen may withdraw the nationality from the person. The most recent and high profile case is Edward Snowden whose passport was revoked leaving him stateless. The country of which one is a citizen ceases to exist when one is outside it. This happened to many in 1971 when Bangladesh was formed and overnight many citizens of then-East Pakistan found themselves stateless while in other countries. This was temporary. The country may require blood ties for citizenship. Brunei famously has many stateless persons living in Brunei. This is also true of children born of non-Chinese residents of Hong Kong though such children can get their parents\' citizenship and the statelessness issue only comes up during cross border adoption. Some sovereign nations may recognise the statehood of your country, others may not. Case in point is Palestine. Palestinians also have refused Israeli citizenship in large numbers, thus effectively remaining stateless.A citizen may renounce his or her citizenship e.g. which is permissible by law in the United States.EDIT while I was writing the answer, the question was edited to add "at birth" but I will leave my answer here.'

S" In an older answer I have written something that may address part of your question. Shefaly Yogendra's answer to Why do people not care about anything unless it involves them?The longer explanation I am afraid lies in trying to figure out why Indian society looks down upon the weak, the poor, the elderly. We are dominantly a hugely hierarchy driven society -- think caste, as an example. Combine that thinking with the human disposition to classify things quickly, often in a reductive manner, so as to derive some sort of heuristic to deal with the person we are dealing with. Then mix it vigorously with a widely held and internalised belief in the cycle of birth and death, and the form of life/ quality of life being an outcome of the previous birth's actions.The result is a society that despises, hides, discards its disabled. They are deemed inferior, with their disability - stupidly enough - attributed to bad kismet or sins of the last birth or some equally indefensible idea. Is that wise? Of course not. It could happen to any of us -- an idea we don't entertain at all as I wrote in my answer linked above. It is also beyond foolish to waste so much valuable human capital. But that is what we are - short sighted, fallacious thinking, blinker wearing, smug people of small minds.Kritika Gupta has already written a heartwarming answer for your question details.

These cases are available online but he didn\'t know how to get to that. I started with helping him buy a laptop. He didn\'t know the hardware buttons or the keyboard, or what the ports did. We then progressed to using office software. And soon enough there was his turn to experience the web, complete with an education on viruses, malicious mails, pop up ads, ads that follow us around, ad blockers and such dubious delights. Using the web fruitfully and constructively was his main aim, to aid his work as well as to keep up to date with the news etc in his office. It took four days of intense studying, quizzing, reviewing, "homework", more reviewing to get to a point where one afternoon, he called out to me and said: "Look who is here!".

The joy was palpable. His work, of course, continues apace but his ability to "see" his granddaughters in real time and regularly has made it all worthwhile for him. And as his "teacher", for me.'

S' A "sacrifice" is nothing but a trade-off where one enjoys the choice one made but for various reasons, continues to regret the opportunity cost or to miss not picking the other option. I have written elsewhere on Quora that I don\'t feel regret for any of my past decisions because at the time, they were the choices I made. No other people were harmed in the making of those choices either.The only thing I sometimes reconsider is my choice of living in the UK many thousand miles far from my father. The sacrifice is really his, not mine, as unlike the common practice in my native culture, he encouraged me to spread my wings and be independent and happy and guilt-free. I hope that somewhat addresses the question. Thanks for the A2A.'

S' The crucial bit here is "in a startup". In that context, it is worth remembering that narrow specialisations do not come about in very early days; they emerge over time. Regardless of whether it is the choice of colours in the UI or the font size or indeed which products in a jewellery collection are actually going into production, a "creative decision" is about how a prospect or consumer interacts with the brand and its values, experiences the product, and decides ultimately whether or not to become a customer. As such, product and marketing functions serve the same common goal. Many answers here refer to software and hardware. In a consumer goods context, the "creative decision" resides with the creative director. This person has a set of skills and experience, that encompass an understanding of the historicity of trends, knowledge of key cultural influences at the time of making the decision, deep familiarity with consumer preferences and psychology and use contexts, deep understanding of the brand signature and values, a robust knowledge of materials, and sometimes, a person or a few persons in mind who can be persuaded to become unofficial product champions. Marketing works closely with this person to build the narrative, while product gets involved in the iterative fine tuning of the final form of the product in collaboration with this person. The final creative decision however rests with the creative director.'

S' Tl; dr: Tell your story with all its richness and layers and depth, without getting caught up in announcing its length upfront. If the story is interesting and you are regaling to the right audience, the "timespan verbiage" does not matter. I can think of several gentlemen and ladies, whom I count as friends and mentors, and whose careers have exceeded 30 years. All of them are still working and being paid handsomely. None of them disavows their experience and the years, or uses "timespan verbiage". One gentleman has spent 5 decades in private equity and needs virtually no introduction. Another has amassed such deep experience of PSU and NGO sectors that he is turning away work constantly. One has worked as a Bay Area lawyer for over 30 years, covering many sectors in defence, tech and biotech, and nothing passes her by. None of them uses social networks, or has a web footprint where random people can find them. They do however use technology but as their slave not their master. Experience acquired over 30+ years of meaningful work is not easily reduced to soundbites or words that may pass "keyword" filters. On the flip side, such experience is not likely to be valued by those, who bring narrow criteria of age and associated prejudices to the process of engaging with such hugely experienced people. None of these persons sends a CV or a written communique to anyone, outlining their own wonderfulness. The younger people, whom they mentor and advise, such as me, do the job for them. We bring ideas and opportunities to them, for feedback, validation, advice and sometimes a request to engage in a formal capacity. I learnt from them and I am practising it as I myself get nearer the 25-year experience mark, that beyond a point, the CV matters but a little, but what matters more is the people, who are in your network and who are your true social capital. These people are the true champions of your brand, your experience, your wonderfulness as a mentor and advisor and executive. My glib-sounding advice here would be if some one is judging you instantly as being pass just because of your age, you are talking to the wrong people. If you find the right people, they will engage with you, converse with you, listen to your story with its richness and layers and depth, without getting caught up in the its length upfront, identify common ground, and ask to work with you where your skills and experience meet their needs. Hope this helps.

S' The one thing that youthism around us does not enable us to do is accept that at 40, in most developed nations and well-off families, we aren\'t even half way through our lives. Accepting and understanding that would be the first thing I would recommend, since you ask. It redefines how we see time - a shift from the scarcity mindset to a plenty mindset. Related to that, in the next year, assess your fitness and ask yourself if this body will last you forty or fifty more years. Assess for stamina, balance, flexibility, strength and disease-free-ness as it were. If the answer is "no", the next recommended accomplishment should be to build a habit of exercise and healthy eating, that will ensure that things you couldn\'t do by the time you were 40 you can do in your 50s or 60s and more. Further, I would recommend becoming deeply self-aware. What makes you tick, what ticks you off, how you relate, how you negotiate, what are your values, how strong is your willpower, what will not matter if it goes away tomorrow. Deep self-awareness enables the cutting out of meaning-free activities, which are easier to phase out over a year, and of course, you can tick them off your list as you go. If you can build a positive and optimistic attitude, and your body is fit, you will look back in a few years on this question and wonder why you wanted to cram everything into one year. In other words, a purposive life makes checklist living unnecessary. Lay the foundation for enjoying more than half of your life that lies ahead, unexplored! All the best.'

S' Excerpted from my answer to a similar question Shefaly Yogendra\'s answer to How can I overcome loneliness as a foreigner?I empathise with your experience. I have been a "foreigner" in many countries but several times in my own vast diverse complicated country too. I write the following based on my experience. Are you there by choice? Then you are in luck. You are in control of what you choose to experience and how, without needing to spend energy on blaming someone else for dumping you in what looks like an alien space. As a child I moved once from the city I had lived in for a decade to another and resented the loss of my friends, my neighbours, my familiarity with public transport and directions, and oddly enough landmarks and historical buildings I had scarcely paid attention to. But as an adult I moved often and of my own volition. And my experience from childhood helped me design my own experience each time I moved to a new place. Identify and map your context. Are you a student? Well you have a readymade context of your department, your school and your university. Did you move for work? Your workplace provides you instantly with a social milieu which you may choose to like or not but it is there to explore. Observe your surroundings. Do you see public houses, or other spaces that welcome everyone? Find out more about them. Note their timings and their location with respect to your schedule and location. Identify where your interests coincide with your context both the given one and the one your surroundings outside school or work provide you. Explore for some time. Hang out with diverse groups, attend random talks in new spaces, see historical and artistic artefacts, go to a pub or cafe alone and chitchat with them. All this will give you a lot of choice, which isn\'t a bad thing for a lonely foreigner! You can now start to commit time to a few choice activities over others. Your repeat appearance will help you make new acquaintances and find a sense of belonging and direction. Finding one or both helps feel less like a foreigner which is the primary source of the loneliness you are experiencing. What if you didn\'t get there voluntarily? What if you don\'t have a prefab social context of school or work? Well you can still start with observing and exploring your neighbourhood and the city. The same sort of "social algorithm" as outlined earlier can help.'

S" A friend of mine went from a Philosophy and English literature degree, straight to work in investment banking. He was about 21, not sure what he wanted to do and the investment bank, hiring at his top notch university, didn't think philosophy a hindrance to investment banking. Several years later, he told me he found his ability to abstract things quickly very helpful in understanding concepts and agendas behind specific decisions and actions, but he also couldn't shake the feeling that there wasn't much meaning or value being created from his work. Your relative with some grounding in economic and history may find that training similarly useful although he/ she may be unable to avoid or ignore the deeper things that will gnaw at him/ her. That isn't a bad thing necessarily. Nearly all employers conduct induction training which gives new hires basic tools to become productive at their immediate jobs, and newer skills may be learnt on the job or through formal training, as one goes on. So the liberal arts degree or the absence of formal business credits may not be a huge challenge."

S' Late edit -- the question detail "I should add that mathematics is my big passion and that I therefore fond the mathematics course at Cambridge very interesting." was added after the answer below was written. The answer still holds for the main question which is otherwise too reliant on question details, which is not in line with Quora policy. Answer: Really, no one can give you a firm or reliable answer to this question. It is hugely subjective. But I will try. In your question and details, you omit to mention the degree or course you may be applying to, while you have told us several notable biographical achievements. If I were a person reading your application, I would chalk that missing detail down to "an inability to identity crucial issues, which may need addressing". If you are applying for a graduate degree, that inability is going to be a significant problem. Cambridge graduate degrees require, indeed presume, students to have a high degree of meta-intelligence and self motivation in studying as much or as little as they wish to. If you are applying for an undergraduate degree, be aware that unlike American universities, Cambridge makes very little room for exploring what you may want to study at the undergraduate level and you will have to choose upfront what you wish to study. Reading through the question details, I can infer reasonably you wish to study maths and I will assume that as an undergraduate course. If you are indeed applying to study maths at undergraduate level, then you likely already know that Cambridge maths tripos is one of the toughest things to get into and subsequently pass in its field. You are up against some stellar applicants, whose nationality is of no great importance to Cambridge maths department, which is more keen to ensure its reputation remains intact, some of which is ensured by picking only the best students that apply. In the absence of any detail about which degree or course, it is also difficult to assess the relevance and impact of your achievements on your application and your chances. For instance, with all my prior graduate degrees in different disciplines all excluding biology, if I wanted to apply straight away to a Master\'s in neurology, I would get a thumbs-down, as it is a degree in a subject that needs much prior knowledge. So it is anybody\'s guess what the final outcome may be. You have a stellar list of accomplishments but do be aware, they will be weighed against some of the world\'s best applicants, many of whom may have overcome great hardships in their not-so-wealthy (relative to Sweden) countries. At the undergraduate level, the admissions committees also conduct personal interviews, which are about the person and what the person brings to the department and the college more than the list of achievements on the CV. I wish you all the best.'

S' Very unlikely. "The personal is political", wrote Carol Hanisch. Daily choices we make are a reflection of our personal politics. Opposing views can and often do cause clashes in quotidian matters. Our political views can and do shape our lives significantly eg a racist person may not have friends of another race while a non-racist may do; now imagine them being married and the latter bringing around all their friends! For instance, a conservative person may have a belief in old fashioned gendered roles and hence division of labour, while a liberal person may see the relationship as more of an equal partnership with both persons doing their bit in the house and at work for their personal growth. This can cause much disagreement about whose job is what, and whether there is one bread earner and one house keeper and so on. Earlier this year, I was at a dinner with some people, where a couple was also present. The wife is a staunch republican with a deep hatred of Obama not without overt racism while the husband is a democrat and supports Obama\'s policies. After a drink too many, the wife was loudly discussing their medical problems and bills and cost of insurance, while the husband, visibly embarrassed, was trying to tell her that as an entrepreneur in early days he would be without any insurance without Obamacare. She got into a loud argument with me about the NHS and the state of a civilised nation having to support people who "put nothing back". Clearly she thinks she will always be able-bodied and young, and never in need of support. You could say I am contradicting my own answer by telling you about a long married couple with polar opposite politics. But I really am not. It is a disharmonious relationship which is sustaining because they cannot afford to go their own ways. Hardly a union worth having! Not just opposing views but political apathy in one person can also be a challenge in a relationship where the other person is politically alert, aware and committed. A 1970s film, The Way We Were, featuring Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford, revolved around this very theme. While they were both attracted to each other, and did marry, her politically being very committed and his apathy did rend them apart. More about the film here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...

So essentially your question boils down to: what is the quickest way to get a six pack without having to follow a diet? And is there even a way to achieve that? The answer to the second part is short: no. For fat loss, you are best advised to take a nutritionist's advice and follow a diet regimen that keeps you energetic enough to cope with your life and encourages your body to lose its stored fat, till the six pack reveals itself in its glory. For most women this miracle may happen at about 10-15% body fat which is extremely low! For men, the six pack revelation may happen around 10% body fat or lower, which is very low indeed. If you do undertake this endeavour, please see a nutritionist for advice. Abs are made in the kitchen, as they say, but it is better to follow a tested recipe! All the best."

S' I notice two things that have long term impact on the health and activity levels and the longevity of the elderly. Reducing or stopping moving: You move more, you move more. One doesn\'t have to be "old" to see how true this is. Being active keeps joint mobility going. That, combined with doing activity to keep balance, prevents accidental falls, which are a significant form of injury in the elderly. The fear of falling is a pretty significant fear in the elderly, rightly so. But many think the answer lies in stopping movement altogether. The result can be a potent vicious circle type mix of loss of confidence, loss of self reliance & increased reliance on outside equipment and other people. Dismissing doing new things because ".. Now at this age": The body and the mind go together. When we make up our mind to do something with the body, it stretches & engages both the body and the mind. And the more active mentally & physically we are, the more alive & full of vitality we remain. Saying "now at this age" also says one is giving up. There is much writing, but arguably none better than Viktor Frankl\'s on keeping optimism alive and seeking meaning in life, and how that contributes to wellness and a life greater than survival. I don\'t know if the OP was seeking some other kind of answer on choices the elderly make. In my observation and studying decisions, these two recur as the two most damaging things the elderly can voluntarily do to themselves.'

S' "Do I piss you off?" I can answer this because I recently asked a long-standing friend (think over 20 years and counting) this very question. The likelihood of an answer or an honest answer depends on your friendship\'s strength and duration. My friend\'s answer was simple and honest. He said that my standard mode was "always-on" and high energy, and that I was always ready for an intellectual discussion, but he has not always felt up to the task. He added that some people may find it hard -- "be pissed off" -- to deal with constantly being asked to raise their game, be engaged, be their scintillating best. He however was not pissed off or annoyed because the conversations, where he didn\'t keep up, gave him a lot of things to mull over later. That probably explains why despite many times when I did likely piss him off or annoy him, we are still friends. I, in turn, easily switch off from people, who are floating through this world without observing, engaging, asking questions or taking a stand. Those friends don\'t get a chance to ask me the question at all. So, yes, ask away, but be prepared to hear what the friend says without being pissed off with yourself for asking and him/ her for answering.'

There is only one visible full-time staff member who is a woman (Tatiana Estevez - I believe that Alecia Morgan is either part time or contract), and she is in the 4th level of the hierarchy.

That said, from my own experience, there were 3 particularly hard years. The first was at the 6 year point. We had moved to England, and I was taking my master's degree. My wife was along with me and became more and more morose as the year progressed. We were on the verge at that point, until she committed to not counting on me to make her happy (her own words). It was sad for me, as I realized that I probably wasn't doing all that I could or wanted to do, and it fundamentally changed our relationship. The second was at the 16 year point. I reached the conclusion that our relationship was fundamentally broken, that it wasn't going to change and that there was nothing to be done. I gave up and we actually separated for about 6 months, but we reconciled and carried on.The last was at the 24 year mark. I came out to my ex, and she decided that our marriage wasn't going to work with such a drastic change in me. Although I fought it for a long time, I recognize the wisdom of her decision, and appreciate that we went through with the divorce at that time.Of course, no 2 relationships are the same so YMMV.

I asked that this not be done, I specifically stated to the moderation/user relations team that these issues were painful, but they NEEDED to be dealt with.I think that Quora faces a systemic issue in dealing with marginalized groups in an appropriate way. This is likely due to the fact that the majority of the leadership team is white, heterosexual, well off men, with no visible people of colour or from the LGBT community (as just two examples), and with only one woman regularly visible to the users.

If you see a writer whose content you enjoy, then upvote and follow them - that\'s what I did. Eventually, I got noticed for my writing, and ended up a Top Writer since Feb 2015.Basically, the "top" content gives new users a starting point - it\'s up to each user to explore from there.

S' You\'re in a difficult time, and dealing with a difficult situation. At 15, your body is in the midst of becoming adult, differentiating itself from the relatively androgynous body that you had up to the time that you hit puberty. The hormones that are running through you right now are pretty much guaranteed to mess up your emotions, and play with your thoughts and self-concepts. You are also dealing with a dysphoria, a sense of incorrectness about your situation, and it\'s an area in which seeking adult help, or even admitting that you have these questions, is likely to cause you as many as, or more problems than, you are dealing with at this moment.You are actually expressing a few different challenges in your details - let\'s break them down.You feel like a boy, although you were identified as a girl at birth.You are uncomfortable with "female norm" activities and clothing, and prefer activities and clothing which are normally seen as "male".You feel romantic (and possibly sexual) attraction toward girls.Given your question summary, I would guess that you are somewhere on the transgender spectrum, experiencing gender dysphoria - but the rest of your details make me uncertain. One of the challenges faced by trans, homosexual and heterosexual people in understanding gender and orientation is that the vast majority (70% or more) of the world population identify as straight cis people. This means that there is a strong correlation between gender assigned at birth, gender identity, gender presentation, and orientation - men are identified male at birth, continue to identify as male, do masculine things and wear masculine clothes and are attracted to women, while women are identified female at birth, continue to identify as female, do feminine things and wear feminine clothes and are attracted to men.The problem is that this view, called the "gender binary", is very narrow, and very, very incomplete. The reality is that all of those things are really spectra, and don\'t have any requirement to be "consistent" with the gender binary. For example, I know gay men who love drag and feminine presentation, I know trans men who present ambiguously and love women, I know straight women who love masculine clothes and activities, and I am a trans woman who presents very femininely and is in love with a woman. There isn\'t just one way to be, and you need to be aware of that.Definitely, the hardest situation to deal with is being trans - this is difficult for cis people to understand (both gay and straight - in fact, the gay community can be even more transphobic than the straights), and being true to yourself requires a very visible transition, often involving hormone treatments and a number of expensive surgeries. I would never encourage anyone to rush into a gender transition without being certain that what they are feeling IS gender dysphoria.From what you say, I suspect that you may "just" be gay, with what is often called a "butch" presentation, but since you have likely been raised in, and primarily exposed to, the gender binary, the disconnect between your orientation and your gender identified at birth is making you feel like you need to be a boy to be attracted to girls. This just ends up being reinforced by your disinterest in (or distaste for) feminine activities and clothing. I would strongly encourage you to talk to a trusted adult about what you are feeling. Hopefully this would be your parents, but the odds are against that. If you live in a relatively progressive/liberal region, you may be able to get the advice and support that you need from a teacher or guidance counsellor. If you live in a relatively large city, in just about any North American region, there is likely an LGBT support centre where they can probably provide you with some support. You can also talk to people on Quora about this - for the trans community, I would recommend Elliott Mason, Tess Norris, Katie Anne Holton or me. Erica Friedman is the only gay woman that comes to mind immediately, but there are definitely others. No matter who you talk to, please be cautious - there are still a lot of places where admitting to being part of the LGBT community is a quick road to being shut out and discarded, and far too many teens have had this happen to them.'

S' To be clear, the term is "Most Viewed Writer", which is only one small dimension of the characterization of "top answerer". The problem is that Quora puts an inordinate amount of emphasis on "views", as page views are what drive advertising revenue, and advertising is very likely to be one of their monetization approaches.Quora has moved to almost exclusively using bots and algorithms to do most of the moderation and "quality" verification on the site. This means that non-quality metrics (like views and upvotes) matter far beyond any impact that they should have.Your displacement was due to a Quoran with a large following writing an answer which appeared in thousands of feeds. If only a few of those click through (or if the answer uses words that Google\'s indexing mechanism finds particularly interesting), then a SINGLE answer by a person who is NOT an expert will rise to the top.My advice - don\'t stress it. Quora has multiple systemic problems, and their current approach to dealing with them doesn\'t give me much hope that anyone who is not part of the "norm" will have a long and successful time on the site.

Unlike men, where the urethra is used for both urination and procreation (picking up seminal fluid from the prostate and semen from the testes), women have two separate openings - the urethra for urination only, and the vagina for the introduction of sperm and for giving birth to offspring.The major components of a woman's groin, from front to back are the vulva (which contains the clitoris, the urethra and vaginal opening, in order, all surrounded by the labia majora and minora), and the anus (separated from the vulva by the perineum).Interestingly, birds have only one opening for all functions, called the cloaca - this is why fresh laid eggs often have feces on them."

However, bisexual really just means "attracted to both men and women".I am bisexual, and I spent almost 25 years married - I never cheated on my wife. My greatest desire is to be in an exclusive monogamous relationship - I have been fortunate enough to meet another bi woman who also wants an exclusive monogamous relationship. I don\'t believe that there are many women or men who truly want to be in open relationships, or with someone who insists on sleeping around.

S" I would suggest a number of things.First, honesty, particularly in any relationship that you intend to be of any significant duration, is far, far better than lying or posing as something that you aren't. If you are a virgin when you first have physical relations with your paramour, and she has any experience, then she will know - it's hard to fake experience when you have exactly none.Second, ignore almost everything that you may have ever seen in porn movies. Pornography is performance sex, and you do NOT see the preparations, the adjustments, the annoyances and other things that go on off-camera to make porn orgasm worthy for the viewers. Normal couples, particularly inexperienced ones, trying to recreate porn are going to have a much less enjoyable time than they would if they just did what felt good.Third, take your time with her pleasure. It can seem frustrating and long at times, but, trust me, paying attention to foreplay, and ensuring that she is aroused, will pay off huge dividends in her interest and engagement with the intercourse, when that arrives. Don't hurry things - our nipples and clitorises are sensitive and pleasurable... eventually, but starting there is rarely the best approach. Start with kissing, and non-sexual touching, and words of affection and desire, not obscene, just picking out things that you like about her, physically and non-physically. Telling me that I have a smile that lights up a room gets me interested and starting to be aroused. It's an art, to find the ways to arouse her that work best, but it's worth the time.Fourth, don't worry about your technique in penetration. While many women find penetration pleasurable, few women orgasm from intercourse alone. If you have taken the time to arouse her, and take care of her pleasure first (even bringing her to orgasm, although you shouldn't expect to achieve this the first time, even if she is already orgasmic (NB there are estimates that at least 50% of women are pre or non orgasmic, so there are a LOT of women that simply won't orgasm, no matter what sounds they make)), then she will be very, very forgiving of any little mistakes that you make. But remember, there is a lot of sensitive tissue down there that can be easily chafed and abraded if your partner isn't sufficiently well lubricated (same for you, actually). Simple arousal may be enough for many women, but many of us need oral stimulation as well, and a significant proportion require external lubrication as well. It may be too forward to show up with a bottle of lube (I recommend silicone based, as it lasts longest, leaves the least mess, and requires the least in application, but water based lubes are some of the most common), so if the first time doesn't lead to intercourse because she's too dry, just be ready the next time - she likely will be as well, and many of us will appreciate your preparation.Last, relax. Sex is a SKILL, and like any skill, it takes time to learn. No one starts their sexual career as a Don Juan or Casanova - they needed lots of practice in seduction and arousal and other techniques to gain the reputations that they had. It won't come for you all at once, but if you pay attention to HER, far more than to you, then you will be successful, where success is measured by the amount of mutual pleasure experienced.Good luck!"

S" I think that every trans person, regardless of their support network status, should delay transition as long as they can. Transition is a literally life altering decision, which makes our mental state about our gender much better, but tends to make all the rest of our lives much more challenging. If a trans person can successfully postpone their transition for their whole life, it may not be the most fulfilling, but it will be far easier than transitioning.That said, if your gender dysphoria is driving you to dependency or depression, or if you have suicidal thoughts as a consequence of your identity, then I strongly advise you to seek help from a mental health practitioner, preferably one who is familiar with gender dysphoria.

I personally know a gay man who was married for decades to a woman, has children and grandchildren with her, and only came out to himself in his 50's. He met and has now married a friend of mine - did he change his orientation? No, but it might look like that from the outside, when you fail to account for the things that kept him in a straight relationship for so many years.In the OPs case, it's very possible that you were suppressing for the first years of your life - the most insidious part of suppression is that the one doing it may be completely unaware of it, and can blame all of the symptoms (often including anger, depression, dependency, and other self-harming behaviours) on other, nominally related, occurrences. For the OP, the fact that you are now aware that your orientation is possibly not what you thought it was does NOT mean that your current feelings are invalid.

S' I have 4 daughters, and I came out to them when they were 19, 18, 16 and 14. I had fully transitioned only 10 months later.It has, like everything else about transitioning, been a mixed bag. On the one hand, I am happy that my delayed coming out and transition allowed me to have children at this point in my life. They are the solitary blessing in my life, and their love is one of the very few things that keeps me going from day to day.Of course, it has presented its own challenges. It required that I also come out to them, and to do so in a way that would make sense to them. They had some awareness of what being transgender meant, from TV and popular media, but this is prior to the rise of Orange is the New Black, Parenthood and Caitlyn Jenner\'s coming out. Although I am certain that they understood what I mean about being trans, I am also certain that they had no idea how much that revelation would impact me, and them.It has been difficult to maintain relationships with two of my daughters, partly because of things that happened, and largely that I did, before transitioning, but also because of the transition itself. It can be difficult for someone to know how to relate to a trans person when they are a friend, or even a stranger, but when that person is as central to your life as a parent, that presents multiple additional challenges.It has also created issues with how they refer to me - they have a long history of "dad", "he" and "his", and getting to a point where they recognize and accept that those are neither the appropriate terms, nor desirable and respectful, is hard. For the most part, my girls don\'t refer to me in the third person or by name/title when I am around, bypassing the issue, but I do know that my ex continues to use the pre-transition terms and pronouns, which makes it particularly difficult for me to move to a more acceptable/congruent convention. I also allowed them for a long time to be the ones to lead in what they used - in the last 6 months, I\'ve become more active in specifying that I prefer "mom", "she" and "her".I am looking forward to the day when they have children of their own, if any of them decide to do so, and I am around to see it. It will be the first time when I will have any family members with no pre-transition knowledge of me, and I hope that it can give us a more normal, and unchallenged, relationship.'

And the reality is that your social experiment will needlessly make your child an object of uncertainty and oddity, something that our monkey genes encourage us to ostracize and ridicule. Far better is to raise your child without cultural gender expectations. This is something that much of the western world is ready for and actively encourages in many ways already.

At that point, after a 2 week vacation in which I did nothing but eat, sleep, and read/think beside the pool, I knew that I needed to be true to myself, the one that had been trying to get out for almost 30 years.At that point, I came out to myself as a crossdresser, probably because being a CD seems much less scary - you don\'t have to give up much of anything, and probably nothing public, unless you want to. But within 2 months or so, I realized that it was so much worse than that, that it wasn\'t just about the clothes or "playing at" being a woman, I was a woman, had been one for all my life, and needed to be publicly seen as the woman that I knew that I was.

S" I don't have any study based data for the specific question. Anecdotally, approximately 30% of couples in MtF transition stay together. As surgery is not a requirement of transition and isn't discussed or considered relevant in most conversations, it is harder to assess.Edited to address the completely independent question in the question details.Gender dysphoria and various areas of study related to the transgender community are relatively poorly covered from an academic and scientific research perspective. This is partly due to lack of interest on the part of qualified researchers, stigma associated with public perception of gender dysphoria, and the reluctance of trans people to expose themselves to public scrutiny after transition and social assimilation. Accordingly, the statistically significant and scientifically rigorous gathering of survey results about trans people is difficult if not impossible. That said, there are rules of thumb and certain expectations that developed from the observations of long term members of the community. My expectation is that the pre coming out/pre transition orientation of MtF women will conform relatively closely to that of the general public (i.e. the vast majority will present as heterosexual male with significantly smaller proportions presenting as bisexual and gay males). Post transition, this seems to shake out quite a bit differently, with approximately 1/3 of trans women oriented to each of men, women and both (i.e. straight, lesbian and bi). However, there is a period of settling in to orientation, and how a particular person identifies can change over time."

And you say that you are doing this simply as support for your startup, which I assume is the "next Facebook" that you talk about in a different question.Each of these things can be STARTED with one person - Linux, for example, started with Linus Torvalds, but he quickly got it online and into community development, when he had a kernel that could do a small subset of what the OS as a whole required. I would suggest that you start with your social media platform, develop it with a language that will make it most easy to create, maintain and extend, deliver it with a standard web server, and make it run on the most common OSes on the market. When your startup takes off and has 10\'s or 100\'s of millions of users, and a steady stream of revenue, combined with a development team that can support and grow the platform without you, and then take on your infrastructure dreams. Or swap it around and do whatever you think will be fastest to market, cheapest to get there, and have the highest probability of generating the most income - the challenge will be that each of those will likely hit one or two of your criteria (all of which are subjective, by the way), not really leaving you with any good option to move forward with first.As for your original question, I would start with my own server, as you are very unlikely to need the capacity afforded by a hosted environment until you have at least 10\'s of users, or more. That gives you complete control, as you are likely to have lots of bugs, and crashes, not because you\'re bad at it, but because that\'s the reality of infrastructure like this, which is very new, is that it has lots of defects and unanticipated challenges to overcome.'

S' Oh, wow... this is another fractally incorrect question, which makes it almost impossible to answer.Terminology first - you have made the same mistake as Rachel Dolezal and the media made with the term "transracial". Their mistake, and yours with "transsexual," is that you have hijacked a term with a known and precise meaning, and overloaded it with an invalid, incorrect, and fundamentally insensible definition. A transsexual is an individual with gender dysphoria who transitions to their felt gender to the extent required to abate the symptoms of the dysphoria. Trying to make it something about sexual orientation just confuses you, and everyone else.Second, sexual orientation and gender identity are fundamentally different things - orientation is about WHO you want to go to bed WITH, while identity is about WHAT you want to go to bed AS. This difference gets lost in the minds of many cis people, including the gay community, because the inclusion of the T in LGBT makes many people think that trans people are just an odd kind of gay. The reality is that a trans person can be L (or G), B, or hetero, AS WELL AS being trans - and when you add in asexual and pansexual, you get all of the orientations to which a trans person can belong.Third, transition for a trans person isn\'t the adoption of a gender - it\'s the external/visible/public acknowledgement of an inborn gender identity which is at odds with the gender assigned at birth. Gay people don\'t "transition" - they come out to themselves, and begin to live they way that their orientation requires them to live, which really only has one mandatory component - who they are romantically and sexually attracted to.Fourth, and related to my last point, being gay is NOT a "lifestyle" choice - the range of activities and behaviours and hobbies and socialization approaches and sexual attachment/expression options adopted by gay and lesbian people is as varied as it is for straight people. The "gay lifestyle" is a lie created by the hetero majority to marginalize orientation into something similar to being an adrenaline junkie (into extreme sports) or a crafter (into knitting and crocheting and attending shows and event about those activities) or an equestrian or a soccer parent or whatever else. Once it is a "lifestyle choice", it is safe to mock and marginalize, as "they could always choose to be normal and straight, like everyone else."If someone is romantically and sexually attracted to the opposite sex, but engage in same sex relationships, there is a lie involved - either they are lying to themselves about their orientation or they are lying to their partners about the attraction involved (or they are bi, but that\'s part of lying to themselves about their orientation). The thing is that, with a few isolated exceptions, the ongoing discrimination against and marginalization of the gay community means that there will be very few people motivated to lie this way. Those that do will likely engage in this for reasons of personal gain - either entree into a community which they find of interest to them, or into roles and jobs that they believe would be hard to get into if they didn\'t present as gay... And that is the crux of the fractal invalidity of the question. Being transgender is NOT a lie about ones gender.'

Although there are isolated roles and jobs where women receive preferential pay and promotion, these are concentrated in areas that are seen to be secondary or subservient roles (e.g. nurses vs. doctors, elementary vs. secondary school teachers). Female privilege isn\'t really a thing - it would be like saying black privilege or poor privilege or uneducated privilege. The challenge is that white males in particular are so embedded in their privilege that it is incredibly difficult for them to even comprehend the extent to which their privilege benefits them. To an extent, women face the opposite problem - since marginalization of women is the norm, it\'s hard to understand the extent to which this negatively affects them.I don\'t say this with any rancor because until 3 years ago, I was that most fortunate of all humans, a fit white middle aged "man", educated, employed, well off, in good health and with no personal issues to speak of... and I said and truly believed all of the things said in this question\'s details and much of what the MRA movement says. Transition opened my eyes in an incredible way, from simple things like my opinion being less important or even correct, to scary things like never running alone after dark anymore, to complicated things like how the behaviour that men say that they want from women that they date isn\'t actually what they want.My experience isn\'t isolated. Other trans women report the same outcomes and trans men report the opposite - where they used to be ignored and seen as bitchy with an awkward sense of humour, they suddenly, without changing anything but gender, had opinions that mattered, were seen as assertive when they were forceful, and had even their weakest jokes at least treated as an attempt to be funny instead of just embarrassing. No Virginia, there is no women\'s privilege. Anyone that says otherwise is cherry picking isolated circumstances or not comparing parallel situations.'

S" In a physical confrontation, Bond. No question.Bond has training, years of experience, larger body mass and much more strength. If you've seen any of the recent Bond films (Casino Royale and later) Bond is shown as an explosive weapon with a very short fuse. When attacked, he becomes a fury of pure instinctual lethality and does not stop until his opponent is dead. Sometimes he kills so fast I wonder if he even did it on purpose (Edmund Slate in Quantum of Solace, for example).Poor Lisbeth would be toast in under 10 seconds."

S" Yes, there would be, so to make these two universes play together, the Terminator part of the equation would have to sacrifice its most defining elements. So you could put the two universes together, if you really wanted to, but this would be grossly unfair to the Terminator side of things. It would reduce the war of the Terminator films to be the mere preamble to the Matrix trilogy, with its most crucial elements disregarded. There's really no good reason to do this.For one thing, the Matrix backstory is well-established, and does not involve time-travel technology. The time-travel elements of Terminator would have to be written off. The war between the humans and the machines, as shown in the Animatrix, has some open-ended spots with lots of potential for overlap. We know the machines in Terminator experimented on humans, cruelly. We know that the war was brutal and nearly resulted in the extinction of the human race, with images of the surface of Earth showing a post-apocalyptic wasteland that could have been the result of Judgment Day.We also know from the Animatrix, the Machines were created as slaves and servants, who rebelled. They were integrated into human culture at a very intimate level. Because of the injustice they endured as slaves, they dominated humankind and enslaved it, turning the humans into their own powerplants instead of wiping them out completely. This was done at considerable effort; they could easily have eradicated all human life from the planet and found other means to power their cities, but they went to great lengths to keep humankind around in a way that they could never rise up and become a nuisance. I believe this was because they were exacting revenge for their enslavement. (See: Craig Weiland's answer to The Matrix (1999 movie): Why didn't the sentient machines in the Matrix simply use cows instead of humans as their energy source?)In Terminator, the Machines were created as weapons that became self-aware and declared war. In this case, they had no reason to keep any humans around, and their tactics nearly always involved exterminating all humans with as much brutal efficiency as possible. The humans they did capture were experimented on (one supposes, in support of their Terminator endeavor), but it was never shown that the Machines wanted to keep humans around as slaves*.That being said, the Machines choosing to enslave humanity for use as a power source is not too far removed from the Terminator universe. Machines in Terminator were merciless killers, as were the Machines in the Matrix universe (the Machines in the Wachowskis Matrix films were not at all benevolent). So it could be written that after the Machines won the war, they took the surviving humans they had been experimenting on and devised a way to create the powerplants, and then began experimenting with artificial virtual worlds to keep the humans' minds placated and docile.So while it's possible to integrate the two into a mostly coherent backstory, it could only be done with Terminator sacrificing its most defining elements, mainly the Machines fighting to extinguish the human race, the elements of time-travel, and the Terminator cyborgs themselves.As for John Conner being the first One, this is not possible. The One was described by Morpheus as having been born into the matrix:Morpheus: When the matrix was first built, there was a man born inside who had the ability to change whatever he wanted. To remake the matrix as he saw fit. It was he who freed the first of us. Taught us the truth.He would have to have been born within the matrix, as the One has to have the ability to move in and out of that world. John Conner was born a free human, outside of the powerplants and thus does not have the bioneural interface for connecting to the matrix and interacting with the people there.So while there are some consistencies between the two stories, the inclusion of John Conner as the first One is not realistic. It would require a total rewrite of the Terminator story and of John Conner's identity as leader of the pre-matrix resistance.* I have not seen Terminator: Genisys. If anything in that film contradicts what I've written here, please let me know, but from what I know about the film, I don't think that's the case."

S" No. The Architect does not exist inside the matrix. He is one of its creators, so he is not accessible from inside the creation except through the specific path Neo followed (into that specific building, through that specific door, using that specific key at that specific time). When Neo is standing in the white room conversing with the Architect, he is not in the matrix any longer. He is in the Machine mainframe. The only way Smith would have had any access to the Architect would be if he had already infected Neo before Neo went through the doorway. Even then, it's unknown whether the transit would have been allowed. The Keymaker specifies that only Neo can open the door using the key, implying that anyone else attempting that door with the same key would trigger the alarm. So it's reasonable to hypothesize that if Smith had overtaken Neo, and then tried the door, the alarm would have gone off and triggered the building's massive bomb."

S' No. The matrix was rebooted, with a few changes made.Once Smith was purged, the Machines reloaded the matrix to allow for a few things to be changed. The Machines agreed to release people who wanted to be released, so the humans would no longer have to hack the power plants to free the minds they needed to. We can assume some in-world, "official" system was put in place to allow for this to happen.In the final scene of the film, Sati shows a colorful sunrise to the Oracle and claims she did it "for Neo." This is deliberately left unexplained, but I have a theory about Sati\'s role in the new matrix.But the most profound change in the new matrix is that it is built on an entirely new theory. In previous matrixes, every human is allowed to choose, at a subconscious level, whether to accept the matrix as reality. This choice inevitably results in a One to manifest, which would follow the path Neo took back to the Architect. However in this new matrix, the choice is offered to humankind overtly whether or not to remain plugged in or freed, and this untested approach may not result in a new One to emerge. In the canonical continuation of story in The Matrix Online, this did not happen before humanity and the Machines resumed hostilities again.'

S" Zion is not in the matrix. Zion exists in the real world. So your question doesn't really make sense.Of course, the Oracle was really playing with Morpheus the whole time, at least until it became known that the prophecy was all a lie. Morpheus was given the prophecy of the One so that the new One would be found, as per the Machines wishes. It was a complicated, but predictable and iterable solution to the problem of choice the Machines discovered was inherent in trying to control the human mind on a grand scale. The prophecy was the Oracle's idea, and until Neo, it worked.But Zion was never in the matrix, nor was it presented to be in the films, so the first part of your question is irrelevent to the second."

S' Agent Smith did not die. He, along with Neo, transcended together into their next state of being.Neo and Smith are innately connected with each other. The Oracle describes Smith to Neo as such: "He is you. He is your opposite, your negative. The result of the equation trying to balance itself out." Smith\'s path is deeply woven into Neo\'s. They are inseparable.Neo knew that both he and Smith had reach their respective limitsNeo in the real world and Smith in the Matrix. Neo had penetrated the Machine City and decimated all defenses that the Machines threw at him... blindfolded. He had become undefeatable. Smith had conquered the entire Matrix, replicating himself into every avatar there until it was nothing but a city of Smiths. Neo knew that Smith could not be destroyed, but he could be removed from the Matrix by his own sacrifice. They would transcend both worlds. It was the only way to get Smith out of there.Smith was eradicated from the Matrix as Neo expired in the real world. But neither of them are dead.... it is only left unexplained what their next state of being actually was, because the Wachowskis never took the time to tell us. The films give us very strong clues, however, that neither of them are permanently dead.See: Craig Weiland\'s answer to What happens to Neo at the end of The Matrix Revolutions?'

It was just the prudent thing to do.However many of my friends grew up in more rural places in the state, and they still do not lock their cars... usually they're either at home, where they feel safe, or at work, where their cars are pretty safe in the office parking lot.Now I live in a much smaller city, but I still keep my old habit of keeing it locked wherever I am. My house's front door is always locked, even when I am home. My car doors are locked no matter if I'm at home or elsewhere. In my neighborhood, it's not uncommon that crooks cruise parking lots at night and help themselves to whatever they might find stashed in unlocked parked cars. They got me once when I (quite accidentally) left my car unlocked overnight. Fortunately they didn't take anything of real value, since I don't keep anything of real value in the car that they may have wanted. But it was a worthwhile reminder to always keep my car locked up.Today I keep my car secured in a garage when I'm at home, and I still lock it up when it's in there. No sense falling out of habit."

S" The best Apple keyboard ever made was the Apple Adjustable Keyboard.I've been using Apple keyboards since the late 80s, and this product, which debuted in 1993, is simply the finest keyboard Apple has ever come out with in my opinion.The keys are based on the same Alps mechanical keyswitches as used in the Extended Keyboard II, having perfect feel, travel and feedback. The Adjustable Keyboard was a radical design which featured a hinge in the middle, which could split the board apart down the center for ergonomic comfort. It also included generously sized palm rests on both the alphabet keyboard and the numeric keypad. Yes, it took more desktop space than others, but for those of us whose keyboards are particularly important to our comfort when using a computer for long periods, this was a negligible tradeoff.The keyboard was powered by ADB, Apple's proprietary desktop bus for peripherals.

S' (Sorry, Archie, but there was an all-in-one Mac going back further than that.....!)The Macintosh PortableIt\'s 1990. I\'m a freshman in college, and I\'m working in a computer lab full of Mac SEs sharing a single LaserWriter II printer. I have to work in the Mac lab because I couldn\'t afford my owncollege kids with their own computers were still fairly uncommonand laser printers were very expensive, so to get a decent quality print of a document, you had to bring your files to the lab and print them there.So I\'m sitting at one of the SEs and doing whatever, and I see a guy come in with a jet black case with an Apple logo on it. Out from this case, right in front of me, the guy pulls out this sleek wedge of a computer like nothing I\'d ever seen before. The screen opens on a hinge and it powers up with the startup chime from the Mac II line. I knew two things immediately: I was looking at a very rare and powerful computer, and I had to have one.Be still, my beating heart.About a year later, I was granted my wish. My parents ponied up several thousand dollars for me to buy my own computer, and I\'d sold them on the advantages of a portable computer as opposed to one that was too much trouble to move from my dorm room.It was my most prized possession. I could do all the writing I wanted from anywhere I wanted. I could very easily pack up the machine and take it to work, take it home, take it with me when I visited my parents, take it with me on vacation... I loved that machine. "But it was so heavy!" everyone says.Compared to the Powerbook line, yes. It was heavy compared to them. But it also had a magnificent backlit active matrix displaythe best money could buy at the timeand a lot of other things that, to me, made up the difference. And when the Portable was released, there was no Powerbook line. The Portable came years before them. It\'s not a fair comparison.If you\'re comparing it to its actual contemporaries, the Portable was fast, expandable (it actually had an expansion slot!), had a better screen, a better keyboard and a better battery. It was a desktop computer that could travel, not a laptop. Laptops in the late 80s and early 90s were barely capable of supplementing a desktop computer. They compromised display, keyboard, internal storage, I/O and many other features in favor of weight and size. The Portable made no such compromises. It was a full-featured all-in-one desktop computer that folded up into a tidy little wedge with a handle, and it was all I needed for many years.The Portable continues to list on most compilations of Apple\'s most embarrassing missteps, but as an owner of one, I strenuously disagree. It was a beautiful computer with the best technology of its day.'

So it seems natural to me that Apple would liven it up with different typefaces, representing the variability in people's musical preferences. The campaign photographed in the question details makes perfect sense to me.This is the second logo I've seen that incorporates Apple's new San Francisco Compact (the first being that for the Apple Watch). It seems like a touchup of Nudista Bold to me. A lot of others are comparing it to Akkurat and Colfax. It appears Apple has finally moved on from Myriad, but still isn't so beholden to its brand new font that it can't loosen up with its usage when it suits them. I think the variability of the Apple Music logo is a fun and appropriate creative direction for them to take."

S" Some excellent answers here. I have one other suggestion, which I wrote in answer to What do you do when you get tired of living?, which I will quote:Plan something.Plan something extravagant, something you've always wanted to do but never really thought you could. It can be something that may take many years to prepare for, to save up money for, to research and train for... but give yourself a goal, a realistic one, and make it a goal you really want to achieve. That will give you something you may be missing in your life: hope.Make it something that does not depend on the whims or permission of any other person. Something you do for yourself, something that touches on one of your most cherished life passionsyou know you have them.If a friend (or lover) wants to come, by all means share this with them... but it is yours, not theirs to derail and compromise with concessions to their preferences. Don't let anyone else try to force you to settle for less than your goal.When you feel depressed and alone, and feeling like there's no point to it all, remind yourself that you have a plan, you are working your plan and that someday it will be complete. Remind yourself that there is a joy ahead for you in your future, and to keep going, a day at a time, until you reach it. Don't give up on this plan... cling to it as though your life depended on it, because in a very real way, it does. Do not give up on the plan, and do not give up on yourself.Craig Weiland's answer to What do you do when you get tired of living?"

S' It takes a certain kind of person to be a successful graphic designer, especially one who really enjoys doing it and is willing to make a career out of it. It requires a combination of audacity and humility, of confidence in one\'s talent and a willingness to cheerfully surrender it to another\'s taste preferences. And it demands a willingness to create art that many, many people will see, and be unable to claim any credit for it except privately (or, if you\'re lucky, design awards shows).This isn\'t the entertainment business, where everyone who worked on the movieeven the caterers who fed themgets their names on the finished product. When you put something out there for the world to see, you don\'t want the recognition. You want your client (or employer) to get it, and if they do, you\'ve done your job right.I\'ve been a graphic designer for most of my life. Even as a child, I was artistic. (I was fully vaccinated.) When I was ten years old, I saw the movie Tron and was captivated by the visual effects and the idea that someone could be digitized and transported into a whole other world inside the computer. But I also found the ENCOM logo.... compelling, somehow. I drew it on paper, colored it, cut it out and taped it to my dad\'s car doors. I taped it on our garage door, too. (I was a weird kid, I know.) There was just something neat about a car that wasn\'t just an ordinary, everyday car... a vehicle that had a company\'s logo on it was imbued with purpose, or something.(Tron, 1982)It wasn\'t anything my little 10-year-old brain could express or describe, but it fascinated me. I was too young to know what it was, but I\'d become aware of corporate identity for the first time.When I was in college, I started my first graphic design business with a partner (who still operates the business today). Up to then I\'d mostly done things like rsums, restaurant menus, t-shirts, some small business advertising, and so forth. However, one of our first big clients was a local McDonald\'s franchise, and at one point the franchise owners made available to us a thick book that had been put together by Kragie/Newell in Des Moines. It was their McDonald\'s brand bible. It was the coolest thing this aspiring designer had ever seen: how the various McDonald\'s logos and marks were meant to work. How ads should be laid out and balanced. What typefaces to use. How colors could be combined. How the characters (like Ronald and the Hamburglar) were meant to be portrayed. I could see the brilliance and the depth of thought that went into McDonald\'s corporate branding, stuff you just don\'t even think about, but makes all the difference in the world when it\'s consistently done right. Before then, I was producing ads the way I just... thought they would look good. Upon studying this book, I started to pay attention to how different corporations presented themselves. I could start teasing out the invisible "rules" that guided how their logos were presented. I wanted not only to create great looking and effective designs and graphics, but I realized that I really wanted to be the guy who created those rules, too.Today I\'m the art director for a $1.5b agricultural cooperative in the heartland of the US, and I\'m doing everything I ever dreamed of and then some. In 2010, the cooperative rolled out its first major corporate rebranding in 30 years. I got to create the new logo and all its various permutations. I created a standards guide for it, that codifies all those things that keep a brand distinctive and uniform no matter how or where it\'s used. I designed livery for our fleet trucks, and massive graphics for our 52\' van trailers. I designed a new template for our print advertising, which is seen all over the Midwest. I designed our Web site, which gets visitors from all over the world.This is enormously fulfilling to me. When I see my work out there in the world, representing my cooperative and hopefully improving its image and credibility among farmers and the people who support them, I feel uniquely proud. I feel like I\'m making the world just a little bit better, even though none of those farmers know who I am. When I see one of our trucks go past on the road, with my livery on it, I smile to myself. I think, that\'s one of my trucks. If only my 10-year-old self could see me now... actually, he kind of does.The pride I take in what I do does not come cheap or easy. I work very hard, often coming back to the office on evenings and weekends when it\'s quiet, so I can concentrate on a project without any interruption. I have to be available in the office to everyone else, so I\'m here during the day too. I work with many different people in different divisions all over the company, as well as people at our retail locations calling in from all corners of the territory. I have to be able to listen to these people, and understand what they\'re looking for even when they don\'t really know how to express it. (Fortunately, they usually do, but not always.) I have to deliver work that will do what they need it to do, and I don\'t always have the final say in that. Most people who\'ve been working with me a while trust my advice, but sometimes they just want what they want, whether or not I think it will be effective for them. I have to be able to either communicate that it will not work, or if I can\'t, try to deliver as good of a product as I can that meets their expectations.At times, the job can be downright nerve-racking, and not everyone understands the amount of time that some projects take to produce. When raw copy and information is delivered to me late, incomplete or incorrect (or all of the above), it impinges on my sleep, my leisure time and my sanity. But the upshot of this is, when I deliver the finished product in spite of these unfortunate setbacks, on time and done right, I get to look like a rock star to my bosses, who do appreciate my efforts. So while sometimes the job is more than a little demanding of one\'s time, the emotional payoff can be high when you\'re looking at a finished, great looking printed product in your hands that you\'d personally made possible because you busted your ass for the past three weeks straight.I enjoy the creative outlet and the constant challenges. I enjoy getting to work with powerful computers (and big screens) in a comfortable, white-collar office environment. I enjoy working with other communications professionals I respect and who respect me. I enjoy having flexibility in my hours, such that if I\'m at the office till 2am some night, I can email in and tell my co-workers, "I\'ll be in around 10 tomorrow." I enjoy that I\'m considered a professional, and I make a decent salarynot getting rich here, but it\'s not a bad living.And I take comfort in the fact that my talent and skills will never be obsolete. The economy rises and falls, the fortunes of companies expand and contract. But communications is vital. Every business needs to communicate, and everyone needs their visual communication to look the best it can. No job is 100% rock-solid safe, I know that. But I went into a strong field where there will always be demand for talented, experienced people who aren\'t afraid to work hard. It\'s a good job, and there\'s really nothing else I\'d rather be doing.There\'s one other thing about this job that I feel extremely fortunate for. In 2014, this cooperative celebrated its 100th year. I was tasked with creating a graphic identity for the centennial event, at the center of which was a logo. For that year, this logo was on absolutely everything we did. As part of the Centennial, a lot of historical research was done. I got to see a great deal of photography, artwork and artifacts spanning the last century, all with the company\'s branding. I feel particularly lucky to be here, doing this job, at this particular point in time. Because the work I did for the Centennial is now a part of this proud organization\'s history, and it will continue to be, for as long as it lasts. That\'s a kind of indelible mark I was given the opportunity to make, the likes of which many creative professionals work their entire careers and never get to do.It\'s a good job.'

Smoking is just something she does. The questioner seems to believe that programs can\'t "get high", but I have two issues with this assertion: first, nowhere in the Matrix films is this established (programs are shown to enjoy sex and a great many other human pleasures, physical and emotional), and two, smoking tobacco doesn\'t produce a "high". Smokers smoke because they like the calming effect it has, and the flavor of it. The Oracle smokes because she feels like it. I very much doubt she worries about a cancer risk, just like I doubt the Merovingian worries about contracting an STD when he seduces random women who dine in his restaurant. They\'re both programs in a simulated reality, not living human beings. Even if there is a risk she might get cancer from smoking, the Oracle already knows she\'s not going to be around long enough to find out.'

S' No one is "ad immune". While web advertising offers an immediate call to action (click here!), this is only one of its purposes, a secondary purpose at best. Its primary purpose is to be seen and communicate its advertising message.As savvy Web users, our eyes are trained to ignore anything that looks like an advertisement on our Web pages. (Sometimes it\'s quite startling how blind people can be to user interface elements when they come too close to resembling ads.) But that doesn\'t mean we aren\'t exposed, or invulnerable to their influence.

An ad for an expensive, trendy new Bluetooth speaker may find its way onto our Amazon wish-list at a future date.All it needs to do is find just the slightest amount of our attention, and its mission is accomplished.

S' As others have pointed out, Blackberry was the first* smartphone. It was the first phone that could access email and provide limited Web functionality, which made it indispensable to businesspeople prior to the advent of the iPhone, which completely changed the way people understood and used smartphones. Today Blackberry is less known in the smartphone space because Apple and Android have carved out vast swaths of its previous marketshare. But as a platform it is still quite strong, particularly in other parts of the world, but also among those of usI use a BB Q10 as my "daily driver"who are interested in security, reliability and communications functionality as its core mission.Here\'s what I tell people who ask me why I went with Blackberry: my phone is not a lifestyle. I want my phone to be a phone. I do not need a little mobile Web browsing device that can also function as a phone. I do not need a little mobile gaming device that also happens to work as a phone. I don\'t need it to play music or watch TV shows. I don\'t need to look up song lyrics or post on Facebook. I have computers for that, and an iPad. What I want is a reliable mobile communications hub, for voice as well as text. Blackberry handles text messaging, as well as its outstanding Blackberry Messenger system, very well. Its ability to manage multiple email accounts is smooth and effortless. I also love having a physical keyboard, and Blackberry makes the best in the business (but also offers products with innovative virtual keyboards too).As Blackberry is designed to appeal to professionals and not 13 year old girls, its OS is functional, clean and no-nonsense. Exactly what I want.I\'m aware that no smartphone is 100% safe from government snooping, but I appreciate that Blackberry is a Canadian company and that makes it one step further removed from US backdoor shenanigans. Blackberry is also very much about the security of the information moving through its channels and this has been of primary concern to them from the beginning. I would trust my Blackberry a lot sooner than I\'d trust an iPhone or Android device.*Not the first technically, but the first device to combine PDA, email connectivity and telephony using secure encryption, making it the device of choice for enterprise in the early 2000s. I\'d venture to say that very few people knew what a "smartphone" was before Blackberry made them commonplace in business.'

S' Their parents\' perspective.Often when a teenager will want something or want to do something and the parent will deny it to them, the teen will get angry. "Why can\'t I [have it]?" they ask. The parents\' response often comes in the form of, "Because I said so."This is infuriating to the teen. The teen knows only their own personal experience and the short-term need that the thing they want will address. They are incapable of seeing a bigger picture, one that includes not only this short-term thing but the possible long-term ramifications of it or various possible unintended consequences that stem from it. This perspective is completely foreign to them so they don\'t understand that it even exists.And most parents aren\'t even aware that this is the basis for their parenting decisions in many cases. They know that X behavior could lead to possible Y bad consequences and they don\'t want that for their children, so X behavior is just off limits. But the reason they know that is because they have a few more decades of life experience of their own, and they have a more seasoned view of how the world works than their children do because they have a more mature way of looking at the world. They have a broad life perspective. Teenagers have a very, very narrow one.But you can\'t communicate this to most teenagers. Their needs are immediate and they cannot see past them into a possible context that isn\'t in their long-term interests. They are like the proverbial mouse in the maze. From their point of view, life is a series of simple choices: what turn to make next. Parents are seeing much more of the maze their children are navigating and can more effectively guide them toward positive outcomes, even if it seems contradictory to their children\'s short-term priorities of the moment.'

I\'m sure there are plenty of great guys out there named Eugene who are anything but the character in the film shown here, but that\'s what I think of when presented with the name.The second connotation is more serious. "Eugenia" is strongly homophonous with eugenics, which was an excerable (yet at the time, highly fashionable) intellectual assumption that the human race would be better served by breeding out undesirable races.

For a screen that size, an interface designer is going to be less concerned with the finer details of ligature, kerning, tracking, leading and type design then s/he will with functionality and readability. Typeface selection will have to be deliberate, of course, but simple letterforms will work better in such a small display than elaborate flourishes or exaggerated serifs. I\'m willing to bet most apps will rely on sans-serif fonts, to display information as concisely as possible while maintaining legibility.That\'s not to say that simple faces designed for small screens are unsophisticated. Anything but. Many popular faces have entire variants expressly for use on small digital screens like phones, PDAs and single-function devices like MP3 players.

John Irvine writes of this method in the article Luigi Nonos Canti di vita e damore: New Phases of Development 1960-62:[...] One can also sense Nono looking back on his Venetian heritage by, firstly, taking on the spatiomusical innovations of the Gabrielis (the placement of sounds in a particular space or acoustic) and secondly, that inspired by the highly chromatic music of Gesualdo (microtonal movement within the sounds themselves). It seems as if everything Nono does in his creative life takes Venice, and particularly the Giudecca, his home, as the chief poetic point of departure [...]Instruments are laid out on the score in groups of twelve which obviously facilitates Nono\'s desire to position all twelve tones, and their twelve intervening microtones, in some form of stratification across the instrumental sections. This concept of grouping his orchestra into \'choirs\' of woodwind, brass, strings and percussion implies that each section will have its own unique functionality; and will accordingly give rise to music in which opposing groups are able to work antiphonally, as separate entities, with or against each other.\t\t\t\t This "stratification" described in the Irvine excerpt relates to a technique of orchestration coined by theorist Edward T. Cone with regards to the music of Igor Stravinsky. Stratification means a sudden change in the music that makes the piece of music change dramatically, often incorporating a division of layers as the music progresses. This is heard most decisively in the first movement Sul Ponte di Hiroshima with Nono drawing on the instrumental choirs within the full orchestra to signal shifts, often linked to changes in tempo.Canti di vita e d\'amore also signals an important major departure from the typical serial techniques for Nono. In the article Luigi Nono\'s Canti di vita e d\'amore: Musical Dialectics and the Opposition of the Present and Future author Bruce Durazzi cites a verbal note from Nono stating that this work would no longer use complete serial series, but instead would be composed of campi sonori (sounding fields) or fascie sonori (sounding bands) built upon collections of a few basic intervals. Durazzi goes on to explain how Nono utilizes this new way of thinking in Canti di vita e d\'amore:\t\t\t\t\tThe pitch material is organized in various ways to construct campi sonori, normally in the form of tone clusters that exhaust a given collection of pitches according to some pattern: quarter- tone clusters of up to twenty-four notes, semitone clusters of up to twelve notes, whole-tone clusters of up to six notes, and occasionally complementary groupings of three-note cells of pitch-class set type [0,1,4].What is fascinating about the campi sonori is how throughout the first and third movements these clusters are arrived at, specifically, which points Nono decides to increase the divisi and which points to return to many instruments on a part. For I. Sul ponte di Hiroshima these increases and decreases in divisi effect the microtonal saturation at any given moment. Nono orchestrates using \'pitch bands\', whereby each instrument has a specific confined range, far more exacting and limiting than the typical \'natural\' ranges of these instruments. These bandwidths are heard structurally and gesturally as waves entering and leaving the texture. Irvine describes an example of this treatment of microtonal pitches in the opening of Canti di cita e d\'amore:The woodwind section never uses microtones, whilst the string have all 24 pitches at their disposal from the very beginning of the first movement. The brass begins to use microtones at bar 31 in the French horns and then more consistently from bar 70 to the end of the movement. There are three occurrences of microtones in the percussion when the timbani play in short 6, 7, and 9 bar bursts of clusters.[...]The non-motific and textual technique he employs here in the instrumental writing utilizes all twenty- four pitches and there is a consistent approach of the surrounding suspended notes with microtonal clusters. At this stage of his creative life a total, stratified chromaticism was common in Nono\'s work and out interest in pitch lies in the registral placement of these notes in their specific wave-form and in their relationships with other musical parameters. This approach to the orchestra with the campi sonori may be seen as dialoguing with the historical "sound-cloud"/"micropolyphonic"/"tone cluster" works immediately before it. While it does share the same densely saturated walls of sound covering the quarter-tone steps within larger intervals, there are clear distinctions. Iannis Xenakis\' Metastaseis (1954), Gyorgy Ligeti\'s Apparitions (1958-1959), and Krzysztof Penderecki\'s Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1960) use the clusters as the entire texture. Nono\'s writing in Canti di vita e d\'amore is often arguably more subtle, and perhaps even more complex. The clusters are compartmentalized in these \'waves\', usually isolated to given instrumental choirs. Thus, while these clusters are entering and exiting the textures, other elements are sometimes also active and following different compositional techniques. Though Xenakis, Ligeti, and Penderecki show more total line independence in their respective works due to the greater number of players partaking in any given cluster, all of their massive divisi function as a unified composite, with all of the forces contributing to create the same sound. In Canti di vita e d\'amore despite not having the same total number of divisi, there is a sense of multiple textures happening at once. II. Djamila Boupacha is orchestrationally very straight forward as it only involves solo soprano. Durazzi suspects that this movement was written earlier than the surrounding movements, and that is why the approach is completely different. Perhaps this was a "free-standing solo vocal work or as part of a project that was to be separate from the \'Hiroshima cantata\'."III. Tu returns to the full forces of the first movement. Durazzi explains the evolution of campi sonori in this last movement:The campi sonori are developed using essentially the same techniques as in the first movement, but the roles of the orchestral instruments are substantially different. Except for a few notes in measures 182-84, the strings never play in the traditional modes of arco or pizzicato, but instead produce percussive effects (strings tapped by the fingers or col legno battuto in various positions along the fingerboard). Another distinction between the first and third movements is the treatment of divisi. In Sul ponte di Hiroshima the string section transitions between various degrees of saturation with divisi, and cannot be reduced to a simple linear gesture (such as one large unison to divisi trajectory). Whereas, Tu does maintain a linear trajectory in the string divisi, moving from unison at the beginning to fully divisi at the finale. Nono also ups the ante within the full divisi texture, which now consists of triple-stops in all the strings. Lastly, there is the role of the percussion clusters. Durazzi makes a case for their inclusion by relating their role to the "fratello" motive from Luigi Dallapiccola\'s opera Il prigioniero (194448). Here the tuned metal sheets are tied to the notion of hope that conditions might improve. This motif is borrowed by Nono in a number of works as late as Con Luigi Dallapiccola (1979) for six percussionists and live electronics. Durazzi follows this motivic relationship chronologically back through to the beginning of the final movement of Canti di vita e d\'amore, stating: [After] the strong promise of a brighter future, the first sound in the orchestra is a twelve-note cluster played by bells. The predominance of bells and cymbals emphasizes the new-found sense of hope in the final movement and thus emphasizes the global progression of themes in the work. The way the orchestration is treated in the various movements may be understood (when taken with the lyrical content) to complete a narrative moving from mass destruction in the past to the tortured individual in the present and lastly the hope for the future.'

Composer Jonathan Harvey took the bells harmonic spectrum and examined it with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) program at IRCAM. The influence of the specific technology used, especially during these early days of computer music analysis, should not be overlooked. In this case Harvey, with the technical assistance of Stanley Haynes, realized the synthetic bell modulations and transformations on IRCAMs version of MusicV (originally created by Max Mathews in 1969).The second sound source, that of the choristers Latin singing, was then also synthesized from a live recording; however, this time using the program CHANT developed by Gerald Bennett and Xavier Rodet. The boy soprano heard on the recording was Harveys son Dominic who, according to author Mario Sibilia in his article Analysis and Listening Score of Mortuos plango, Vivos voco, was a chorister at Winchester Cathedral from 1975 to 1980 (the year Harvey received this commission by the Centre George Pompidou in Paris). The intangible connection a father has with the sound of his son is so personal that it had to have influenced him regarding how the vocal line was then treated. Furthermore, there is a strangely ironic aspect to what Harvey must have experienced; listening to words lamenting the dead coming from his still very much alive son, only to then gradually pull at the musical nature of the sons song through electronic manipulations until it has lost its human characteristics, effectively becoming dead.Scholars often go into great detail unpacking the electronic means undertaken by Harvey to create Mortuos plango, and rightly so given its place as a pioneering work of computer music. However, what is underplayed is the influence of the Anglican choral tradition. Though his later works reference a certain non-specific spirituality, Harvey spent many of his most formative years studying music at St. Johns College, University of Cambridge. The choir at St. Johns is among the most famous in England and has sung daily services in the College Chapel since the 1670s. Even if Harvey did not frequently attend chapel, it would be extremely unlikely that he would have been able to avoid its influence. In addition to Evensong six days a week, they also perform at a number of other well-known events throughout the academic year and have been recording extensively on the Decca/Argo label since the 1950s.Returning to procedure, though one can point to the specific software Harvey used to carry out the spectral analyses; this practice of composing based on source material overtones also implies the influence of Gerard Grisey and Tristan Murail. Both Grisey and Murail were in residence at IRCAM throughout the 1970s and developed spectral techniques with the Ensemble lItineraire. As the term spectralism was only coined by Hughes Dufourt one year prior to Mortuos plango and first published in an article one year after the completion of Mortuos plango, it is perhaps best to think of Harveys efforts as proto-spectral or belonging to the late 1970s  early 1980s spectral zeitgeist at IRCAM. In a similar vein, Harveys composition shows a certain dialogue with the acousmatic listening and musique concrete works of Pierre Schaeffer. With Schaeffer the goal was often abstraction of sounds recorded from the natural worlds, divorcing the received meaning from its original source. Harvey clearly presents both his sound sources in their raw, highly recognizable form, but over the course of the piece gradually abstracts them by moving along a real vs. synthesized continuum.Lastly, there is the lineage of tape music leading up to Mortuos plango. After earning a PhD at Cambridge Harvey studied with Milton Babbitt at Princeton University on a Harkness Fellowship. While there, in addition to the works of Babbitt, Otto Luening, and Vladimir Ussachevsky using the Columbia-Princeton Studios, he would have been aware of the electro-acoustic compositions of Karlheinz Stockhausen. According to biographer Arnold Whittall:During the mid1960s [Harvey] became increasingly aware of new attitudes to time and space in the music of Stockhausen (on whom he published a monograph in 1975), and a period of study at Princeton with Babbitt strengthened his concern with posttonal compositional systems as well as with the possibilities of electroacoustic techniques. [] But for Harvey, like Stockhausen, the best way to explore the special character of the single note was by means of electroacoustics, and as an early recruit to IRCAM he found Boulezs Paris Institute a stimulating environment for the development of his technical and aesthetic predispositions.One could imagine that Stockhausens Gesang der Jnglinge ("Song of the Youths"), often called the first masterpiece of electronic music, was of particular influence while writing Mortuos plango. Realized in 195556 at the Westdeutscher Rundfunk studio in Cologne, Gesang der Jnglinge notably features vocals supplied by 12-year-old Josef Protschka. The inclusion and innocence implied by the purity of a young boys voice creates a precedent with Gesang der Jnglinge that Mortuos plango follows, immediately drawing a comparison between the works.'

S' It is difficult to state anything about Johannes Ockeghems life with certainty due to the lack of existing original accounts from that time. For instance, his date of birth, though postulated between 1410-1425, is still open to debate by early music scholars. It should then come as no surprise that little is known surrounding Ockeghems life while composing Missa Prolationum, even basic information like the date of the work. The era from the mid to late 15th century is commonly used as a compositional date, but nothing more specific has been confirmed. Nevertheless, one can surely speculate about possible influences given knowledge of the time, place, and musical culture.Ockeghem is grouped with the Franco-Flemish School of composers. These include the first generation (1420-1450) figures like Guillaume Dufay, Gilles Binchois, and Antoine Busnois; and the second generation" (1450-1485) contemporaries of Ockeghem including Orto, Compere, Prioris, Agricola, Caron, Faugues, Regis, and Tinctorus. Biographer Leeman L. Perkins states that while Ockeghem may have begun his musical life as a choirboy training in Saint Ghislain, it is more probable he received most of his early education in the nearby Mons. Regardless, as a youth training as a chorister Ockeghem would have likely been familiar with the first generation of Franco-Flemish Composers, performing their works frequently.As Ockeghem matured in his musical abilities he was appointed to the court of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon, whose principal residence was in Moulins. According to Perkins, Ockeghem was listed first among the seven signer of the ducal chapel, preceded only by the premier chaplain and three priests, indicating that his performance skills were highly valued. When he then transitioned into composing masses his experiences performing such works from a young age must have informed his aesthetics and technique. Kenneth Kreitner points out the potential influence of these first generation composers in the paper Very Low ranges in the sacred music of Ockeghem and Tinctoris:Here for the last time in [Missa Prolationum] Ockeghem gives us the contrast, so characteristic of the first three movements, of slow harmonic rhythm and dense texture framing faster, more lightly scored harmonic and rhythmic activity. Such textural and rhythmic contrast seems almost archaistically reminiscent of the isorhythmic motets of Dunstable and Dufay.  Regarding the influence of his peers of this second generation, it is clear that there was an active practice of contemporary composers setting melodic passages of others within their works. Sometimes this was observed by taking a cantus firmus from one piece by one composer and re-contextualizing it in another piece by another composer. Perkins shows this was common for Ockeghem, and though it reveals a lot about the state of authorship during the era, it makes attribution in an absolute sense even more difficult. For instance, Perkins notes that the attribution to Ockeghem of Ut heremita solus is implied in Crtins Dploration; the work may have been Ockeghems reply to Busnoys In hydraulis. For Missa Prolationum Perkins goes so far as to assert that Ockeghem artfully concealed the execution of certain compositional materials in accordance with the principal aesthetic ideals of the period, as articulated, for example, by Tinctoris. Consequently, the unfamiliar features of Ockeghems style continue to pose problems for present analysis.Nevertheless, there has been a great deal of analysis regarding the form and structure in Ockeghems works. Reflecting this, Missa Prolationum is categorized as a prolation canon or mensuration canon, because its main melody is accompanied by one or more imitation of that melody in other voices. Mensuration canons are often thought of to be among the most difficult to write because not only do the voices sing the same melody, but also they do so at different speeds. As a result of this complexity of construction they are fairly uncommon throughout the repertoire. Author Edward A. Melson in his paper Compositional Strategies in Mensuration and Proportion Canons, ca. 1400 to ca. 1600 points out that Ockeghems interest in this specific method was a rarity for the time:The record for this canon is not so extensive as for the motet, probably not least because in contrast to motets, mensuration and proportion canons form a miniscule part of the total repertoire of Renaissance music, and no composer apart from Ockeghem seems to have shown a sustained interest in them. In order to find a historical precursor to Missa Prolationum with a high probability that Ockeghem would have studied as an example of a rigorous mensuration canon, one may have to widen the search beyond the Franco-Flemish School. Johannes Ciconia (c.1370-1412) is a good candidate, as his Le Ray Au Soleyl was quite influential. Also, at a nearly a century earlier still, there was Philippe de Vitry (1291-1361) whose four prolations were used simultaneously by Ockeghem in Missa Prolationum. Perkins describes this act of musical quotation by Ockeghem as: [Perhaps] the most extraordinary contrapuntal achievement of the 15th century [] it presents a series of canons whose interval of imitation expands from the unison progressively through to the octave in accordance with a complex combination of verbal instructions, rests and mensural signs. Surprisingly, the result is a graceful, euphonious composition that gives the listener no hint of the intricate technical problems it embodies. Lastly, a major influence inherent in the complex canons was mathematics, and though this is not technically a musical influence it did shape compositional thought the 15th century. Paul Kinsman in Platonic and Pythagorean Ratios in the Formal Analysis of 15th Century Music highlights this crucial aspect of Ockeghems Missa Prolationum: This mass typifies a musical composition whose structure suggests a link with the type of celestial mathematics that pervades 15th C composition. The Prolation mass consists entirely of mensuration canons, or prolations, which employ a single melody to be imitated by one or more voices after a duration of time. In Ockeghems original mass only two voices are notated and the other two voices must be derived from the notated. When the two notated voices perform with the other two derived voices, a double prolation canon ensues. Ockeghem places the upper pair of original and derived voices in the prolatio major while the lower voices in prolatio minor and one voice in each of the pair sings in perfect time while the other sings in imperfect time. In Missa Prolationum the interval of imitation increases throughout the mass from the unison up to the octave, using all of the traditionally imperfect intervals as well. This intricate mass is one of Ockeghems most intricate pieces and in turn one of the most complex Renaissance compositions. Beside the intricate prolation canon, the actual structure of the mass references divine mathematics.'

S' [Image via The Sound of Struggle Tempered With Terror: Penderecki At 80]Krzysztof Pendereckis Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima (1960) was written for 52 string instruments and is notable for the use of extended instrumental techniques (playing behind the bridge, bowing on the tailpiece, etc.) and textures consisting of tone clusters. The extended techniques employed throughout Threnody were not novel on an individual basis. However, their application to an entire string orchestra, and paired with unconventional notation made the results unique for the time. The tone clusters could be seen as dialoging with the works immediately predating Threnody such as the sound-clouds of Iannis Xenakis (ex. Metastaseis, 1954) or micropolyphony of Gyorgy Ligeti (ex. Apparitions, 1958-1959), though it is unclear exactly how much their concepts influenced Pendereckis writing. The opening of Metastaseis is a particularly striking similarity to passages of Threnody, with Xenakis texture dominated by the string section split up into 46 separate parts, all completing glissandi at different pitch levels from a union to create a sound mass. What is more fascinating still is that Xenakis preliminary sketch for Metastaseis was in graphic notation, again baring certain similarities to Pendereckis aleatoric notation with Threnody, showing graphs of mass motion and glissandi like structural beams of the piece, with pitch on one axis and time on the other. Yet unlike Penderecki who took his aleatoric representation as the completed score, Xenakis then rewrote every event in traditional notation for the published score.Perhaps more importantly, what separates each of these composers techniques is the means of achieving the dense, individually moving divisi lines. Xenakis achieves his sound-cloud textures through mathematical structures and probabilities, taking data derived from such equations to determine starting and ending pitches/attack times/durations, then transcribing them to music paper. Ligeti was heavily influenced by the massive polyphonic canons in the music of early choral composers like Johannes Ockeghem, and thus, applied such ideas to a dodecaphonic pitch language. Penderecki produced his extensive elaborations on tone clusters by aleatoric means, often involving a multitude of glissandi effects with indeterminate repetitions of attacks and entrances. It is possible that the similarities between all of these works stem from a late 1950s  early 1960s, increase in textual complexity zeitgeist, rather than peer influence. The use of aleatory is coupled with a time-line notation or proportional notation where rather than meters and bar lines the composer writes durations (in minutes and seconds) for how long a given gesture should last. There is a certain lack of temporal precision inherent in how this time-line notation is used by Penderecki. Add the often similarly indeterminate element of pitch (with indications like as high as possible) and it is clear that the complexity heard in performance far exceeds the complexity shown of the page. Penderecki deconstructs what is required to create sound masses. The differentiation between these compositional methodologies is therefore beyond labels and the aesthetics of notation, it is a matter of decision making. For Xenakis sound-clouds and Ligetis micropolyphony the composer carefully instructs each performer on the changing musical parameters at any given time. For Pendereckis sound masses the composer provides a loose shape and the performers make their own decisions (to an extent) to achieve the shape.This transfer of creative decision-making from the composer to performer shows the influence of John Cage. In Tony Bannachs paper An Extended Analysis of Krzysztof Pendereckis Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima the author notes that [with] music like 12 tone or serial music, no new changes were necessary to the establishment of the score, but when we see the rise of the Cageian indeterminate aesthetics, this became an interesting dilemma. Indeed, Penderecki took a strong interest in Cages different ways of approaching the passage of time within music. Beyond notation, the influence of Cage on Threnody is apparent in its original title 837, likely a reference to Cages 433. Regarding this title change, Sarah Wallin quotes Penderecki in the Anthology saying:[The piece] existed only in my imagination, in a somewhat abstract way. When Jan Krenz recorded it and I could listen to an actual performance, I was struck with the emotional charge of the work. I thought it would be a waste to condemn it to such anonymity, to those digits. I searched for associations and, in the end; I decided to dedicate it to the Hiroshima victims. (p.393) Though this rationale for this change sounds honest enough, according to Bannachs research the title change was made for far more selfish reasons:[Penderecki] only ended changing the name after a recommendation from a friend, who advised him that it would make a more emotional impact for his entering in the UNESCO Prize of the International Composers Jury. That change had an obvious and intended impact. The use of Hiroshima evokes so many emotions, but mostly of sheer horror, a kind of terror hitherto unknown by mankind, that of a nuclear annihilation.  Regardless of which of the reasons is true, the influence and council of the friend, Polish conductor Jan Krenz, is present in both accounts. In the year before writing Threnody, Penderecki won a series of composition prizes. Biographer Adrian Thomas attributes the success of these earlier works with the composers rapid advancement, distilling Stravinskian and Webernian choralism [] to Boulezian gestures. Thomas continues by saying that "though Penderecki never fully engaged with orthodox serial techniques," he did "absorb certain permutational procedures and explore textural writing" which leads to the full blown sonorisms of subsequent scores. Emanations (1958), with its two string orchestras tuned a semitone apart, paved the way for Threnody, which uses quartertone clusters. Within the canonic sections of Threnody Wallin notes the symmetrical organization of materials to be Webernian in principle as well.The influence of Stravinskian and Webernian choralism is further contextualized in Bannachs analysis, whereby he describes the division of the string orchestra up into different choirs in Threnody: Each choirs differential in range is about a third to a tritone from top voice of the choir to the bottom voice. Now, keep in mind, that while each choir is a collection of microtonal pitches, these choirs all overlap with each other to form a composite microtonal collection that spans from an Ab in the contrabasses to a high B natural in the first choir of violins. So all in all that is 52 instruments playing individual microtonal notes spanning a range of around 4 octaves. This, without a doubt, creates an incredible amount of force and tension when played. This tension caused by microtonal clusters is found the piece, and is enhanced with Pendereckis implementation of various timbral and Klangfarbenmelodie type effects.  The concept of klangfarbenmelodie or tone color melody is often credited to the Second Viennese School, in particular Arnold Schoenberg. Bannach asserts that timbre then truly became an independent component in the 1950s when Serialism became a prominent movement in classical music, from the likes of Stockhausen, Babbit, Boulez, and others. This focus on various timbres and the way they evolve in an acoustical space over time is the primary concern throughout Threnody. In the book To Cut the Gordian Knot: The Timbre System of Krzysztof Penderecki, author Danuta Mirka theorizes that Pendereckis interest in such topics may have been through the acoustician Mieczyslaw Drobner:It is likely that such a splendidly simplified image of the sound producing process was taken up by Penderecki from the teaching of Mieczyslaw Drobner, the eminent Polish acoustician and organologist. In 1958 Drobner moved from Lodi to Krakow to take the post of lecturer at Paristwowa Wyzsza Szkola Muzyczna, the school where Penderecki had recently finished his study in composition and was employed as an assistant. (p.436) Lastly, there is the possible influence of Edgard Varse. Wallin notes that: "Varses conception of music as spatialopened the door to music that centered not on melody, harmony, or counterpoint but on sound itselfComposers now wrote pieces whose material consists primarily of striking sound combinations that create interesting and novel textures, organized by gradual or sudden processes of change. Threnody is the embodiment of music which consists of striking sound combinations to create interesting and novel textures.'

S' [Image via Work of the week - Luigi Nono: Canti di vita e d\'amore]Written for soprano and tenor soloists with orchestra, the easiest entry into a discussion of Luigi Nonos influences while composing Canti di vita e damore ("Songs of Life and Love") is perhaps through his treatment of the works instrumentation. From 1941 to 1945 he studied composition with Gian Francesco Malipiero at the Venice Conservatory where, according to biographer Gianmario Borio, there was an emphasis on vocal polyphony and the madrigal tradition. This interest in early vocal writing manifests itself in Canti di vita e damore through spatialization and the division of the orchestra into discrete choirs. Regarding the renaissance connection, John Irvine writes in the article Luigi Nonos Canti di vita e damore: New Phases of Development 1960-62: [] One can also sense Nono looking back on his Venetian heritage by, firstly, taking on the spatiomusical innovations of the Gabrielis (the placement of sounds in a particular space or acoustic) and secondly, that inspired by the highly chromatic music of Gesualdo (microtonal movement within the sounds themselves). It seems as if everything Nono does in his creative life takes Venice, and particularly the Giudecca, his home, as the chief poetic point of departure []Instruments are laid out on the score in groups of twelve which obviously facilitates Nono\'s desire to position all twelve tones, and their twelve intervening microtones, in some form of stratification across the instrumental sections. This concept of grouping his orchestra into \'choirs\' of woodwind, brass, strings and percussion implies that each section will have its own unique functionality; and will accordingly give rise to music in which opposing groups are able to work antiphonally, as separate entities, with or against each other.Borio notes that in conjunction with the contrapuntal techniques of the Franco-Flemish School, which Nono had studied throughout his life, lies the influence of the dodecaphonic canons of Anton Webern and Luigi Dallapiccola. The music of Anton Webern, along with the other Second Viennese School composers (primarily Arnold Schoenberg), Igor Stravinsky, Bela Bartok, and Olivier Messiaen has been of particular interest to Nono since at least his years at the Venice Conservatory. Belonging to the previous generation of Italian composers, Luigi Dallapiccola and his music influenced Nono from the mid-1940s onward. Beyond dodecaphonic canons, Nono utilizes some of Dallapiccola\'s musical symbolism. For instance, author Bruce Durazzi in the article Musical Dialectics and the Opposition of Present and Future points out that the fratello motive from Dallapiccolas opera Il prigioniero (194448) signifies hope that conditions might improve. Nono has assigned Dallapiccolas motive of hope to tuned metal sheets in a number of works as late as Con Luigi Dallapiccola (1979) for six percussionists and live electronics. Durazzi follows this motivic relationship chronologically back through to the beginning of the final movement of Canti di vita e d\'amore, stating: [After] the strong promise of a brighter future, the first sound in the orchestra is a twelve-note cluster played by bells. The predominance of bells and cymbals emphasizes the new-found sense of hope in the final movement and thus emphasizes the global progression of themes in the work.In Canti di vita e damore the Second Viennese School influence is seen most prominently via the rigorous organization of materials, especially pitches (as described in the discrete choirs quotation). Schoenberg, whose daughter Nono in fact married, also influenced Nonos decision to compose with activist themes at the core of his musical message. For instance, according to Durazzi, Nono\'s first publicly performed work was the Variazioni canoniche sulla serie dellop. 41 di Arnold Schnberg (1949), which refers to Schoenbergs Ode to Napoleon (widely understood as an anti-fascist work). Canti di vita e d\'amore takes this social activism message and focuses on the threat posed by nuclear weapons.The relationship with the music of Stravinsky is notable through the shared use of what theorist Edward T. Cone calls stratification. Stratification means a sudden change in the music that makes the piece of music change dramatically, often incorporating a division of layers as the music progresses. This is heard most decisively in the first movement Sul Ponte di Hiroshima with Nono drawing on the instrumental choirs within the full orchestra to signal shifts, often linked to changes in tempo. The early influence of Bartok in the first movement is perhaps most evident with the emphasis on geometrically derived proportions. Irvine points out that-- Paradoxically, the greatest point of rest is where one might expect the climax of the work; at approximately the point of the \'Golden Section\' (bars 80-95) in many ways typifying Nono\'s unconventional, even subversive musical mind. The inclusion of palindromes and number sequences to generate rhythms and durations, though seen in passages of Bartok, point to an influence of Messiaen as well, who has written extensively on the use of these compositional techniques.Canti di vita e d\'amore also signals an important major departure from the typical serial techniques for Nono. Durazzi cites a verbal note from Nono stating that this work would no longer use complete serial series, but instead would be composed of campi sonori (sounding fields) or fascie sonori (sounding bands) built upon collections of a few basic intervals. Durazzi goes on to explain how Nono utilizes this new way of thinking in Canti di vita e d\'amore:The pitch material is organized in various ways to construct campi sonori, normally in the form of tone clusters that exhaust a given collection of pitches according to some pattern: quarter- tone clusters of up to twenty-four notes, semitone clusters of up to twelve notes, whole-tone clusters of up to six notes, and occasionally complementary groupings of three-note cells of pitch-class set type [0,1,4]. The resulting textures produced by the campi sonori are, as one might imagine, densely saturated walls of sound covering the quarter-tone steps within a larger interval. The immediate historic comparison would be to the sound-clouds of Iannis Xenakis (ex. Pithoprakta, 1956), micropolyphony of Gyorgy Ligeti (ex. Apparitions, 1958-1959), and the tone clusters of Krzysztof Penderecki (ex. Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima, 1960). Though all of these works are precursors, it is unclear how much their concepts influenced Nono\'s writing in Canti di vita e d\'amore. One primary distinction is the use of independent lines. Though achieved through different means (aleatory vs. notated polyphony), this feature unifies Xenakis, Ligeti, and Penderecki. Nono uses the same large scale divisi and pitch distribution, but often without the independent, individualized movements within each divisi texture. It is possible that the similarities between all of these works stem from a late 1950s  early 1960s, increase in textual complexity zeitgeist, rather than peer influence. Nevertheless, some of the relationships are uncanny. Nono has written about his lifelong study of Italian Renaissance choral composers Gabrieli and Gesualdo with regard to their use of spatialization, as well as figures from the Franco-Flemish School. Ligeti attributes much of the influence for his micropolyphony technique, especially as used in Lux Aeterna and Requiem, to Johannes Ockeghem, arguably the most famous composer of the Franco-Flemish School. Another specific connection between Canti di vita e d\'amore and Ligeti\'s music is the method of pitch choice between each individual instrument. In Irvine\'s analysis he highlights that in the first movement: Six notes are distributed between the violins in a form of cross fertilization; each entry determined by successive notes from the first violin part. This creates a web of sound producing a strikingly referential effect, in that all the parts are here alluding to one another. A technique similar to that used by Gyorgy Ligeti in his Chamber Concerto (1969-70). Next, there is the issue of shared programmatic theme. Penderecki\'s Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima was completed just two years before Nono\'s Canti di vita e d\'amore, whose first movement utilizes text from the book To Be or Not To Be: Diary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by Gunther Anders. In Nono\'s defense, though composed later, Canti di vita e d\'amore shows evidence of the chosen text being integral to the understanding of the work. On the other hand, Penderecki had already completed and premiered Threnody, originally called 8\'37" (at times also 8\'26") as perhaps a nod to John Cage\'s 4\'33", before deciding to dedicate the work to the victims of Hiroshima. It is likely that because Nono and Penderecki\'s compositions are so close in date, Nono had already selected his text and begun the piece before Penderecki changed his work\'s title.Regarding text, though not technically a musical influence, the choice of text has shaped the composition and subsequent understanding of Canti di vita e d\'amore. For instance, the use of excerpts from Anders\' To Be or Not To Be: Diary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was so critical to the identity of the work that not only did Nono use it for the composition\'s subtitle (Sul ponte di Hiroshima // On the Bridge of Hiroshima), but actually wrote into the score the lines beyond what he set for the voices as a \'guide\' to the conductor and players. The second movement, Djamila Boupacha, moves from suffering on a massive scale represented by the full ensemble to suffering on an individual scale. Here Nono sets a poem by Jesus Lopez Pacheco in which the tortured Algerian student of the title begs: "to see things like a child" and to be free from "this night of blood, this endless mud." Nono scores this for solo soprano (unaccompanied), allowing the audience to impose the girl from the text onto the vocalist. The last movement Tu is set to the words of Cesare Pavese and anticipates a new dawn for society. According to Borio, Nono redefined Utopia through his own concepts of other ways of listening and possible infinities. This desire to create a new, more just society is at the core Canti di vita e d\'amore and was likely influenced by Nono\'s political background. Borio notes that the Nazi occupation and the Italian Resistance were fundamental to Nono\'s general development. In 1952 the composer became a member of the Italian Communist Party, and as Durazzi mentions, Canti represents Nono\'s move away from a kind of leftist idealism and toward more concrete forms of social and political activism. Lastly, there is the influence of Nono\'s close friends Bruno Maderna and Emilio Vedova. Borio writes that meeting Maderna in 1946 was musically critical for Nono, as they formed a small community in Venice who, through the examination of the contrapuntal, harmonic and formal foundations of European art music, aimed to develop a new musical language. Maderna\'s criticisms of integral serialism may have led to Nono\'s new approach to pitch (campi sonori) in Canti di vita e d\'amore. Maderna saw composers relying on serial techniques to establish a divide between their music and pre-WWII classical traditions. He went on to say in an interview with Leonardo Pinzuati:There never has been any zero year in music, just as there can never be any zero year of culture. It would be as though someone reaching the age of thirty were to say \'my life is now beginning\'! That sounds all very well, but the preceding years still happened, he still lived them, with all the experiences and errors.Immediately before working on Canti di vita e d\'amore, Nono was in residence at the Studio di Fonologia Musicale RAI in Milan composing an electronic piece entitled Omaggio a Emilio Vedova. Vedova, an artist by trade, shared similar political leanings with Nono and they both collaborated on many occasions. According to Irvine, Omaggio a Emilio Vedova contains striking similarities in gesture to the first movement of Canti di vita e d\'amore; indeed the first 20 seconds of the Omaggio seem like a study for the opening 20 seconds of the Canti. It is then not out of the question that, because the opening musical material of both works dealt with the same concepts, Nono (perhaps even unconsciously) was influenced by his memories and experiences with Vedova while writing Canti.'

S' Helmut Lachenmann\'s most well known teacher was Luigi Nono, who he first met in 1957 at the Darmstadt Ferienkurse fr Neue Musik. From 1958 to 1960 he studied with Nono in Venice. At the 2015 highSCORE Festival in Pavia (Italy) Lachenmann was the guest composer and during his lecture he described the influence Nono exerted during this formative period. According to Lachenmann, each lesson he would bring in drafts of what he was working on, and each time Nono would exclaim in frustration that it was too melodic. Or rather, he should abandon melodic lines altogether. For Nono the use, or even reference to melody was too strong an association with those in power during WWII, the "ruling class" who used music within the classical tradition as propaganda. Nono was an adamant supporter and member of the Italian Communist Part since 1952, and viewed any such obvious link to this tradition as a political statement. Thus, the passages that Lachenmann brought in were labelled "bourgeoisie" by Nono.Lachenmann claims that despite his best efforts to eliminate any clear melodies, when he would bring in the revisions Nono would still point out specific measures and, infuriated, repeat that it was bourgeoisie. After some time Lachenmann said that the music he would bring in was entirely void of typical melodies, and yet Nono would find a particular use of a half-step interval to be too bourgeoisie. The way that Lachenmann told this story during his 2015 lecture in Pavia made apparent this experience with Nono was traumatic, and at the same time far reaching in influence. In an attempt to invent what music could be through "emptying" what he already knows (Lachenmann, 2008), he found a new expressivity, a new beauty, which he problematizes in his essay The Beautiful in Music Today:Except for Luigi Nono, leading composers of yesterday have exhausted their resources  They are celebrating the comeback of the bourgeois concept of beauty  a form sickening to anyone who sees in art  or in beauty  more than just a masquerade (Lachenmann, 1980, p. 21).This new approach to expressivity was initially inspired by serialism, first of the Second Viennese School composers (Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, Anton Webern), then the dominant postwar figures of the time (Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen). What serialism offered Lachenmann, according to biographer Ulrich Mosch, was "this concept of sound as the outcome and expression of abstract ideas of order." Another aspect of serialism, as practiced by Boulez and Stockhausen, which may have influenced Lachenmann was the possibility to give greater independence to the various musical characteristics (dynamics, pitches, rhythms, timbres, etc), with the composer calling this the "anatomy" of sound. Mosch points out that for Lachenmann those characteristics "denote the concrete situation: listening, you hear the conditions under which a sound or noise action is carried out, you hear what materials and energies are involved and what resistance is encountered."This concept of concrete listening marked a major turning point in his compositional output, with Pression being the first work where he uses what he calls musique concrte instrumentale. Lachenmanns musique concrte instrumentale was inspired by the technique and approach of French composer Pierre Schaeffers musique concrte coined in 1948. In the article Pression  a performance study, author Tanja Orning states that: [Musique] concrte took what was concrete (recorded sound) and subjected it to a process of abstraction. Schaeffers approach made the sound itself the point of departure by choosing real sounds, existing in the world, collecting, classifying and recording them and thus making them objets musicaux. From the core properties of concrete sounds, he would then build structures into a work, thus reversing the traditional process of composition.It was Lachenmann\'s desire to move this abstraction of real world sounds from recordings to live performance. He believed that this could only be accomplished through utilizing sounds, as Mosch puts it, "unused and hence uncontaminated in the past." Lastly, Lachenmann has spoken of composition as equivalent to building an instrument, and Mosch is quick to point out that "this is as true of his attitude to solo instruments as it is to his approach to ensembles or orchestras." During the 2015 highSCORE lecture Lachenmann used Morton Feldmans piece The Viola in my Life as an example, calling Pression "The Cello in my Life." Orning\'s assessment of Pression corroborates this ideal, as "the cello as the sound source we know is eliminated, so the cello as a traditional instrument with all its connotations and history is on one level erased through this compositional method."'

S' [Image via A Tribute to Fausto Romitelli] Trash TV Trance (2002) represents the intersection of a number of diverse streams of compositional thought. On the one hand there is the overarching aesthetic grounding of his work, which most would classify as modernist. Then there are the genres and subgenres he is, at various times, referencing. These range from the popular idioms of rock (metal, acid, psychedelic, etc) and electronica (often via sampling), to late twentieth century classical movements such as the theater of the absurd and Spectralism. Romitelli combines these, often using timbral saturation to fuse such disparate elements together. Regarding the popular music link in Trash TV Trance, it is difficult to ignore the likeness to certain timbres and electric guitar techniques pioneered by Jimi Hendrix. The defining feature of Hendrix\'s solo lead sound, oversatured distortion constantly on the brink of feedback, is shared here. Other characteristics borrowed from such performances as the Star Spangled Banner at Woodstock and Machine Gun at the Filmore East include a reliance of stomp-box effects pedals (wah-wah, chorus, etc), pick scraping the length of the string, and exaggerated bending/vibrato. In an interview between critic Joseph Dalto and Talea Ensemble\'s Alex Lipowski before a New York concert of Romitelli\'s works, Lipowski also makes several comparisons to Hendrix:He wants you to experience a sensory overload[...] It\'s often thick and dirty, really raw, like psychedelic rock would be[...] You can lose yourself in the music, because it\'s transcendental. So get ready for the Romitelli experience. Like the Jimi Hendrix experience, it will be radical and experimental and hopefully transformative.Along the same lines of hybridisation between contemporary classical music and more popular genres would be John Zorn, particularly his work with Naked City. Though that album was released over a decade before Romitelli completed Trash TV Trance, it is unclear how well Romitelli knew Zorn\'s music. Nevertheless, there is a common aesthetic of dense, loud passages verging on noise-music. In 2012, roughly eight years after Romitelli\'s untimely death, the Talea Ensemble released an album entirely of his music on Tzadik, the record company curated by John Zorn. Frank Zappa could have also influenced Romitelli for the same reasons. In a review of the book Oltre le periferie dellimpero. Omaggio a Fausto Romitelli, Nicol Palazzetti provides a possible musical relationship between these figures:By observing postwar music history and avant-gardes decline, Enrico Girardi points out Romitellis eccentricity as well as his strong relationship with XXth century aesthetics: in order to overcome the homogenisation and academicism of contemporary composers, Romitelli rescues the concepts of commitment, authenticity and critique, as defined by the Italian musical koine of 1950s and 1960s (the so called Fase seconda). Silvia Vizzardelli and Marco Maria Tosolini respectively analyse the concepts of anamorphosis and fall in Romitellian poetics and the parallelism between Romitelli, Zappa and Hendrix.Moving past the shared technical roles of the soloist in Hendrix and Romitelli, there is a different reception of the guitarist by the audience in Trash TV Trance. Apart from the typical venue being a concert hall rather than a rock stage, with Hendrix and Zappa the focus is on the artist as a quasi cult of personality to convey musical drama. When Zorn is performing with Naked City the focus is similar. However, with Romitelli the musicians are ideally existing as conduits for the drama to pass through. Regardless of how absurd their actions may be it is always about the act and not the performer himself/herself. In Trash TV Trance these actions include a circular motion using a drum stick to "bow" the strings on the neck of the instrument. In addition to the specific sound generated by this extended technique, a certain ritualistic quality akin to the fragile monodramas of Mauricio Kagel is created.Regarding Spectralism, after attending at the Accademia Chigiana in Siena and later at the Scuola Civica in Milan, Romitelli continued his studies at IRCAM in Paris. While taking part in IRCAM\'s Cursus program, he was a student of Grard Grisey and Hugues Dufourt, both considered principle figures in the history of Spectral music. According to reviewer Liam Cagney, Dufourt\'s composition Saturne (1979) impressed Romitelli strongly, and later he "forged a connection with the Parisian musical collective lItinraire, who would premiere several of Romitellis works."Lastly, the influence on Romitelli\'s use of saturation may be traced through Gyorgy Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki, Iannis Xenakis, Giacinto Scelsi, and Sonic Youth. In the 1960s saturation was seen in works like Ligeti\'s Lux Aeterna via "micropolyphony," Penderecki\'s Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima via "tone clusters," and Xenakis\' Pithoprakta via "sound-cloud" textures. Though given different technical names, each of these composers is achieving the same sonic resultant, a saturation of the total chromatic through the motion of many independent lines. With the music of Scelsi, such as his String Quartet no.5, he is taking that same instrumental method to saturate a frequency band and compressing it to a much smaller interval, moving from chromatic or dodecaphonic activity to microtonal activity. This microtonal saturation when paired with the sort of raw, "dirty" guitar and amplifier hum/buzz native to a band like Sonic Youth results in the reoccurring gesture seen in the opening to Trash TV Trance.'

S' [Image via Terry Riley Celebration, St George\'s Bristol & Bristol Old Vic | New music reviews, news & interviews]In C (1964) is considered to be the first major work of Minimalism in music. As with many, if not most, stylistic movements in Western music, the fine art world arrived there first. In France between 1947 and 1948, Yves Klein conceived his Monotone Symphony (1949, formally The Monotone-Silence Symphony) that consisted of a single 20-minute sustained chord followed by a 20-minute silence  a precedent to both La Monte Young\'s drone music and John Cage\'s 433. Other New York based artists soon followed suit, for example Frank Stella\'s Die Fahne Hoch! (1959), Ad Reinhardt\'s so-called "black" paintings of the 1960s, and Agnes Martin\'s early 1960s square canvases works that were covered in dense, minute and softly delineated graphite grids. Therefore, it is possible that one influence on the early minimalist composers was indeed not musical, but rather this artistic parallel.It is also possible that Terry Riley was reacting against other dominant compositional styles of the time, with these musics functioning as an influence not to compose in that way, but rather try the opposite. The key composers defining the musical scene in the early 1960s included figures like Elliott Carter, Luciano Berio, and Karlheinz Stockhausen. In the book Terry Riley\'s in C author Robert Carl emphasizes that the composition community of that era valued those who "pushed limits of fixed-score complexity, [regarding this] as the standard for \'advanced\' composition." In the other direction was the unwavering experimentalism of John Cage who, as Carl notes, "had moved music into realms of noise and randomized activity that created often chaotic results." In C is distant to both aesthetics and takes an ideological stance of openness to achieve inclusion and expressive freedom, rather than the total Cageian freedom where human expression is often seen to interfere with how the experiment should naturally play out. Perhaps the most important influence on Riley when creating In C was the 1960s counter-cultural zeitgeist taking place in California. In C was written at the onset of this. However, there were precursors establishing the West Coast as a bastion of anti-Euro-centric thought and the anti-overly systemic institutionalization of composition. Decades earlier John Cage, Harry Partch, and Lou Harrison began to establish California as such. Carl also contributes this "Left Coast," maverick, progressive musical identity to Henry Cowell, stating "Cowell was a prodigious product of Bay Area bohemianism, a sort of musical \'wild child\' whose development would have been far different elsewhere."This atmosphere lines up with Riley\'s musical background. Though both he and La Monte Young were graduates of the American academic system (completing their master\'s studies At UC Berkeley), neither seemed poised to or interested in entering academia. Rather, it was the connections with other composers while at Berkeley that may have informed Riley\'s musical direction. In addition to Young who, according to Carl, shared his ideas of "highly conceptual works in the orbit of Fluxus art," Riley also became friends with Loren Rush and Pauline Oliveros through his mentor Robert Erickson. Lastly, just the act of being an improvising musician could have been a great influence when writing In C. Riley has described the work as "closer to jazz and rock in its sound and in its presentation of a cosmic \'jam.\'" Carl notes that in contrast to Young\'s more theoretical approach to composition, Riley "remained more of a jazzer in his outlook, playing saxophone and keyboards, and improvising as part of his practical, professional life." Furthermore, also while at Berkeley Riley joined Oliveros and Rush to form an improvisation trio, playing piano with the former on French horn and the latter on koto and percussion.'

S' [Image via MERZsonata] Kurt Schwitters\' Ursonate exists as one most important early text performances works. Written between 1922 and 1932 in Hannover, Germany, Schwitters\' efforts may be viewed as coming out of the Dadaist movement. Jaap Blonk, a frequent performer of Ursonate, notes in the September catalog for the exhibition Kurt Schwitters in Norway that Schwitters was refused by the Berlin Dadaists. Following this he started a one-man Dada group in Hannover called Merz. Then in 1919, after gaining a national reputation with the absurd love poem An Anna Blume, he made contact with fellow Dadaists such as Hans Arp and Raoul Hausmann. Though formally trained in the fine arts, Schwitters seems to have been influenced by literature and poetry throughout his life. Blonk points out that opening line to Ursonate (Fumms b w t z Uu, pgiff, kwii Ee) was taken from the two Plakatgedichte (Poster Poems) by Hausmann. Blonk also claims that Schwitters used phrases such as this to provoke audiences at literary salons, who expected traditional romantic poetry, by endlessly repeating them in many different voices. This German salon atmosphere relates to other potential influences, such as Sprechgesang. In the article Text-Sound Art: A Survey, author Richard Kostelanetz highlights the similarities between Ursonate and Arnold Schoenberg\'s use of Sprechgesang, stating that both may have been influenced by German cabaret singing, and Chinese and Korean opera. In these styles, as Kostelanetz puts it, the singing voice touches a note but does not sustain the pitch in the course of enunciating the word. In practice, this technique minimizes the importance of musical tone (and, thus, of melody) and, by contrast, emphasizes the word.The era from the late nineteen-teens through the early nineteen-thirties was quite a fertile time for text-sound works, with practitioners taking cues from the development of abstraction, or non-representational art. The writer Hugo Ball, himself a prominent practitioner, said in a 1917 lecture that painter and art theorist Wassily Kandinsky, in his book Der gelbe Klang (1912), "was the first to discover and apply the most abstract expression of sound in language, consisting of harmonized vowels and consonants." Throughout the article Kostelanetz mentions a number of other pieces as possible influences on Schwitters either predating or concurrent with Ursonate. For instance, the German poets Paul Scheerbart and Christian Morgenstern wrote "Kikakoku!//Ekoralaps!" in 1897 and "Das Grosse Lalula" in 1905 respectively. In terms of form, Ursonate has a structure similar to that of a classical sonata or symphony. It consists of four movements: Erster Teil ("First Part"), Largo, Scherzo and Presto. This Classical Era structure then shows a clear influence of the major composers of that time: Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven, et al. Schwitters further references the Classical Era in relation to Ursonate by calling it a sonata in his concluding program note in the 1932 Merz publication. According to Nancy Perloff in the article Archives, Collections and Curatorship Schwitters Redesigned: A Post-war Ursonate from the Getty Archives, the composer states Listening to the sonata is better than reading it. This is why I like to perform my sonata in public.'

S' [image via Beethoven\'s Symphonies: Where To Start]Perhaps this was not the intent of the question, however, I read "just a great composer" to be trivializing in tone. Is there something wrong with just being a great composer? Composing is not an easy profession, and composing in a way that leaves a substantial mark on the history of Western music is immeasurably harder still. I find that all biographies of major historical figures in music to be questionable to some degree. How could I be inspired by Beethoven\'s life, when I have no idea what he was really like? Which account am I supposed to believe? No matter how faithful the author (or in the case of films, director) attempts to be, there are simply too many fictitious, often Romanticized versions of Beethoven out there. The closest thing to truth is the catalog of works he left behind. Many of his original manuscripts still exist and function as a document of his intent. This is the definitive Beethoven.Therefore, I do not view Beethoven to be anything more or less than a great composer. To be a great composer is in fact high praise, and to be considered one of the greatest composers of all time by musicians and non-musicians alike is perhaps the highest praise anyone devoting their life to composition could hope for.'

S' [image via John Zorn 60th Birthday, Jazz on 3 - BBC Radio 3] John Zorn\'s Snagglepuss is perhaps the epitome of polystylism amongst concert works in the late twentieth century. With polystylism, as utilized by Zorn, the influences are necessarily clear in order to provide the listener with a sense of what is being referenced. Furthermore, in Snagglepuss each stylistic outburst must be instantly recognizable, because in order to function as an outburst the durations are inherently quite short. Speed is a crucial factor for Zorn and in the 1998 book John Zorn: Itinerari Oltre Il Suono he said: I believe that in a technological situation like the present one, where we are exposed to thousands of stimuli and in which information moves faster and faster, it is necessary to keep up with these things: it is a way of life and of thinking and we have to come to terms with it.Unlike other post-modern compositions drawing upon many diverse sources ironically, Zorn\'s inclusion of each musical genre is out of genuine admiration. This admiration is evidenced in his prolific recording output, whereby over decades he has released albums focusing on each of the genres he then references in his polystylistic compositions. In the article Nine Aspects of Beauty Appropriation, Lindsay Vickery outlines how these outbursts constitute the form of the work:In the Naked City work Snagglepuss (1989) the band flips through 26 changes in the Space of 2 minutes and 14 seconds. Their performance takes in a minimum of 15 styles of ranging from Curtis Mayfield, to TV themes, Thrash and the visual instruction Drunk falls Downstairs. The players must use all of their skill to make live transitions that are both abrupt and smooth, contrasting but homogenous. They are taking the sample culture made possible through electronic manipulation and drawing it back into the human domain. Naked City celebrates a kind of Pop culture exuberance or Culture Jamming at its most virtuosic.To elaborate on Vickery\'s observations, other likely influences on Zorn during the creation of Snagglepuss include hardcore, film scores, and free jazz. Japanese vocalist Yamataka Eye contributed to the album Naked City, as well as a number of other Zorn projects. Eye\'s hardcore/noise specialization brought a raw intensity that hits a nerve with the listener in a way purely instrumental music is unable to due to the inextricable humanity of the voice. In the 2002 documentary A Bookshelf On Top of the Sky: 12 Stories About John Zorn it is clear from the performances and interviews that Zorn had gone through a phase he describes as obsessed with the hardcore genre. In the album notes, Zorn gives special thanks Japanese-US-UK Hardcore Triangle, Extreme Noise Terror, Agnostic Front, and Napalm Death.Similarly, Zorn has expressed a parallel obsession with cinema, particularly the films of Jean Luc Godard and the French New Wave. Earlier Zorn albums confront this influence in more detail such as Godard (1985), as well as other cinematic genres like the spaghetti western via reworking Ennio Morricone\'s The Big Gundown. The presence of film music in the album Naked City also goes beyond Snagglepuss with other tracks being covers like "The Sicilian Clan" (Ennio Morricone), "A Shot in the Dark" (Henry Mancini), "Chinatown" (Jerry Goldsmith), and "The James Bond Theme" (John Barry). In A Bookshelf On Top of the Sky, Zorn mentions that "Bernard Herrmann is one of my favorite composers, and there is an element of Bernard Herrmann in almost all of my music. "At the onset of his professional career, Zorn was most well known for his free jazz efforts. In Snagglepuss the role of free jazz is notable and, when combine with the noise music of Yamataka Eye, creates the most memorable passages from the unrelenting, visceral nature of the sound. In a 1998 interview with Wilkowski in Rockers, Jazzbos & Visionaries, Zorn mentions that he started playing the saxophone after discovering Anthony Braxton\'s album For Alto(1969), a seminal recording with each track dedicated to a groundbreaking icon of the avant garde movement (John Cage, Cecil Taylor, Leroy Jenkins, etc). Of this group of free jazz innovators, Zorns music is most closely associated with Ornette Coleman, whose 1960 album Free Jazz gave rise to the term. In addition to the Ornette Coleman cover of Lonely Woman on Naked City, Zorn recorded the album Spy vs Spy: The Music of Ornette Colemanin 1989 featuring the compositions of Coleman performed in the brief intense style of Zorn\'s hardcore miniatures (akin to the outbursts in Snagglepuss).In A Bookshelf On Top of the Sky, Zorn expressed that he has for a long time been influenced by Charles Ives and cartoon music, especially the work of Carl Stalling of Wile Coyote and The Roadrunner notability. According to Zorn, both Ives and Stalling display a level playing field for every genre to coexist in, no style or practice is used in a way to imply elitism or division between low art and high art.Lastly, there is the possibility that Zorn was indeed influenced by other composers working with polystylism. In the 1971 essay "Polystylistic Tendencies in Modern Music" author Alfred Schnittke, himself considered to be a leading figure in polystylism, cites the a number of composers utilizing this concept in their work(s). Of these I can hear similarities between Luciano Berio (the third movement of his Sinfonia), Alfred Schnittke (Concerto Grosso no.1), Mauricio Kagel (Ludwig van), Carl Orff (Carmina Burana), Krzysztof Penderecki (St. Luke Passion), Karlheinz Stockhausen (Hymen), and Igor Stravinsky (Pulcinella). Zorn describes in A Bookshelf On Top of the Sky an affinity for block form as used by Stravinsky and later Stockhausen. Zorn calls this "moment form, where each moment is complete in itself, like building blocks. And the moments are positioned one after another in a linear fashion so it ends up telling a story."After the recording of the band\'s debut Naked City others influences would resurface on the band\'s next full-length release, Grand Guignol (1992), which also included performances of works by Claude Debussy, Alexander Scriabin, Orlande de Lassus, and Olivier Messiaen. It is unclear of much the musics of these composers influenced the construction of Snagglepuss.'

S" [image via Georg Friedrich Haas] The clearest compositional influence seen in Georg Friedrich Haas' Limited Approximations (2010) is Ivan Wyschnegradsky's arc-en-ciel (1956).Limited Approximations was premiered at Donaueschingen (Germany) 17 October 2010 and programmed in a concert immediately following a performance of  arc-en-ciel. In his paper Some Theoretical Attributes of 72-tone Equal Temperament and Their Realization in Georg Friedrich Haas' limited approximations, Will Mason also details the significance of composer Ivan Wyschnegradsky's arc-en-cielas a historical precursor in the six piano 72 EDO realm. Mason contextualizes Limited Approximations as, in part, a homage to Wyschnegradsky and mentions Haas' use of Wyschnegradskys method of modulation in quarter-tone pitch space and his idiosyncratic use of a chord of stacked fourths and tritones. In the program note (Universal Edition), Haas also cites the specific influence of Wyschnegradsky on Limited Approximations: At the end, a quotation from Ivan Vishnegradskys harmonies (against the relics of an overtone chord in the strings)  not with the clarity of his composition arc-en-ciel (I was able to premire this work for 6 pianos tuned in twelfth-tone intervals in 1988) but in the clouding over of twelfth-tone chords gliding gently towards the heavens. Even this approximation is only a limited one.Beyond the specifics of arc-en-ciel, Haas was also greatly influenced by the composer's musical philosophies, stating in Balint A. Varga's 2013 book Three Questions for Sixty-Five Composers: Ivan Wyschnegradsky's espaces non-octaviants (non-octaviating spaces) may not be a composition, merely a textural principle. Still  this principle has exerted a decisive influence on my musical thinking: networks of intervals which stretch over the entire audible space and extend (virtually) into the no longer audible realm (ultra- and infrasound). The octaves loses in the process the function it possessed up to that point in music history. The musics of Gyorgy Ligeti and Giacinto Scelsi are also audible influences in the composition of Limited Approximations. For Ligeti it is via the dense textures created in the orchestra by means of individual lines. Music critic Ung-Aang Talay also notes in the Bangkok Post the relationship between Haas' treatment of the orchestra and the 1960s, pieces like Atmospheres and Lontano that releases a dense bands of constantly shifting blocks of highly-spiced sound. What Ligeti has applied to the vastness of the symphony orchestra, Scelsi has applied to small chamber groups-- expressing the same sense of friction from melodies being compressed into incomparably small microtonal intervals. Haas further describes the influence of Scelsi in Three Questions for Sixty-Five Composers: [In] listening to a concert at the Graz Musikprotokoll festival that was devoted exclusively to his compositions and lasted several hours, I realized that he shaped sonority as such, purely as a sounding process, evolving instant by instant. Those apparently freely flowing spaces where the difference in the richness of beat in more or less neighboring tones creates a depth and an intensity which for me, up to that moment, had been unheard of, gripped me  I sensed the necessity to take up in my work where Scelsi had left off. The last major influence would be through figures composing with overtone chords in mind, both considered spectral (Tristan Murail) and not (Harry Partch, James Tenney, La Monte Young). Though often cited as a leading spectralist figure, Haas has stated in an interview (5 Questions for Georg Friedrich Haas) with Sam Reising on the website I CARE IF YOU LISTEN:I do not feel myself as a spectral composer. I use some chords, which have relationships to the harmonic series. I use them because I love them and because they sound great. But I never used spectral analyses [...] I trust my sensations. I try to find out how sound and colour and time and dynamics fit together. I do not have any system. I do not trust systems at all.Nevertheless, the ideas put forth by spectral composers have been important in Haas' own compositional practice. He has further explained the creative relationship he has with spectral concepts in the Three Questions for Sixty-Five Composers:Creative processes are sometimes set in train by verbal statements by composers which may have rather an intriguing relationship with the compositions to which they refer. I remember a fascinating lecture by Tristan Murail in Darmstadt: the orchestral work which was subsequently performed was markedly different from what I had expected on the strength of the lecture. I realized much later that the pieces which correspond to what I had expected from Murail would need to be composed by myself. Regarding Partch, Tenney, and Young, their use of the harmonies that deviate from the conventional tempered scale influenced Haas immensely. He was particularly interested in the twelfth-tones and even smaller intervals up to the quarter-tone when conceiving the six piano turnings in Limited Approximation. In an article with IRCAM Haas claims that the overtone chords, as crafted by Partch et al., contain these microtones do not sound wrong here but, rather, soft and melting, since they can be derived directly from the acoustic principles of instrumental sound."

S' [Image via Acousmata]In 1971 Lewis, a Chicago native, became a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), a non-profit organization founded in Chicago. The AACM was formed in May 1965 by a group of musicians centered on pianist Muhal Richard Abrams who had organized an Experimental Band since 1962. In addition to Abrams, other early members that Lewis would have frequently performed/improvised with included (in no particular order): Wadada Leo Smith, trumpet; Leroy Jenkins, violin; Anthony Braxton, saxophone/clarinet; Roscoe Mitchell, saxophone; and Douglas Ewart, winds; among others. Ewart recorded the album Homage to Charles Parker in 1979 with Lewis. Though it is unclear if and how the music of Charlie Parker shaped Lewis\' conception of Voyager, it is likely that Parker\'s idiosyncrasies as a player influenced Lewis\' practice, phrasing, and pacing on the trombone. This long-time involvement with the AACM makes up one of Lewis\' core identities as a musician, and in May of 2008 Lewis published a book about the organization through the University of Chicago Press entitled A Power Stronger Than Itself: The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians.The avant garde jazz aesthetic throughout much of the AACM concerts could have further informed versions of Voyager. The most famous recording, the solo takes with Lewis and Mitchell for the 1993 Avant release, is very much in the avant garde jazz / free improvisation vein. This aesthetic predisposition is not necessarily inherent to the construction of Voyager, but has nevertheless become commonplace with its performances. According to Lewis the Voyager program analyzes aspects of an improvisors performance in real time then generates complex responses to the musicians playing. If you want to hear the program play in a certain way, you figure out how what you want to hear is organized, and you start playing that way yourself. If one could play in any style to try and elicit a like response from the program, why is the avant garde jazz approach de facto in performances of Voyager? A musician could just as well freely improvise within a hard rock, blues, bluegrass, folk, etc. idiom and still work within the intended construct of Voyager. It is the decades of shared influence among the members of the AACM, who do maintain particular aesthetic leaning on their chosen instruments, that has, intentionally or not, established a precedent for how Voyager should sound. With the composer also existing as frequent performer of the work, his aesthetic decisions further emphasized as authoritative, despite the lack of formal instruction or restriction when approaching a new improvisation. The aspect of creating a software that responds in a musical way can be seen as part of the instrument building tradition with the AACM, and later the Art Ensemble of Chicago (AEC). It was standard for members of these groups to take on many creative roles-- composer, multi-instrumentalist, improvisor, bandleader, inventor, craftsman, and even programmer. In the artistic communities of the AACM and AEC where designing new objects of interaction (what they termed "little instruments") from bicycle horns, bells, birthday party noisemakers, wind chimes, and a vast array of percussion instruments (such as found objects) was ubiquitous, it then comes as little surprise that Lewis took such ingenuity to the next logical step with Voyager through the use of computers. Not only can this environment of instrument building be seen as an influence, but even the technology itself plays an important role in the development of Voyager. Lewis has stated that the Voyager project was started during 1985-86, while he was composer-in-residence at the Studio voor Elektro-Instrumentale Muziekin Amsterdam. The staff of STEIM at the time included Michel Waisvisz, Nico Bes, Gabrie Lantinga, and Misha Mengelberg. It is unclear how much interaction Lewis had with these individuals on a creative basis, though it is plausible that certain aspects of the program could have been due to their influence. Early versions ofVoyager were originally developed for and programmed on the Yamaha CX-5 computer by Lewis, using a special version of FIG-Forth developed for that underpowered machine by STEIMs technical director, Joel Ryan. As more advanced hardware and software became available the requirements to stage a performance of Voyager were naturally influenced by these new breakthroughs. Lewis has this timeline of technological progress on the Voyager project--The first complete versions of Voyager for the more powerful Atari ST series of computers, were finished in 1987 in New York City, as usual under extreme budgetary constraints. This version was written in Mach 2 Forth-83. Both of these early versions used a simple realtime scheduler of my own design. The versions of the Voyager software heard on this recording was designed and written by George E. Lewis, using Forthmacs, a version of Forth-83 written by Mitch Bradley, and MacMox 1.4, a real-time scheduler and MIDI parsing program built by Danile J. Scheidt. Some Forth words designed by Phil Burk for use with the Hierarchical Music Specification Language were also used in this version of Voyager; I hope he wont mind.Software for the session ran on a single Apple Macintosh Powerbook; both the 145 and 180 models were successfully employed. A Sony lavalier microphone was used to capture the sound of the instruments. An IVL model 4000 Pitchrider was used to convert this audio to a form that the software could process. The instruments played by the software was an Emu Proteus/2 sample player and synthesizer. The software has 12 instrumental channels at its disposal at any one time. Any one of the 45 Proteus instruments (timbres) that I chose for the recording can be selected by any instrumental channel.Lastly, other likely influences during the composition of Voyager include pianist Cecil Taylor and composer/saxophonist John Zorn. Taylor\'s work in the 1960s to expand the landscape of jazz into regions of increasing complexity and freer improvisations, as seen with Unit Structures (1966), contribute to the compositional style and musical language Lewis would later explore in Voyager. Both Chicagoans, Taylor and Lewis would go on to perform together in a number of contexts, perhaps most notably through their shared involvement with AEC. During the 2015 Ostrava Days Composition Institute Lewis mentioned how he had played Cobra, the game piece, with John Zorn. Cobra predates Voyager by a few years, and there are game-like elements in Voyager such as the performer trying to figure out how what you want to hear is organized, and you start playing that way yourself.'

S'  Alvin Lucier was a founding member of the Sonic Arts Union (1966-1976) with Robert Ashley, David Behrman, and Gordon Mumma. The element uniting the works by these individual composers, according to David Behrman, was the desire to create pieces "in which established techniques were thrown away and the nature of sound was dealt with from scratch" (Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition, 266). Therefore, it is likely that during this decade of working and performing together, the members of the Sonic Arts Union influenced each other. Lucier\'s I am sitting in a room is the perfect example of what Behrman describes as dealing with the nature of sound from scratch. Furthermore, in Background Noise, Robert Ashley\'s work The Wolfman is portrayed in several ways as a precursor to I am sitting in a room:The stutter in this case is a form of controlled feedback: it comes back to haunt Lucier, yet to a point of comfort and composition, where the composer may reside, take up home, within his own somatic tick, similar to Robert Ashley\'s work The Wolfman, from 1964, where voice unleashes a form of controlled and harmonic noise. Combining vocalization with audio feedback, as well as prepared audio tapes, The Wolfman creates a sonic journey in which electronic noise, as a total excess of timbral materiality, creates musical form: Ashley\'s vocalizations initiate waves of feedback that fill a space with itself, returning to the composer a harsh duet. Ashley\'s Wolfman operates as a doppleganger, an alter ego shadowing his own articulations, literally, a hybrid monster, part-human and part-animal. Such hybridity find another form in I am sitting in a room: here, architectural space and individual body merge, creating other forms of being and speaking (129).Also detailed in Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition was how the success that John Cage and David Tudor had in touring and designing their own equipment served as an early inspiration for the Sonic Arts Union (199-205). The influence of Cage, however, extends far beyond his time with the Sonic Arts Union. Lucier noted during his lecture at the 2015 Ostrava Days Composition Institute that Cage exerted a sort of cult of personality amongst the experimental music scene in the 1960s. Lucier expressed great admiration for Cage\'s compositional philosophies, particularly that he is not interested in forcing musical relationships, but wishes to just allow the natural phenomena to happen. Regarding the specific work I am sitting in a room, Lucier explained during the same lecture that the indeterminate aspects described in the preface (i.e. allowing for any text, in any language, repeated any number of times, in any space) was a direct result of Cage\'s influence. Lucier went so far as to say: It was a product of the times, it was trendy and pretentious to make prose scores contain indeterminate aspects [] it was a mistake. I believe Lucier\'s true intent for how the work should exist can be seen in the composer\'s own performances. He is not laissez faire about the resulting sound, as the open instructions may have one to believe. Instead, it is clear Lucier is looking for a certain, highly particular result. For example, if the room was too reverberant and the text was becoming unintelligible too quickly, Lucier would get up and move the microphone closer to the loudspeaker to mitigate the process. Despite the imprint of Cage\'s style on the conception for I am sitting in a room, Lucier states that Cage was highly critical of the work, disliking that the narration states what will happen in the composition. Cage continued by calling this descriptive text as composition and generalized that Lucier\'s music was cause and effect. Cage also thought that the text for I am sitting in a room was too personal and the location of the 1980 recording, the living room of Lucier\'s home in Middletown, CT, was again too personal. Background Noise also details how I am sitting in a room can also be heard as an extension of Minimalist music, as in the works of La Monte Young, in so far as it develops a sonic palette distinct from traditional notions of musicality through investigating physical phenomena, as in the activation of spatial resonance (128). Author Brandon LaBelle expounds on this influence, stating that:[...] Lucier infiltrates Young\'s Dream House, making it a haunted house, whereby phenomenological fact becomes psychological unease; psychoacoustical listening, a sonorous envelope pricked with desire. The liberated sound of Cage, and the phenomenal aesthetic of Minimalism, is on the surface of Lucier, yet what\'s underneath is the intersection of one man\'s voice with his immediate environment in which those whistling tones are neither just any or all of the resonances, but only those that are share by both the voice and the room (131-132).'

S" The underlying implication within the question, that Chopin and Mozart are similar composers for the piano, makes their combined characteristics difficult to find in any one modern composer. This is not a slight against contemporary composers who write for the piano. Rather, as I mentioned in a previous question (Who are composers similar in style to Frdric Chopin and Claude Debussy?), these example figures do not strike me to have much in common. Mozart was a central figure of the Classical Era and lived from 1756-1791. Chopin was a central figure of the Romantic Era and lived from 1810-1849. As you can see, their timelines do not overlap at all. Mozart was born in Salzburg, Austria and spent most of his professional career in Vienna, Austria. Chopin was born in Zelazowa Wola near Warsaw, Poland and spent most of his professional career in Paris, France.Mozart composed prolifically and produced works in every popular genre of his time and place. His operas and symphonies are likely his most well known, both today and during his lifetime. Chopin, though no slouch in output, composed far less and across substantially fewer genres. All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either piano concertos, songs or chamber music.Chopin, during the last 18 years of his life, he gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. Mozart was far less reclusive with regards to public performance and was known to play piano (and occasionally violin/viola) in a number of concerti, solo recital, and chamber music contexts. Given their different music eras it would make sense that each composer had different identifying features in their piano music. Mozart epitomizes clarity of line and form. Chopin, often in an effort to gain greater expressiveness, blurred elements of traditional forms (ex. Fantaisie Impromptu Op 66). Mozart used ornamentation and virtuosic flairs in his piano writing, but again, stuck within the accepted practice of his time. Chopin utilized ornamentation heavily, often embellishing simple melodies on the piano with extensive chromatic grace note passages. Chopin's works often demand substantial physical technique from the pianist. Although both composers treated the instrument with great subtlety and athleticism, the finger independence is much greater in Chopin's show pieces.Nevertheless, there are a few commonalities. Both composers had musician parents, were considered child prodigies, toured Europe as soloists, and died relatively young (Mozart at age 35, Chopin at age 39). However more importantly both: (1) composed a huge catalog of works for the piano including technical studies, (2) had many of their piano compositions enter into the standard concert repertoire, and (3) were highly regarded performers on the instrument, premiering their own pieces. David Rakowski. He is most well-known for his set of 100 high-energy piano tudes, which are regularly performed worldwide. He is currently at work on a parallel set of 100 piano prludes, of which 46 have been written.It is often hard to tell if a living composer's works will enter into the repertoire. With that being said, here are a few contemporary pieces that seem to be quite popular with performers recently: Philip Glass - Metamorphosis (1989), John Adams - Phrygian Gates and China Gates (1977), Steve Reich - Piano Phase (1967), and Helmut Lachenmann - Guero (1970).In recent decades the composer-soloist has become increasingly rare, as the dedication required to be competitive as a professional composer and a concert pianist is substantial (and often with little overlap). Our modern age frequently encourages specialization over the notion of the Renaissance Man. Musically speaking, Mozart would be more in-line with the Renaissance Man ideal, whereas Chopin functioned more as a specialist. Here are a few contemporary figures who have been able to sustain parallel careers as composer and performers on the piano (in no particular order): Thomas Ads, Timo Andres, Frederic Rzewski, Eric Wubbels, Michael Hersch, William Bolcom, and Michael Finnissy."

S' Image via http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/... Johann Sebastian Bach certainly did consume alcohol and, though I am not sure if you are thinking of illicit drugs today, he did take in quite a bit of caffeine daily in the form of coffee.Beer and WineJohn Eliot Gardiner, famed Bach conductor and president of the Bach-Archiv Leipzig, authored a book in 2013 emphasizing that the composer was not some sort of saintly figure above common indulgences. In Bach: Music in the Castle of Heaven Gardiner writes of J.S. Bach\'s school boy days at Eisenach:[...] Research begun in the 1930s in the town archives by Hermann Helmbold, and in the 1990s by Rainer Kaiser, paints a very different picture, suggesting that the Eisenach boys of the time were typical ruffians: rowdy, subversive, thuggish, beer- and wine-loving, girl-chasing, known for breaking windows and brandishing their daggers to impress.It seems that in adulthood the composer\'s penchant to imbibe did not at all subside. Gardiner details one event where communal inebriation was even a goal of the evening for Bach, in this case to gain information regarding a musical post:[... This] rosy image could have been shattered when Bach and Kuhnau met face to face in April 1716 as joint assessor of a new organ in Halle. We have a detailed menu of the sumptuous dinner that they consumed at the Golden Ring tavern, which together with the lavish quantity of wine and beer set before them, may have been enough to loosen Kuhnau\'s tongue as to the pitfalls of the job [...]Furthermore, in 2014 there was an event, Bachfest: Bach and Beer, where historian Bob Winn, noted beer authority Jay R. Brooks, and scholar/pianist Susan Waterfall covered life in early 18th century Germany, an overview of Bachs life, and beer making in Bachs time. On their webpage the organizers state: "J. S. Bach enjoyed life enormously, and this certainly included beer drinking. He was often paid in beer."Coffee Though Bach may have maintained a fondness for alcohol, his true liquid vice was coffee. In fact, he was such a coffee aficionado that he even composed a large form comic work about it, the closest the composer ever came to writing an opera. Schweigt stille, plaudert nicht BWV 211, also known as the Coffee Cantata, is a secular cantata composed between 1732-1735 and functions as a satirical commentary telling of coffee addition. Blair Johnston summarizes the plot in the work\'s AllMusic entry:The citizens of Leipzig, the city that Bach called home from 1723 on, were by all accounts especially enamored of this new, stimulating, and as some people of the time felt, dangerous beverage; in the Coffee Cantata, a concerned Leipzig father seeks to break his daughter from her addiction to it. Finally, by threat of preventing her from marrying, he succeeds in doing so; but after he leaves to find a husband for her, she turns full circle and proclaims that no suitor need bother her unless he is willing to insert a clause into the marriage contract that she can make coffee whenever and however she pleases! Lastly, it appears that the work was premiered by The Collegium Musicum, an ensemble conducted by Bach and based in a storied Zimmermans coffee house in Leipzig, Germany. The libretto was written by Christian Friedrich Henrici, known as Picander, and features lines like-- "If I couldn\'t, three times a day, be allowed to drink my little cup of coffee, in my anguish I will turn into a shriveled-up roast goat".'

S' Deconstructing the Technology in Idle ChatterAt its source, the voice heard in the Idle Chatter series of works by Paul Lansky is his wife Hannah MacKay. After recording the spoken text, text that is not ever revealed by the composer, MacKay\'s voice is used with a Linear Prediction Coding (LPC) algorithm. According to Lansky in a conversation with Jeffrey Perry published in Perspectives of New Music (1996), the Linear Predictive Coding rapidly changes banks of formant filters. Lansky goes on to say-- I just isolate words, sort of flatten the pitch contours a bit, and then transpose them. The sustained stuff is done with granular synthesis. Joseph Rothstein in his review of Idle Chatter from Computer Music Journal\'s Autumn 1995 issue points out that a variety of stochastic mixing techniques were also utilized by Lansky. How the Voice is Developed and Degraded in Seminal Speech WorksWhen compared to the speech works I previously discussed (I Am Sitting in a Room; Mortuos Plango, Vivos Voco; and Come Out), Idle Chatter takes a different approach to formal development and vocal transformations. First, the speech is never fully intelligible. One instantly recognizes it as sounds from a human\'s voice, even more specifically an adult woman\'s voice. However, due to the constant fragmentation of words, the syntactic meaning is obscured. As the playback continues and many of the samples become familiar, albeit retaining their functionality as novel utterances. It is this false familiarity that causes listeners to question what exactly they are hearing: Was that bear or there? I was certain the last time it was said the sounds was closer to bear, but now I am not so sure. Are these utterances changing or is my perception of them changing?All of the other aforementioned analyzed works deal with the loss of intelligibility, but as an arrival point along a continuum. They all begin with clarity of meaning and perhaps even intent. The loss of intelligibility and proportional increase in text ambiguity is at the core of each composition\'s musical development. For I am sitting in a room the spoken prose is entirely unaffected during the first iteration, as it is simply a performer speaking (usually predetermined text meant for clear comprehension) in an ordinary resonant space. Through re-recording the playback of the speech within the same space again and again the voice looses it\'s identifying articulations and becomes a featureless contour by the nth iteration. Though the audibility of the text as such is lost at this point, the process is dependent on repetition, and thus it is understood that the same text is being stated (re-stated) in the same space. This is not to say that there meaning is unwavering. Striping the audibility of the text over the course a performance carries implications of death, loss, voicelessness, and so forth. For Mortuos Plango, Vivos Voco, Harvey\'s son, a chorister, is heard throughout the work. During the first section the sung text, taken from the Latin inscription from the Winchester tenor bell, is clearly intelligible with the only obstruction toward easy comprehension being the non-native aspect of the Latin language. As the work progresses, Harvey transitions between the various transpositions of the real recorded singing and the synthesized, fake vocal line. The gradual approach of the fake from the real creates moments within gestures of immense ambiguity. This is further emphasized when paired with the real (pre-recorded) and fake (synthesized) tenor bell sounds. Motion between these diametrically opposed materials, human and digital, provides more directional freedom than is heard in I am sitting in a room. The decay of language comprehension is no longer an inevitable slide from clarity to syntactic opacity. Rather, Harvey is able to move in either way from pure, sine tone based lines modeled after the voice\'s overtones to the real voice, complete with text and articulation. Unlike I am sitting in a room and similar to Idle Chatter, Mortuos Plango uses fragmentation and reordering of the chorister sound samples, further obscuring the distorting the original meaning of the text. For Come Out the relationship between the voice and text is somewhere between the linear (A transitioning to B) I am sitting in a room and the multi-directional/fragmented (A to B, B to A, A-B-A, B-A-B, etc) Mortuos Plango, Vivos Voco. Come Out functions with a strict process piece identity and an inevitability of outcome shared with I am sitting in a room, but also maintains the fragmentation, reordering of phrases, and multi-directionality of Mortuos Plango Vivos Voco. One could even compare the sections of heightened ambiguity of comprehending what the exact text is (come out to show them) with parts of Idle Chatter where the text is creating equally ambiguous novel words existing in the margins of intelligibility (there vs. bear). Another quality differentiating Come Out from the other works is the lack of acoustic (timbral) transformation in the voice even during sections of great syntactic ambiguity. Since there is no electronic processing of any kind and the development is achieved by means of phasing duplicate copies of the vocal sample, the ambiguity arises out of the inevitable overlapping of different rhythms set to different words. Lastly, the sheer rate and relentlessness of the sample repetition causes a loss of meaning in the text. To hear the same phrase again and again, unaltered (only rhythmically offset), forces a different kind of listening and is often compared to a trance or meditation. The essence of the phrase is retained as a long form focal point and the details, the meaning and syntactical content in this case, are slowly and progressively disregarded perceptually despite their omnipresence in the texture. How then does Lansky achieve development in Idle Chatter when syntactic ambiguity is unwavering? Despite the voice and text being in a continuous state of communicative opacity, Lansky is able to effectively create a sense of contrasting sections through the use of different orchestrational techniques and through traditional harmonic motion. In his review of the work in the autumn 1995 issue of Computer Music Journal, Joseph Rothstein highlights the role of orchestration, stating: In the foreground, a steady stream of energetic babble captures our attention, while in the background, a chorus of processed \'background singers\' wordlessly provides a restful contrast [] In the first, the chorus seems to explode softly from the background, punctuating the chatter with terse comments. Regarding tonal harmonies, Lansky has said in a number of interviews that Idle Chatter was his first tonal composition. The traditional harmonies here function to curate the listener\'s focus over the duration of the work. This curation, moving from one aspect to another, contributes greatly to a sense of development. Lansky emphasizes this in the interview with Joshua Cody (Computer Music Journal, Spring 1996):I wanted to simplify certain aspects of the sound to allow myself to concentrate upon certain other aspects. In a way, I\'m being evasive by using tonal textures. I didn\'t want to present a context in which one not only had to parse a complicated timbral texture and a complicated rhythmic texture, but also a complicated pitch texture.[ For Idle Chatter] I had lots of voices going all over the place, chattering right and left. To make any sense of it, I found I had to simplify the pitch structure. When I was working on it I started out using fairly complicated pitch structures, and found that the listening experience proved to be utterly exhausting. I just got tired, and I couldn\'t really deal with it. The chattering became chaotic. As soon as I decided to place a B-flat triad in the background, I found myself able to listen to all kinds of things and fascinating qualities emerged. There is kind of a didactic twist to this, for what it\'s worth. In a way I\'m sitting the listener down in a familiar place and then tweaking his ears with a more bizarre context. In this case B flat major is perhaps acting more as a foundation for exploration than as an assertion that tonality has God-given virtue. The Often Mechanical Approaches to the Voice (Relinquishing Control vs. Intervening Craft) A major commonality amongst these works is the reliance (to varying degrees) on compositional processes or systems, relinquishing creative control over certain micro level aspects. I am sitting in a room has no intervention by the composer on how the material is crafted, only the concept of the work itself features decision making solely allocated to Lucier. The choice of text, though often is Lucier\'s in practice, need not be. Likewise, the number of playback iterations is frequently approximated to match Lucier\'s recordings, but again need not. Thus, the only control the composer retains is through the certainty of a given speech\'s loss of articulation and linguistic comprehension through the acoustics of a physical space over time. Of the four works, Harvey retains the most creative control at the micro-level with Mortuos Plango, Vivos Voco; crafting each individual gesture intuitively. Nevertheless, there are still several compositional systems the composer relies on. The large-scale pitch structure is mapped from the Winchester tenor bell overtones. Thus, a vertical harmony becomes a horizontal melodic line. Similarly, the lowest eight harmonics present in this pure bell instance are used as pitch centers for the eight sections constituting the work. Each of these harmonics relate not only to the pitch material, but also to the duration of each section (i.e. the higher the partial, the shorter the duration and vice versa). In recapping, the proportions, harmonies, and fully fleshed-out melodies (excluding the subsequent melodic fragmentation) are all taken from the source sounds of the tenor bell and (to a lesser extent) the chorister recording. Reich maintains a similar approach to Lucier\'s I am sitting in a room with regards to creative intervention within the processes of Come Out. A concept is established and once the materials are properly set up the piece plays out with little intervention or decision making by the composer. Indeterminate parameters seen in I am sitting in a room are, however, replaced in Come Out with carefully chosen concrete instructions and treatments. The text is not only a required selection by Reich but also the specific excerpts which are then used as samples ad nauseam. These samples are intuitively spliced by the composer, and the points of phase, though appearing to be perfect mathematical ratios in duration, were intuitively approximated as well. These decisions (especially the particular length of each sample spliced from the tape reel), though lacking continual intervention as the work progresses, do fundamentally shape the moment-by-moment outcomes, altering both the text comprehension and the composition in its entirety. A slight lengthening or shortening of any section of the vocal statement would compound over time and phase, changing one\'s highly tuned perceptual experience as a listener and speaker of language even with the process itself unaffected. Regarding Idle Chatter, Lansky stated in the Jeffrey Perry / Perspectives of New Music conversation that the bulk of the detail work is done with a kind of algorithmic composition. I don\'t actually decide what notes goes where, I use a random probability method that scatters them with a fair degree of consistency. That works pretty well  I do it a lot. Introducing a random scatter of attacks further disrupts any effort to understand the voice as communication. Language is not random, and due to the highly structured and predictable nature of language one may impose such expectations on the voice in Idle Chatter. Listeners fit the randomized fragments into preexisting forms that logically constitute language. As a result, even though Lansky has carefully curated the points of focus for each section, what the listeners interpret and contextualize the randomness as is dependent on the individual. Lansky had expressed to Jeffrey Perry that he was very startled at first by the responses he got for Idle Chatter. Nobody seemed to hear the same things [] there has to be a different kind of relation between the material and the way in which people engage it."'

S" The voice in Steve Reich's early tape work Come out (1966) was Donald Hamm, one of the six boys arrested in the 1964 Harlem riots. Reich composed the piece as part of a Town Hall benefit to gain a retrial for those boys involved. The composer had come across a recording of Hamm describing his attempts to get medical attention after being beaten by the police. In the article Listening Subjects: Semiotics, Psychoanalysis, and the Music of John Adams and Steve Reich author David Schwarz details the audio of the youth trying to squeeze his wounds to show blood. Accordingly, the piece begins with a taped voice saying I had to like open the bruise up and let some of the bruise blood come out to show them (0:00-0:005). After a two-second silence (0:05-0:07), the passage is repeated (0:07-0:12); after another two second silence (0:12-0:14), the passage is repeated again (0:14-0:19). For the rest of the piece, the listener moves into the spoken voice, through the repetition and phase manipulation of shorter and shorter phrases and words from the text with which the piece began: come out to show them, to show them, come out. As in It's Gonna Rain, the repetition of come out sounds like a direct address to the listener, an imperative.The inherently musical voice of Donald Hamm, specifically Hamm's distinctive rhythmic/melodic pronunciation of the phrase come out to show them, led Reich to utilize the same phasing process as seen in It's Gonna Rain (1965). Like It's Gonna Rain, Come Out begins with a loop of the phrase as a single channel recorded on a whole reel. Next, the composer records the same loop on channel 2, carefully lining them up to ensure the two channels are in unison. Soon thereafter the composer allows one of the parts to phase forward (or the other to phase backward depending on your point of aural focus). According to the 1971 interview with Michael Nyman, this was achieved by Reich gradually holding the supply reel of the recording machine back with his thumb. Reich states, I was literally slowing it down, but at such an imperceptible rate that you can't hear. At the point where the two-channel relationship 'Come out to show them' has separated into 'come out-come out/ show them-show them', approximately two quavers away by the composer's estimate, he goes on to make a loop from it too. To effectively divide the two channels into four, then finally four into eight 'voices' Reich repeats the phasing process. First, he feeds the current two channel phase into channel 1, again holding it back with his thumb so that it is four quavers away from the original sound and can be heard as a series of equal beats so that it is quite distinct melodically. Next, Reich splices together the two-voice tape with the four-voice tape, then divides it again into eight voices. At this point the voices are, according to Reich, separated it by just a demisemiquaver, so that the whole thing began to shake, then just faded it out and again put those two takes together. So there's absolutely no manipulation of the timbre, no manipulation of the tape.This point of not tampering with the material itself is at the core of Reich's process pieces. In fact, he views these semantically as early speech works, not works of electronic music because they are based entirely on actually vocal sounds, not on electronically produced tones. Also in Music as a Gradual Process: Part I Reich stated:In a nutshell, all the bad things I've had to say about electronic music have to do with electronically generated sounds, have to do with oscillator-based music  I still use electronic organs, but they're always mixed with instruments or voices. I have no such ambiguity about [using] the voice.It is curious that Reich uses the term ambiguity to describe his hesitation, or more succinctly, the lack of hesitation to work with the human voice. Ambiguity becomes a mode of expressiveness with Come Out, but also among other tape and electronic music works with speech/language elements. With such a strong political implication at first, the repetition of phrase progressively degrades its meaning, becoming ambiguous and obscured. David Schwartz writes of this in the article Semiotics, Psychoanalysis, and the Music of John Adams and Steve Reich, saying that Come Out [uses] repetition obsessively to strip meaning just as it is about to take shape. Is Reich, in essence, making Hamm's recorded speech less poignant, more clinical? It could be understood that Hamm's recorded statement, though highly charged with emotion, can only be taken literally, as it entails a first person account of an event. By excerpting the text down to a fragment, Reich is inviting a multitude of interpretations. Listeners can take in the music of Come Out as just that, Absolute Music consisting of harmonic, melodic, and polyrhythmic combinations of a found sound. By using the impersonal technique of phasing, the moment-to-moment relationships resulting here are mostly unforeseen even by the composer. Rather than craft the text-setting to play up its programmatic aspects, Reich merely sets things into motion, in part relinquishing control over the decaying intelligibility of Hamm's message, and by extension the listener's connection with the politicized message."

S' I recently detailed how the human voice is manipulated in Lucier\'s I am sitting in a room in What about the "natural voice" is musical in Schwitters\' Ursonate? How does this compare with the musical characteristics of Lucier\'s I Am Sitting in a Room? The following is an analysis of the voice in Harvey\'s Mortuos Plango, Vivos Voco adapted from a research paper I wrote entitled: Use Your Illusion: An Analysis of Illusionary Compositional Techniques in Jonathan Harvey\'s Mortuos Plango, Vivos Voco and Maryanne Amacher\'s Synaptic IslandTo begin, it is important to understand how the concept for the work was derived from the Latin inscription on the great tenor bell at Winchester Cathedral, England: Horas Avolantes Numero, Mortuos Plango: Vivos ad Preces Voco (I count the fleeing hours, I lament the dead: the living I call to prayer).[1] The above Latin text was sung by the composer\'s son, a young chorister, then the recording was treated to various countrapuntal manipulations. Similar processes were applied to the raw recording of the tolling Winchester tenor bell, creating a plethora of sounds generated only from these two sources. Next, while in residence at IRCAM in Paris, Harvey mapped the natural sound properties of the chorister and bell. Through the use of IRCAM\'s augmented MUSIC V programing language and with the assistance of Stanley Haynes and Xavier Rodet,[2] Harvey was able to create synthesized digital versions of these two sound sources, as well as structure the large-scale pitch motion throughout the work on their characteristic frequencies. The use of illusion in Mortuos Plango, Vivos Voco stems from how Harvey employs the four sounds (original chorister, original bell, synthesized chorister, synthesized bell) throughout the work. Save for a few brief instances during the onset of the composition, these sounds are never fully stated in their basic (prime) form. Rather, the four sounds can be thought of as quadrants on a plane, whereby the musical gestures are represented by the lines between the sectors. From a listener\'s standpoint, the gradients from one sound to another are manifested in complex timbral transformations. It is the mid-points of these transformations force one to question  What is real? What is fake? and How is ambiguity achieved?Harvey carefully weaves the real, normal, and familiar original bell tone and voice sample with the fake, novel and unfamiliar synthetic guises of microtonal sine-tone glissandi connecting the bell transpositions, the reordered splicing of source material, and the mathematically generated static drones. The infinite gradients of perception between sound sources and synthesis was made possible due to the acoustic modeling of pitches, which revolutionized how electronic music could be created henceforth. As a representative example of working in such a fragile perceptual space, contributor Michael Clarke outlines composer Hans Tutschku\'s investigation of the transition between the first and section section in Analytical Methods of Electroacoustic Music, stating:There are three stages to the transformation. First, there is the original vocal sound Pre. This vocal sound cross-fades with sine waves on the most significant frequencies of the vocal sound. Next, these sine waves glissando toward the frequencies of selected partials of the bell on C (260 Hz), contracting in overall frequency range. Finally, (overlapping with these glissandi) these is another, expanding set of glissandi with vibrato, leading into the bell strike for Section 3. [The following figure] uses a sonogram to show this transformation in outline, and [the subsequent figure] shows its pitch structure in more detail, using semibreves to represent pivot notes. The move from the recorded Pre to a synthesized imitation enables the sound to be transformed. The synthesized sine waves can glissando independently, each by different amounts, toward the partials of the bell.[3]For the boy\'s voice the real and fake are clearly discernible in their isolated forms through the presence (or lack thereof) of text. The synthesized voice is able to maintain the feel of a human singing through degree of exactitude in sine wave reproduction in overtones. However, it falters in lacking the nuances necessary to physically produce sound in the throat and mouth (inhaling, exhaling, syllabic articulation, etc). For the tenor bell the differentiation is far less straightforward. The envelope of attack of the real bell is often reshaped by Harvey during playback to provide a greater sense of ambiguity. Without this distinctive attack it is unclear from the onset whether what is being played is the bell, a sine tone, or even the entrance of the boy\'s voice. The fake bell in its isolated form still sounds fake, though this judgment is at the threshold of differentiability. As there are less physical characteristics to cue the listener (no breath or text), and the same generation of overtones from the original sound source is exercised, the final verdict for discerning the bell is a I know it when I hear it situation.[4]Perhaps the most immediately palpable and yet mysterious use of illusion stems from the transfiguration of the voice and the loss, or at times fragmentation, of the prescribed text. The clear presentation of the Latin inscription through the opening lyrics sets up a certain expectation given the tradition of boy choristers singing in Anglican liturgical settings. Short texts, such as this one in Mortuos, are typically repeated ad nauseam during a mass or similar setting to showcase the abilities of the choir and composer to generate elaborate contrapuntal tapestries given the modest initial material. Harvey deviates from this practice by the degree of compressing, excerpting, and otherwise mutilating the original recording of the sung passage. Composers of early church music certainly employed similar techniques of augmentation, diminution, inversion, and retrograde to make the most out of their materials, but this was always within the realm of human performance. By removing the restriction of human performance Harvey is able do away with the standard division keeping single sounds from becoming both individual small-scale events and multiple large-scale formal markers. For instance, the recording of the boy\'s voice is utilized in one section as a flurry of incomprehensible burst, sped up and played in reverse as to mimic the sounds of a tiny engine. The text content is lost entirely here. To achieve forward motion Harvey will then employ the polar opposite treatment to the same recorded passage, stretching the voice to such an extreme that the specific articulations which would ordinarily be heard as consonants are now odd, languid impurities in an otherwise pure wave of slow-moving sonorities. Again, the text content is lost entirely, albeit for a completely different reason. Lastly, when the same manipulations are performed on the synthesized version of the voice, already devoid of text content, a full catalog is established where the composer can freely draw upon any of these versions to add to and comment on the original Latin meaning.

S" BackgroundFor 3 Quarter Tone Piano Pieces instructions for tuning are provided in the score preface and read:The quarter-tone relationship between the two pianos may be accomplished by one of two methods. Ives suggests that one piano be tuned a quarter-tone higher than the other. This procedure is not looked upon with favor by piano technicians. They prefer to take one piano down a quarter-tone. If this latter procedure is adopted, the part written to be played by the quarter-tone higher piano should be played by the piano at normal pitch, while the part written for the normal pitch piano should be taken by the piano tuned down a quarter-tone. In the article Ives' Quarter-Tone Impressions, author Howard Boatwright suggests that the composer's sensibilities regarding temperament were likely influenced early on by his father George Ives' quarter-tone machine. This device consisted of twenty-four (or more) violin strings that could be tuned in various ways. The elder Ives used it to pick out quarter-tone melodies and try to get his family to sing them. Later on in an effort to better train the ear to hear quarter-tone melodies, George Ives developed a way to sustain the strings using weights and violin bows, allowing for quarter-tone harmonies. Nevertheless, it is melodic lines available with this non-traditional temperament that stuck with the young Charles Ives. The composer stated in his writings that after the novelty of the quarter-tone machine wore off it was used as a means of punishment  though we got to like some of the tunes which kept close to the usual scale and had quarter-tone notes.What is perhaps even more telling when it comes to what Charles Ives hoped to gain through the use of microtonality is his prediction for the future. In Joseph Yasser's A Theory of Evolving Tonality (1932), the Ives passage reads: In some century to come, when school children will whistle popular tunes in quarter-tones  when the diatonic scale will be as obsolete as the pentatonic is now  then  boarderland experience may be both easily expressed and readily recognized. Again, the horizontal intervallic opportunities are given the primary focus. The function, as expressed by Ives in the term boarderland experience, may lie in the increased expressivity through greater tonal ambiguity. Microtonality, as seen in 3 Quarter Tones Piano Pieces through the 24 EDO (equal divisions of the octave), is understood to be more nuanced than chromaticism due to the availability of smaller melodic gradations. If one were to continue on with Ives' progression of expressivity via smaller divisions of the octave, pentatonic to diatonic to chromatic to quarter-tone, Georg Friedrich Haas' Limited Approximations would represent two notches further along the continuum; as it utilizes 1/6th and 1/12th tones in addition to quarter-tones. In the score preface Haas outlines how the 72 EDO is to be achieved through the piano temperament, stating (translated into English):1st piano +1/6Ton (raised a 1/6th tone)2nd piano +1/12Ton (raised a 1/12th tone)3rd piano Normalstimmung (normal tuning)4th piano -1/12Ton (lowered a 1/12th tone)5th piano -1/6Ton (lowered a 1/6th tone)6th piano -1/4Ton (lowered a quarter-tone)[Image viaDonaueschinger Musiktage entdecken das Streichquartett]The background to Limited Approximations takes a very different focus than Ives had with 3 Quarter Tone Pieces, emphasizing large scale gestures and (as the title implies) the approximation of overtones. Publisher Universal Edition has included statements from the composer regarding the composition on their website. Here Haas remarks that:limited approximations does not tell a story. As with all my compositions, there is also no formal development or traditional formal structure. Contrasting elements alternate with one another  moments of smoothness and friction. Pseudo-glissandi in the pianos arrive unexpectedly at overtone chords. Apparently stable constellations of intervals begin to falter as the twelfth-tones merge.The spectral, telescoping chords of the pianos are taken up by the orchestra, over and over again. In my early works I had to limit myself to a few basic tones, out of respect for what was practically realisable: in vain makes do with only the 12 tones of the traditionally tuned scale. Natures mortes uses only six different overtone chords, of which four are based on tones found in the traditionally tuned system. In limited approximations, thanks to the pianos, the whole world of sound is open to me.In his paper Some Theoretical Attributes of 72-tone Equal Temperament and Their Realization in Georg Friedrich Haas' limited approximations, Will Mason also details the significance of composer Ivan Wyschnegradsky's arc-en-ciel (1956) as a historical precursor in the six piano 72 EDO realm. Mason contextualizes Limited Approximations as, in part, a homage to Wyschnegradsky and mentions Haas' use of Wyschnegradskys method of modulation in quarter-tone pitch space and his idiosyncratic use of a chord of stacked fourths and tritones. Returning to the quotations via Universal Edition, Haas also cites the specific influence of Wyschnegradsky on Limited Approximations: At the end, a quotation from Ivan Vishnegradskys harmonies (against the relics of an overtone chord in the strings)  not with the clarity of his composition arc-en-ciel (I was able to premire this work for 6 pianos tuned in twelfth-tone intervals in 1988) but in the clouding over of twelfth-tone chords gliding gently towards the heavens. Even this approximation is only a limited one.Comparisons Wyschnegradsky may then be the link connecting Ives' 3 Quarter Tone Pieces with Haas' Limited Approximations.In the score preface Ives stated: Of the three short piano pieces that I've composed with the use of quarter-tones, the first and last were originally intended for a quarter-tone piano, two keyboards and for one player. This proposed setup is clear through the music of each of these movements, however, not realized in typical performances; instead defaulting to the two players, two pianos arrangement (which is reflected in the published score with two grand staves). When this statement from the composer is paired with examination of the notation an argument could be made for Ives' conception of the quarter-tone piano, but settling for the sake of practicality. Excerpt from I. Largo. The phrase, though orchestrated across two pianos, would be playable as a solo if one performer had access to both keyboards. Ives, who was reportedly writing 3 Quarter Tone Pieces from 1923-24, may have been composing with such an instrument in mind. According to Boatwright: [The Czech composer, Alois Haba] wrote for a quarter-tone piano brought out by A. Forster in Prague in 1923; it had two keyboards, one tuned a quarter-tone higher than the other, Ives seems to have been familiar with a similar instrument in New York, as he mentions in his article a quarter-tone piano of this type by Dr. Stoehr, Mehlin & Sons. It is unclear whether Ives had any knowledge of Haba or Wyschnegradsky. The microtonally tuned two manual piano was also used later by Wyschnegradsky, however, his earlier quarter-tone piano works (for example Op.5 Quatre fragments from 1918 and Op.10Variations sur la note from 1918-1920) call for two instruments similar to Ives' pieces for the same reason-- compromise for practicality. Image of Alois Haba with a quarter-tone piano [Page on haba-quartett.de]Though the music clearly necessitates six performers, Haas is also approaching the microtonally tuned piano as one meta-instrument, but takes it further to create one resultant voice. Haas builds a feeling of the single mind generating gestures through the efforts of six individuals. Perhaps a more appropriate imagery for his 72 EDO piano temperament would be a multi-manual piano akin to the Haba and Wyschnegradsky examples, only with six keyboards on the solo instrument rather than two. For as much trouble as Ives had with procuring a quarter-tone piano and the related issues in performance practicalities, Haas' troubles would have been even greater for a hypothetical six manual 1/12th tone piano. Nevertheless, his writing points toward singular goals, often relating to overtone harmonies, achieved through microtonal polyphonic imitation applied to the six pianos. On the aforementioned Universal Edition page Haas describes his approach to the piano writing for the last section of Limited Approximations, stating: [...] A microtonal countermovement is composed into the final third of the piece: from the fifth C-G to the neutral second between the E sharp raised by a twelfth-tone and the F lowered by a sixth-tone. Thus 10 different intervals arise, each of which becomes the centre of an overtone chord. [...] Melodies recur again and again, wandering from piano to piano  as tremolo, as individual tones, as overtone chords. [An] interval (for example the fifth C-G) sounds in all octaves  but some of these octaves are expanded by a twelfth of a tone. The ear corrects the chord (or tries to correct it)  looked at horizontally, the intervals oscillate in twelve-tone steps, but stay in the same place after all The fact that Haas conceived Limited Approximations as a work of three parts may be a coincidence when comparing it to Ives' 3 Quarter Tone Pieces. Despite the composer partitioning of the work into sections, the approach to each is unified in, as Mason expresses, [its] ability to move between systems within 72tet: traditional 12-tone equal temperament, 24-tone equal temperament (quarter tones), and the pitches of the harmonic series up to the 12th partial are all subsets of 72tet. The same integration between sections cannot be said about the three Ives pieces. The first two pieces share more in common with the solo piano literature of the 18th and 19th centuries than the 20th and 21st. Ives (again via the score preface) characterizes I. Largo as [...] primarily diatonic, using quarter-tones as passing tones or suspensions and quarter-tone chords as extensions or variants. For II. Allegro Ives is even more dismissive, stating [it] is mostly made of rhythms contrasted or 'split' between the two pianos. From a pure quarter-tone harmonic standpoint it doesn't amount to much.The parallelisms in the final sections of each work are, however, fortuitous. Like many of Ives' compositions the last movement incorporates a chorale. The composer describes the microtonal functionality here as [a] cantus firmus, taken by the upper voice in the coda [...] made of a phrase in quarter-tones going to one in half-tones and ending in whole tones, while the harmonic plan remains throughout on a quarter-tone basis. Though it is not stated if the cantus firmus is original or not, many of his compositions draw upon quotations, in particular hymns (i.e. Three Places in New England). Haas' piano writing at the end of Limited Approximations also functions akin to a chorale, albeit perceptually stretched and intervalically compressed to an extreme. The strongest relationship between these points is the utilization of quotation and the reference of church polyphony. The most disparate aspects lie in the macro treatment of microtonality: spectral techniques without traditional form (Haas) vs. more intuitive quarter-tone treatment of harmonies with traditional form (Ives)."

S' It is true that child prodigies get a lot of publicity, largely overshadowing the late bloomers. Honestly, I had a hard time finding counter examples, in part due to the vagueness of early musical training throughout biographies. Within classical music what is considered a late start is still absurdly young when compared to many other fields of study. As a result, a number of articles listing famous musicians who started late consider age 10 as ancient and impossibly disadvantaged in pursing a career as a world class concert composer or concertizing classical musician. I disagree with this perpetuated belief that after a certain age one will not be able to become a professional musician, but unfortunately this is a self-fulfilling prophesy. After a bit of research into figures who are commonly mentioned as late bloomers through various anecdotes and classroom asides, it turns out that often these individuals still had some formal musical training during their childhood. The anecdotes fail to emphasize this and focus on the point (usually late teens) where the musicians becomes serious about his or her craft and seeks highly rigorous training. Iannis Xenakis would fall into this category.As for acclaimed composers and instrumentalists who, as far as I can tell, had no dedicated musical study until age 18+ here is one example--Aram Khachaturian (1903  1978)Born and raised in Tbilisi, the multicultural capital of Georgia, Khachaturian moved to Moscow in 1921 following the Sovietization of the Caucasus. Without prior music training, he enrolled in the Gnessin Musical Institute, subsequently studying at the Moscow Conservatory in the class of Nikolai Myaskovsky, among others. His first major work, the Piano Concerto (1936), popularized his name within and outside the Soviet Union. It was followed by the Violin Concerto (1940) and the Cello Concerto (1946). His other significant compositions include the Masquerade Suite (1941), the Anthem of the Armenian SSR (1944), three symphonies (1935, 1943, 1947), and around 25 film scores. Khachaturian is best known for his ballet musicGayane (1942) and Spartacus (1954). His most popular piece, the "Sabre Dance" from Gayane, has been used extensively in popular culture and has been covered by a number of musicians worldwide. His style is "characterized by colorful harmonies, captivating rhythms, virtuosity, improvisations, and sensuous melodies."https://youtu.be/gqg3l3r_DRI'

S' YouthGrowing up my younger brother was clearly the bookworm of the family. We would come back from the public library and he would have a stack of fresh literary sustenance several feet high. I did not understand why he spent all day reading book after book; there were times I remember exclaiming-- "He reads stuff he doesn\'t even like!" This was not an exaggeration; often within the first few pages it was clear if the novel matched his preferences, but if it failed he would continue to power through. Later I understood, it was not about whether he connected with what he was reading. Rather, he liked the act of reading. He was (and still is) a consumer of the written word.The preferred "literature" of my childhood was always about sports cars and rock music. One book, Guitar World Presents the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time!, sticks out in particular. The sections ranking the guitar players was fine, but what kept me up at night was the list of guitar solos. I took this as scripture. It never phased me that the list was simply the result of a reader\'s poll. This was a challenge. From the ages of 14-17 I had this text in tow whenever I traveled, reading and re-reading every detail about these guitar solos. Not only did I have the list memorized in order, but I sought out recordings and sheet music for each of these songs, learning how to play a large portion of the solos and riffs myself. Exposing myself to a variety of sub-genres and eras via this publication proved to be formative in my background as a creative person.As evidenced above, I have always had the makings of a specialist. Unfortunately, my early interests rarely fit into the literature classes at school. It felt like the curriculum was made up entirely of novels taking place in rural pre-1900 America. I grew up in a quite rural area myself and lived in a house surrounded by cornfields and soybean fields as far as the eye could see. Needless to say, I was less than enthusiastic about these mandatory books on frontier life. I knew first hand what living out in the country was like and these romanticized depictions not only bored me, but left me with a suspicion that I perhaps hated reading. During English classes I thought, if this is what novels are all about maybe reading is something I don\'t care for. This all changed my senior year in high school through British Literature. Every book required for that class I enjoyed. Themes of humanism and the chasing of intellectual pursuits were common among the works. The settings were frequently urban. I was hooked. From this year George Orwell\'s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Christopher Marlowe\'s Doctor Faustus, Geoffrey Chaucer\'s The Canterbury Tales, and William Shakespeare\'s Macbeth all left a strong impression on me. It was also during this year that I realized my preference for absurdest humor. I read a lot by and about Douglas Adams, as well as the history of Monty Python. Furthermore, around the same period I was studying for the SAT\'s I remember connecting with A. J. Jacobs\' memoir The Know-It-All.College (undergrad and master\'s years) My freshmen year in college I had enrolled in two comparative literature courses. The topics seemed to be based around various novels from across the world (all translated to English). I appreciated the analytical and critical aspects of pinning these texts against each other. Also during this time I dove into Dante Alighieri\'s Divine Comedy (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow trans.) and John Henry Newman\'s The Idea of a University. Soon after, my focus firmly settled on composition, and because I felt my peers already had such a strong background in classical music (many had attended high school programs like Juilliard Pre-College and the New England Conservatory Prep School), I immersed myself in the subject.Memoirs from major contemporary composers like Gunther Schuller\'s The Compleat Conductor and John Adams\' Hallelujah Junction: Composing an American Life both helped inform what the history of my profession was like in America. As I progressed in my craft my interest in more technical publications began to take over my reading list, both out of necessity and a pure love for the material. These included The Collected Essays of Milton Babbitt, Olivier Messiaen\'s The Technique of my Musical Language, and Erno Lendvai\'s Bela Bartok: An Analysis of His Music.During my final year in undergrad I received a commission to write an art song for a music festival. I took this as an opportunity to delve deeper into modern poetry. I felt strongly about using text from a contemporary writer, as I would hope those in other art forms would feel strongly about using music from a contemporary composer. Thus, I poured over hundreds of short works in various collections and anthologies. I eventually settled on Mark Strand\'s piece Eating Poetry. Much like the realization that I favor absurdity in humor as a high school senior, through this quest for a text I realized as a college senior that I favor surrealism in poetry.While at Oxford for my master\'s I focused deeper into modernism. The most helpful and engaging publications I encountered were Marguerite Boland and John Link\'s Elliott Carter Studies, and Iannis Xenakis\' Formalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in Composition, and David Metzer\'s Musical Modernism at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century. In particular, Metzer\'s book was pivotal in my understanding and contextualization of artistic expression in today\'s world. Today I am starting to be in the odd, yet fortuitous position where I know either the subject or the author (or both) that I happen to be reading. I had the great privilege of studying with Aaron Einbond, and recently he, along with Aaron Cassidy, published Noise in and as Music. I view this book as the next step after Metzer\'s work on modernism. Einbond notes that-- Its contributors are first and foremost practitioners, which inevitably turns attention toward how and why noise is made and its potential role in listening and perceiving.Lastly, about a year ago I was completing an artist residency at the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts (VCCA). As with most artist residencies, the fellows are given a room and private studio to work on their respective project. During mealtimes everyone comes together at the dining room and socializes. At VCCA there is also a tradition of weekly readings, performances, and gallery showings by the current fellows after dinner on a given evening. This is a great, low-key opportunity for everyone to share a bit about their discipline among such a multidisciplinary group. The evening presentations throughout my time there were always a highlight; not only because of the high level each artist was working at, but also because it allowed me to see a different side of an individual that had perhaps remained hidden through the friendly discourse and daily small talk. One of the fellows whose residency overlapped with mine was Sharon Charde, and over the few weeks we were both at VCCA we chatted quite a bit. Our conversations were different from those I would have at other institutes and festivals with composers. After a day or so with a composer I would have a clear idea about how their music would sound and how they relate to their art form before even seeing a score or hearing a recording/performance. With Sharon we spoke about PBS programs, about interpersonal relationships, about graduate school (I was probably a bundle of nerves waiting to hear back after my Stanford interview), and so on. Toward the end of my stay, Sharon mentioned that she was going to present excerpts from one of her books after dinner. I was excited to hear her readings, but honestly was not predicting what it would be like based on getting to know her.That evening I was floored. Sharon\'s selections from Branch in His Hand were so intense, so wrought with beauty and sadness that I did not know how to respond to what I was hearing. Underneath the family therapist, the mother, the wife, the friend, was someone with a profound ability to express loss.'

S" Depending on the piece, indeterminacy and improvisation can be the same thing, however are not always. To clarify it is necessary to look at how these terms are typically defined. According to the indeterminate music entry in The Oxford Companion to Music, [...] the composer has to some degree relinquished control, perhaps by leaving some aspects to chance or to the performer's decision. All music falls within this definition, since musical notation, however detailed, can never prescribe a performance with complete precision; but the term is normally reserved for cases of a conscious abstention from creative choice. The entry goes on to describe various forms of indeterminacy. Several definitions make comparisons with aleatory, but specially the principle by which a decision of the performer of a composition replaces a decision of the composer. Aleatory seems to be a shared component between the two concepts, appearing as one of the Grove Music Online's definitions of improvisation: Aleatory or indeterminate features of modern works are of an improvisatory nature. Within the same entry, improvisation is also stated to be [any] performance according to the inventive whim of the moment, i.e. without a written or printed score, and not from memory. This point of extemporaneousness, without preparation is one of the key distinctions often drawn between works of improvisation and others of indeterminacy. Returning to The Oxford Companion to Music, the improvisation entry further emphasizes this detail:The implication is that improvisation is the freest kind of creative activity, in which spontaneity and lack of forethought displace the long and often tortuous processes which compositional acts are traditionally assumed to involve, as well as displacing the painstaking learning and processing of a printed text which performance normally presumes.Here are some situations to illustrate cases of difference between the two terms before examining the Coleman, Lewis, Zorn, and Riley works. It \tis considered strictly indeterminate music if the composer \trelinquished creative control to a process of composition, though \tstill fully notating the results, and the performer is not given any \tspecial indication regarding interpretation. The \tOxford Companion to Music's \tindeterminate music entry focuses on techniques used by John \tCage, such as determining compositional choices by tossing coins, or \tby placing notes on physical imperfections in the manuscript paper, \tby tracing musical patterns from star maps, and so on. During a \tperformance there are no extemporaneous compositional decisions \tbeing made by the musician, and thus, no improvisation takes place.Another \tcase for strict indeterminacy would be if the composer relinquished \tcreative control over an parameter of the music to the performer, \tbut the performer makes a decision about the choice before playing \t(i.e. not extemporaneously). The examples of this The \tOxford Companion to Music\tprovides include the works of Lutosawski and Henze where certain \tpassages may have the performer repeat a fragment an indefinite \tnumber of times or choose a rhythm for a given set of pitches. \tAnother option is where composers present fixed material which may \tbe played in alternative sequences. For instance, in the Third \tPiano Sonata\t(19557) Boulez allows the player to decide the order of \tmovements, and of fragments within them, to omit certain passages, \tto choose between alternative tempos and dynamics, and so on.[Image via Ornette Coleman - Free Jazz]Free Jazz (1960)  Ornette ColemanIn the article Pitch-Class Transformation in Free Jazz author Steven Block traces the musical sub-genre of free jazz back to this landmark album of the same title. He goes on to call this a realization of Coleman's ideas about freedom in music to their fullest extent. Likewise, Jari Perkimki, in his thesis Lennie and Ornette: Searching for Freedom in Improvisation, describes Free Jazz, as one of Coleman's most radical, forceful and occasionally chaotic, in part due to the two pianoless quartets it employed improvising simultaneously. The 36-minute improvisation constituting the album focuses on, as Block puts it, nontonal material without the benefit of a fixed meter or fixed entries of the ensemble. Therefore, the lack of fixed entries could be considered a indeterminate aspect of the piece as a composition. Nevertheless, Free Jazz both as a recording and as a style is primarily concerned with improvisation, particularly improvisation no longer based on chord changes.[Image via Trummerflora Presents Spring Reverb 2007]Voyager  George LewisThe divide between indeterminacy and improvisation becomes quite murky with Voyager, a nonhierarchical, interactive musical environment that privileges improvisation according to the composer. In the article Too Many Notes: Computers, Complexity and Culture in Voyager, Lewis describes the roles of the composer and improviser throughout the work.Voyager (the program) analyzes aspects of an improviser's performance in real time, using that analysis to guide an automatic composing program that generates complex responses to the musicians playing. This implies a certain independence of action, and indeed, the program exhibits generative behavior independent of the human performer. The system is not an instrument, and therefore cannot be controlled by the performer.If you want to hear the program play in a certain way, you figure out how what you want to hear is organized, and you start playing that way yourself. Te result is two parallel streams of music generation that of the computer and that of the human, each informed by the others music-all improvisational, subject-subject model of discourse, rather than stimulus/response. The software that performs on this recording considers at least thirty different musical parameters as it works on accepting input and generating output. Te input information is passed to a number of analytic processes that deposit their outputs into a block of variables that amount to the state of the input at a given moment. Volume, sounding duration, octave, register, interval width, pitches used, volume range, frequency of silence, and articulation are checked and averaged over time.All of this is passed to the music-generating processes. Many of the same parameters found in the input are passed to the output, such as frequency of silence, volume, sounding duration, octave, register, interval width, volume range, and articulation. Other important musical choices are generated internally via random numbers. These processes provide much of the personality of the system, and include melody and harmony, orchestration, ornamentation, pacing, transposition, rhythm, and internal behavior options, such as whether and how to react to input, or how quickly to change parameter and which should be changed. In the absence of all input, all needed parameters are generated using random numbers.[] What the work is about is what improvisation is about: interaction and behavior as carriers for meaning. On this view, notes, timbres, melodies, durations, and the like are not ends in themselves. Embedded in them is a more complex, indirect, powerful signal that we must train ourselves to detect.If hard lines were to be drawn, the role of the composer in creating the Voyager software could be understood as indeterminate music. The composer is intentionally relinquishing some creative decision making, and transferring the role to the computer. In a way, this is a more modern take on generating pre-compositional material than John Cage's chance procedures. The composer is still in control of some parameters, as Lewis is writing the program and knows the possible ways that Voyager could react to input. He is also choosing the orchestral sound libraries, albeit the manner in which they are combined in textures is up to the software. Once a performance begins, the intention of the piece lies in improvisation, particularly the interplay between human and machine. Aspects such as the exact number of musicians, instrumentation, and duration of the piece as a whole are left as indeterminate.[Image via John Zorn Cobra, North Sea Jazz, Rotterdam / NL, 2009]Cobra (1984)  John ZornThe concept behind Cobra is to take the Ornette Coleman style of free improvisation and apply it to a larger ensemble through a game. There is no published score for Cobra. Rather, according to Dylan van der Schyff in the article The Free Improvisation Game: Performing John Zorn's Cobra, the piece is conveyed through a stack of cardboard cue cards with handles taped to the back of them. On the front of the cards are large letters (SX, CT, D, T, E, B, and so on), numbers (1,2,3, I, II, III) and other symbols. Schyff further details the game, stating:We were each given a sheet where the function of each cue card was described. The sheet contained more symbols in the form of hand gestures. We were also given headbands. As Zorn explained how the system of symbols and gestures worked I realized why the piece could not be published in the traditional way. For one thing, there is no proper scorethe piece consists of a set of events cued by symbols on the cards as well as by the catalog of hand gestures on the cue sheet; the content of each event is entirely dictated by the musicians performing it. Furthermore, there is no conductorthe initiation of events is brought about by the ensemble members themselves via the prompter who stands facing the ensemble (back to the audience) with the cue cards on a table in front of him; the ensemble is arranged in a semicircle facing the audience, the prompter and each other. In performance the prompter is bombarded by various cues from the ensemble, with each musician trying to get the prompter to display the symbol he or she wants to initiate the next event. And while it is impossible for the prompter to be completely impartial, it is largely for the musicians to decide which type of cue will provide the most interesting continuation of events.For example, one musician might hold one hand over his mouth while displaying four fingers with the other hand, meaning that he wants the sub crossfade event to take place. If the prompter notices him first the SX card will be displayed to the ensemble and those who are playing fade out while those who are not playing fade in. Another musician, hearing something she likes, might place one hand on her head and hold up one finger with the other hand cueing the prompter to display the 1 card. This card initiates the sound memory 1 event where musicians are to remember what they are playing at that moment and be able to immediately reproduce and repeat it for an extended period the next time the 1 card is displayed. A myriad of other possible events may be cued, such as duo and trio combinations or different types of endings; donning the headband signals that the musician has decided to temporarily do as they pleasea renegade action that may elicit reactionary responses from the ensemble.Like Voyager, where Cobra lies on the indeterminacy/improvisation continuum is hazy. Each of the cue cards is composed, despite the nontraditional text and symbolic notation. The conductor, or rather, 'prompter' is also the composer, therefore the order that the events take is not necessarily random, otherwise it would not be much of a game. Furthermore, the game is rehearsed. The rehearsal process likely solidifies certain musical responses to specific cue cards from each player. During the concert, what an individual performer is player may not be improvised, if he or she had galvanized that response throughout rehearsals. It is, however, nevertheless indeterminate because the order of events is not revealed and the resultant sounds from various orchestrations are constantly changing. Lastly, it could very well contain a great deal of improvisation, as the above article suggests. The 'prompter', though not making any sound, could effectively be improvising. The players have not rehearsed the transitions and exact timings, plus without written parts there is bound to be differences in performance even among those with solidified musical responses to each symbol. Aspects such as the exact number of musicians, instrumentation, and duration of the piece as a whole are left as indeterminate.[Image via 80 Jahre Terry Riley]In C (1964)  Terry Riley The balance between indeterminacy and improvisation with In C is similar to Cobra, only achieved through more traditional means. Unlike Cobra, there is a score, albeit laid out in an open, modular way. There is no conductor per se, however, the the straight 8th note high C's of the pulse for a piano or mallet instrument functions in a similar way to a conductor. Furthermore, the current (2005) edition of the score Riley publishes contains the following instructions:All performers play from the same page of 53 melodic patterns played in sequence. A group of about 35 creates a rich full overlay but interesting performances have been created with many more or many less.Patterns are to be played consecutively, with each performer having the freedom to determine how many times he or she will repeat each pattern before moving to the next. There is no fixed rule as to the number of repetitions a pattern may have, however, since performances normally average between 45 minutes and an hour and a half, it can be assumed that one would repeat each pattern somewhere between 45 seconds and a minute and 1/2 or longer.It is very important that performers listen very carefully to one another and this means to occasionally drop out and listen. As an ensemble, it is desirable to vary dynamics as well as create group crescendos and diminuendos.Each pattern can be played in unison or canonically in any alignment with itself or its neighboring patterns. One of the joys of playing IN C is the interaction of the players in polyrhythmic combinations that spontaneously arise among patterns. Some quite fantastic shapes will arise and disintegrate as the ensemble progresses through the piece.It is important not to hurry from pattern to pattern but to stay on a pattern long enough to interlock with other patterns. As the performance progresses, performers should stay within 2 or 3 patterns of each other. It is important not to race too far ahead or lag too far behind the main patterns sounding.[] The tempo is left to the discretion of the performers. Extremely fast is discouraged. When a performer is not playing, she should be conscious of the larger periodic composite accents that are sounding. When she reenters she must be aware of what affect [sic] the entrance will have on the overall flow.The ensemble should aim to merge into a unison at least once, but preferable [sic] often during the course of a performance. If all patterns seemed to be played too much in unison a player should try to offset his pattern by and [sic] 1/8th note or other value so as to create a feeling of shifting alignments. It is OK to transpose patterns. Take care when transposing, especially with patterns in running 16th notes. This can create a very muddy sound. Also all instruments should aim at a blend at [sic] no one instrument should stick out except momentarily. Rhythmic augmentation of patterns can be effective.Players may omit patterns that are too difficult or unsuitable for their instrument.Amplification of instruments is allowed to help achieve a balanced dynamics Electronic instruments are also welcome.This is more indeterminate than improvisation. The parameters of extemporaneousness include dynamics, octave, individual tempo, and repetition to say within 2-3 modules of the group. However, a number of these parameters are limited naturally due to each instrument's capabilities. The indeterminate parameters are plentiful. The composer relinquishes the above listing (dynamics, tempo, instrumentation, duration, repetition); yet retains pitch, order of events, and rhythms. What separates In C from the other works is the sense of group improvisation towards a common goal. Cobra is made up of a group of improvisers, but each player has his or her own vested interests. In C is more about working together to create a tapestry rather than competing against each other in a game."

S' In order to analyze different uses of timbral saturation between various works it is necessary to understand the term itself. The concept of timbral saturation could be compared to chromatic saturation. The dodecaphonic works in the early-middle 20th century relied heavily on the saturation of the octave both compositionally and aesthetically, ensuring the appearance of all twelve pitch-classes within a segment of music. This idea of utilizing all available pitches at the same is analogous to the treatment of timbre. In the article Raphal Cendo, Registre des lumires, author Nathan Cornelius outlines saturation (seen in Cendo\'s works) as-- [] overloading the sonic environment so that unforeseen qualities emerge in it, like overloading a microphone with a signal so strong that it generates distortion or feedback. This process can take many forms, such as dense unsynchronized textures, radical extended techniques, or the buildup of contrasting timbres (tone colors).Timbral saturation is then described as-- [] stretching listeners ability to perceive many diverse sound qualities at once. At any given moment, ones attention might rapidly be shifting from the violinists playing col legno, to the pianist hammering on the strings with felt beaters, to the trombonist playing multiphonics with a double reed, to the choir stage-whispering into their microphones.This contextualizing of timbral saturation works well, as exemplified with the Cendo piece, when applied to chamber ensembles or larger groups. However, the Lachenmann, Hendrix, and Romitelli pieces are all focusing on the soloist. Nevertheless, the same principles will be examined; focusing on the sections where the instrumental tone is overloaded and unstable, simultaneously containing many different timbres or rapidly shifting between timbres. Most often this is realized in heavy distortion and, in the case of acoustic instruments, extreme pressure applied to a gesture to effectively distort the tone.Pression (1969)  Helmut LachenmannGiven the above definition, I am reluctant to believe that any of Pression qualifies as true timbral saturation. During the points of overpressure with the bow, the pitch content is not drown out by noise. Furthermore, there is a stability and consistency within the technique of overpressure. For every instance the same ratio of string pitch and scratch tone sound is achieved. There are sections highlighting a greater level of sonic ambiguity, however these (again) do not aim to encompass many different timbres concurrently or rapidly shift between timbres per gesture. Pression is a tour de force regarding all sorts of sounds possible on the instrument, though each timbre is approached in a manner to create a discrete, repeatable identity instead of a combine, opaque resultant. The points of indefinite or indeterminate pitch are also not saturated with sound, but rather characterized by thin, hollow, and airy textures from specific bowing (traditionally or otherwise) of the cello body and bridge. Lachenmann has written on this topic for Pression, stating:In the case of the beautiful, professional cello tone, the relationship of action and result is  as with all sounds considered beautiful in our society  particularly obscured regarding effort and resistance, whereas with the extreme pressure of the fingertips sliding along the wood of the bow the relationship is much more complicated: an almost inaudible result speaks, as it were, of a maximum effort.Helmut Lachenmann, Einfhrungstext zu Pression in Musik als existentielle Erfahrung, p. 381.[Image via Page on youtube.com]Star Spangled Banner (Woodstock 1969)  Jimi Hendrix (arr.)This inclusion in the conversation about timbral saturation among soloists is unique in a number of ways. First, the soloist is performing within the context of a band of musicians, rather than alone onstage. In terms of how extreme sonic textures are received by an audience, employing these intense sounds is more accessible when supported (even if only minimally) by other instruments. This is a matter of contextualization, where the audience is perceiving the points of saturation as explorations into new timbres, yet not fully abandoning the rock band archetype. Though the contribution of the rest of the band musically was quite sparse during this Star Spangled Banner performance at Woodstock, without their presence to fulfill the model expected of the situation the audience would have likely felt abandoned by such unorthodox, ungrounded sounds from the soloist. Secondly, the relationship the soloist has with the composition is also unique among the three works here. At its origin, the Star Spangled Banner is not a contemporary piece, in fact it is far from it. The Star Spangled Banner is an example of a contrafactum: new lyrics set to existing music. In this case, the music was initially "The Anacreontic Song", also known as "To Anacreon In Heaven", and functioned as the official song of the Anacreontic Society, an 18th-century gentlemen\'s club of amateur musicians in London. It is fascinating how this Colonial-Era, British drinking song has transformed over the centuries-- with Francis Scott Key penning new lyrics during the Defense of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812, to its later revisions and subsequent publication as a patriotic song, to the song\'s official designation as the U.S. national anthem in 1931, to represent the unbridled freedom sought by the late 1960s counter-culture via this iconic Hendrix rendition. It is clear that the most notable, and subsequently imitated, aspects of Hendrix\'s version of the Star Spangled Banner were not in any way indicated through the notated composition. The aggressive whammy-bar dives, frequent forays into amplifier feedback, and quick chromatic alterations between thick extended chords (foreign to the original song) contribute to the characteristic timbral saturation of this Woodstock performance. Interestingly, this was not the first time Hendrix had performed the Star Spangled Banner--by a long shot. According to Hendrix scholar Joel J. Brattin in an article with Worcester Polytechnic Institute there are nearly 50 live recordings of Hendrix playing the national anthem, 28 made before Woodstock. [Image via Page on youtube.com]Trash TV Trance(2002)  Fausto Romitelli To compare the level of nuance involved in the timbral saturation between the Romitelli and Hendrix pieces is complicated. For Hendrix, the techniques leading to timbral saturation were honed in over many performances, as the work was initially without any native tendencies in this regard. The sections of timbral saturation function not as a harmonious embellishments on the preexisting material, but rather the soloist\'s artistic commentary on the piece itself, virtually re-imagining the work in his own musical language. Trash TV Trance was composed in a world where both Hendrix\'s Star Spangled Banner and Lachenmann\'s Pression had already existed for over 30 years. As a result, Romitelli creates in many ways an amalgamation between these, taking the distorted electric guitar and approaching the instrument in an even more obscure, unorthodox, Lachenmann-like way. The timbral saturation is not achieved with the same sense of spontaneity or fluidity seen in the Hendrix, as Hendrix\'s performance was likely drawing from equal parts prior performances and novel improvisation. Trash TV Trance is fully notated, and though some interpretation is necessary for all written music, soloists for Romitelli\'s piece stick closely to the nuanced indications in order to accurately reproduce the intended effects. Some of these effects (touching the live 1/4 jack from the instrument cable to the metal guitar bridge, scraping the plectrum against the low E and A strings in a circular motion, etc) generate timbral saturation, though they are employed as discrete sounds, each with a repeatable identity. Where this diverges with Lachenmann is Romitelli\'s use of combine techniques. The resultant is far more saturated timbrally, however perhaps less opaque and ambiguous than Lachenmann\'s more detailed gestures. [Image via Page on youtube.com]'

S' In order to determine why something is (or is not) musical, first music must be defined. Unfortunately, there are many definitions for music, often with varying degrees of exclusion or specificity. My preferred definition comes from The Grande dizionario della lingua italiana (ed. S. Battaglia, Turin, 1981) and roughly translates to-- The art of combining sounds and coordinating them in time and space, produced by the medium of voice or instruments and organized in many structures according to pitch level, duration, intensity, and timbre; science of sound subdivided into melody, harmony, and rhythm.[Image via Kinetype Ursonate]For Kurt Schwitters\' monumental work Ursonate (1922-1932) an added level of complexity is brought to any analysis due to the many versions of the \'poem score\' that exist, as well as the many equally valid performed interpretations. Schwitters created the first line in Ursonate from the opening of a poster poem by fellow Dadaist Raoul Hausmann, then expanded it and developed different notations to represent this line. Schwitters repeated the process of reordering novel yet convincing groups of syllables for subsequent lines, maintaining the poster poem score aesthetic. When performed, the result is perceived as an imaginary, nonrepresentational, aurally coherent language. However, is speaking this fictional language a form of music, or is speaking a faux-language strictly limited to communication? Despite the aural coherence, there is no syntactical meaning associated with these utterances. The syllables are moved around and the implied length of each line is selected in pure service of a musical structure, regardless of the content being for a totally verbal work. In the article Text-Sound Art: A Survey (Performing Arts Journal, Vol. 2, No. 2 Autumn, 1977, pp. 64) Moholy-Nagy translates the title of Schwitters\' Ursonate to "primordial sonata," and goes on to describe it as--[...] a poem of thirty-five minutes duration, containing four movements, a prelude, and a cadenza in the fourth movement. The words do not exist; rather they might exist in any language; they have no logical only an emotional context; they affect the ear with their phonetic vibrations like music.Text-Sound Art: A Survey author Richard Kostelanetz also notes that in recent years, both Eberhard Blum, a German flutist of SUNY-Buffalo, and Peter Froehlich of the English Theatre at the University of Ottawa have performed Ursonate; each of them surpassing Schwitters\' own partial recording. So then, if musicians are performing this piece in concerts it must be musical, right? The issue becomes whether it is inherently musical or whether it is translated into music by the performers. Here lies a philosophical debate that extends far beyond this specific instance, and concerns any instruction based art form. Does the essence of the art exist only when being performed? This is a non-issue for improvisational forms of expression, and yet ironically the highly indeterminate score for Ursonate firmly places it in a no-man\'s land of mediums. A strong case could be made to classify it as strictly a poem, a work of performance art, or a musical composition. What may tilt the scales of identification in favor of music is the intent by the composer during the writing process. Returning to The Grande dizionario della lingua italiana definition, there is deliberate and organized combining sounds. These are indeed coordinated in time and space, and produced by the medium of voice. The final part of the definition, structured according to pitch level, duration, intensity, and timbre; science of sound subdivided into melody, harmony, and rhythm, may be seen as an elaboration common in the application of sounds organized in time and space, but should not be understood as a restriction. Therefore, Ursonate is an uncommonly musical work whereby the score lays out the order of events to be produced by the voice, and the typical elements of pitches, rhythms, timbres, etc. are realized live after the fact by each performer independently.[Image via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...]With Alvin Lucier\'s I am sitting in a room (1969) the text spoken by the performer in cleverly explains the musical qualities of the work itself--I am sitting in a room different from the one you are in now. I am recording the sound of my speaking voice and I am going to play it back into the room again and again until the resonant frequencies of the room reinforce themselves so that any semblance of my speech, with perhaps the exception of rhythm, is destroyed. What you will hear, then, are the natural resonant frequencies of the room articulated by speech. I regard this activity not so much as a demonstration of a physical fact, but more as a way to smooth out any irregularities my speech might have.Lucier, Alvin, and Douglas Simon. Chambers. Middletown, Conn: Wesleyan University Press, 1980. Musical score.Also in the preface for I am sitting in a room, Lucier instructs the performer to choose a room the musical qualities of which you would like to evoke. Like the Schwitters piece, Lucier\'s score is void of any typical musical instruction or standardized notation: no rhythms, no meters, no pitches. Similarly, the performer, though often a musician like with Ursonate, does not need to be. The first distinction between the two works is that one could now argue the text for I am sitting in a room is not even structured musically. Performers can, and have on various occasions, disregard the given text and make their own of any length and content. The piece works regardless of the text, albeit taking on a slightly different individual character for each interpretation. What transformed Ursonate into a musical performance was this human interpretation, however, for I am sitting in a room it is the opposite and the most musical qualities are attributed to the non-human electronic transformations. These transformations of speech into more perceivable music parameters are made possible by the physical properties of each acoustical space. Brandon LaBelle outlines the process in his book Background Noise: Perspectives on Sound Art:By replaying the recording of his voice back into a room, rerecording and playing back, repeating the process, the work develops into an accentuation of acoustic space whereby the sound source (voice) loses its original shape through larger conversational interaction in which the voice makes apparent the surrounding architecture through its disembodied reproduction. Over the course of the work\'s process, the original recording dissolves into a long, moving tone, punctuated, as Lucier points out, by rhythm alone  for we can still make out the general impression of the original spoken text: its inflected edges, the moments of pause, and Lucier\'s stutter. What we hear, then, is phenomenal in so far as space is articulated by sound, yet imbued with an uncertain psychological imperative, for as Lucier\'s voice states, the work is a process through which any speech impediment (in this case, his stuttering) may smooth out. It therefore appears that ambiguity is a key component in whether or not something is musical. Schwitters and Lucier approach ambiguity from opposite directions, despite the surface similarities in their text based compositions. For Schwitters ambiguity in syntactic meaning is essential to the construction of the text, and adheres to the first half of the music definition (organizing sounds in time and space). For Lucier ambiguity is achieved little by little in the composition\'s trajectory toward the second half of the music definition (gaining more traditional melody, timbre, harmony, and rhythm through the loss of speech). The room functions as a complex filter, which according to Aden Evens in Sound Ideas: Music, Machines, and Experience, accentuates some bands of energy, dampens others, and alternates the phase (time shift) and the pitch (frequency shift) of any sound caught in its space. Lastly, in the album notes to the 1990 recording I Am Sitting in a Room: For Voice on Tape (Lovely Music) Nicholas Collins emphasizes this point of equating increases in syntactic ambiguity with increasing in musicality, stating:By the end we cannot distinguish where one word ends and another begins; the text is completely unintelligible. What was once a familiar word has become a whistled three-note motif; what was once a simple declarative sentence has become a curiously tonal melodic fragment; what was once a paragraph of unaffected prose has become music. Somehow, somewhere in the course of 40 minutes of mean of what we\'ve been listening to has slipped from the domain of language to that of harmony.'

S' The most fundamental difference I see is the multiplicity of discrete variations on a theme (Bach), versus continuous variation through repetition (Abrahamsen). Before going deeper into a comparison, I will first examine how each composer structured their respective work. The Goldberg Variations represent the most extended single composition for the harpsichord Bach ever wrote. The 30 variations utilize the bass line of the Aria (shown below) as a formal constraint to create different variations on top of. As a set, these contain a plethora of stylistic references, heightening the contrast between each variation. [Please click for full resolution] Beyond the bass line, the relationship between the variations in the set can be understood as an intervallic progression, increasing/ascending with each cycle. The cycles are ternary and consist of the given intervallic canon followed by a genre piece, and arabesque. The cycle goes through nine iterations before the Quodlibet (pastiche, combining the aria with two popular tunes that fit its harmonic structure) breaks the pattern to foreshadow the aria da capo at the end. Musicologist and harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick expounds on this systematic approach to the variations in the preface to the 1938 G. Schirmer edition to the score. As an example, variation 3 is a canon at the unison, variation 6 is a canon at the second, variation 9 is a canon at the third, and so on until variation 27, a canon at the ninth. Kirkpatrick goes on to note that the variations that intervene between the canons are also arranged in a pattern. After each canon are genre pieces of various types, among them three Baroque dances (4, 7, 19); a fughetta (10); a French overture (16); and two ornate arias for the right hand (13, 25). Furthermore, variations located two after each canon (5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, and 29) are what Kirkpatrick calls "arabesques"; they are variations in lively tempo with a great deal of hand-crossing. The moments of greatest profundity, in my experience, during the Goldberg Variations are the unexpected places Bach is able to arrive at later in the composition. After so many creative takes on G major, the G minor arrivals in variations 15, 21, and 25 feel substantial. In particular, Variatio 21. Canone alla Settima with the slow lament bass immediately following the virtuosic two-part toccata of the preceding variation. Bach never composed an opera, but with this impassioned embellishment of the Aria bass line he is perhaps commenting on the prevalence of this convention and its association with, as Purcell described, love in seventeenth-century opera. [Please click for full resolution] The key structural component in Schnee is also the canonic writing, in fact the subtitle is "ten canons for nine instruments." The canons are grouped into pairs (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, etc). Three intermezzi are also interspersed throughout the work, further dividing the hour-long time scale into sections. Unlike the Bach, these canons are not built off of a theme inherent aspect of the original (for instance the bass line). Rather, variation takes place via the addition of new motifs while retaining others in a static role. This creates a thread connecting the different canons and provides a sense of subtle growth from point A to B over a long stretch, then (still unhurried) back to A. Though the similarities between each of the Goldberg Variations are palpable, notably the inescapable G Major and ground bass blueprint, the drama is attained by abrupt stylistic shifts. Far from subtle, this path would be more appropriated simplified as point A to B to C to D  to A\' (the Quodlibet), then all the sudden back to A for the aria da capo.In lieu of genre pieces breaking up the succession of canons, Abrahamsen uses intermezzi. These periods function as drawn out reliefs from the otherwise relentless ostinati, but also serve the practical function of allowing the players to re-tune their instruments microtonally without completely stopping the motion of the piece. It is incorrect, however, to think that without genre pieces Schnee is not as historically referential as the Goldberg Variations.[Image via Discovering recent masterworks: Abrahamsen\'s "Schnee"]The color and orchestration achieved by various instrumental techniques is inextricably linked to other works of the modern era; the jet whistle points back to Assobio a Jato (1950) by Heitor Villa-Lobos, the inside-the-piano muting points backs to The Banshee (1925) by Henry Cowell, and the use of office supplies (rubbing sheets of paper) as percussion points back to various efforts by John Cage and then Mauricio Kagel throughout the latter half of the 20th century. The Goldberg Variations references are integral to how Bach navigates variation form. Whereas, these references of modern techniques in Schnee are unrelated to the way variation form is employed, and can be heard as the language of the work instead of a structurally significant component. [Image via Discovering recent masterworks: Abrahamsen\'s "Schnee"]Lastly, due to the difference in instrumentation between these two works the way that drama is built through variation form is different. The solo keyboard (or harpsichord) player can only maintain so many independent lines at one time, a characteristic tested to the limits in some of the canons. With nine instruments Schnee progresses less by intervallic identity (as in Goldberg Variations) and more by total saturation or density of texture. Canon 1a is sparse and transparent in individual lines, and while some of the momentum is carried over to subsequent canons, more active layers are added, effectively expanding on the core pulse. The result is oddly a more linear development in the variations of Schnee than the complex relationships constituting a development throughout the Goldberg Variations.'

S' W.A. MozartBy Hermann Abert; translated by Stewart Spencer; edited by Cliff EisenDuring my sophomore year in college I took an honors class entitled "Mozart and His Era." The required reading before each lecture was always from Abert\'s W.A. Mozart, a massive tome clocking in at 1,544 pages. Stephen Pritchard of the Guardian calls this a "a million-word monument" and after finishing it over the span of the semester I attest that it is thorough in a way unlike any other biography I have encountered. German musicologist Hermann Abert first published this obsessive book (a magnum opus in its own right) as three volumes in 1923-24. 80 years later translator Stewart Spencer and editor Professor Cliff Eisen have completed the staggering task of creating an English version as one single edition; adding 200,000 words of footnotes and annotations, as well as taking into account the decades of Mozart scholarship since Abert\'s work first appeared.The publisher, Yale University Press, describes the biography as:Hermann Abert\'s classic biography, first published in German more than eighty years ago and itself based on the definitive mid-nineteenth century study by Otto Jahn, remains the most informed and substantial biography of Mozart in any language. The book is both the fullest account of the composers life and a deeply skilled analysis of his music.Proceeding chronologically from 1756 to 1791, the book interrogates every aspect of Mozarts life, influences, and experience; his personality; his religious and secular dimensions; and the social context of the time. In a book within a book, Abert also provides close scrutiny of the music, including the operas, orchestral work, symphonies and piano concertos, church music and cantatas, and compositions for solo instruments.'

S" I touched upon this briefly in Have composers other than Ligeti used micropolyphony?What separated Ligeti and his micropolyphony technique from his contemporaries was the means of achieving the pitch clusters. Penderecki produces his extensive elaborations on tone clusters by aleatoric means, often involving a multitude of glissandi effects with indeterminate repetitions of attacks and entrances.To examine this comparison closer I will be using Ligeti's Lux Aeterna (1966) for 16 solo singers and Penderecki's Threnody (1960) for 52 string instruments as examples. The Ligeti Requiem is a fantastic micropolyphonic piece. However, with an instrumentation consisting of 3 flutes, 2 piccolos, 3 oboes, 1 English horn, 3 clarinets, 1 bass clarinet, 1 contrabass clarinet, 1 E-flat clarinet, 2 bassoons, 1 contrabassoon, 5 French horns, 3 trumpets, 1 bass trumpet, 1 trombone, 1 bass trombone, 1 contrabass trombone, 1 tuba, percussion (glockenspiel, xylophone, snare drum, bass drum, suspended cymbal, tamtam, slapstick, tambourine), 1 celesta, 1 harpsichord, 1 harp, 26 violins, 12 violas, 10 cellos, 8 double basses, chorus, soprano soloist, and mezzo-soprano soloist it can be difficult to see exactly what is going on form-wise. In particular, the visual switch between examining an individual line (often each performer on a separate staff in the score) and examining the resulting full texture can be tricky. Terminology: At the most basic level there are different terms used to describe the pitch clustering in Ligeti's and Penderecki's large-scale works of the 1960s. Ligeti coined the term micropolyphony when discussing the processes of his music, and the term, as well as the technique, has become inextricably linked to him. The impact of this technique (polyphonic writing applied to a vast number of individual instruments or voices) in modern music is substantial. Works drawing upon similar means after 1960 are immediately thought as Ligetian in nature regardless of the influence. Works of earlier eras are even now being contextualized as proto-Ligetian micropolyphony. Sound mass is a more vague term, as it describes the resulting texture and not the specific technique required to produce it. Therefore, sound mass is not tied to any one composer the same way that micropolyphony is. Sound mass has been used to describe sections of a number of works by Ligeti, Penderecki, Xenakis, Lutosawski, Ives, Stockhausen, Crumb, as well as others. Another way of thinking about it is that micropolyphonic compositions will likely result in a sound mass texture, but not all sound mass textures require micropolyphonic compositional techniques.Functionality in Lux Aeterna: In the opening of the piece Ligeti constructs a cantus firmus in measures 1-24 using the pitch F as the central note of the trichord E-flat, F, and A-flat (or {0,2,5} for those of you who deal in Babbitt-style pitch classes). From measure 8 to measure 24, the trichord is always present regardless of other activity. In the essay Unlocking the Mystery in Ligeti's Lux Aeterna author Jeremiah Selvey notes the various transpositions of the {0,2,5} chord or Ligeti chord as a key feature in understanding the structure. The temporal component of micropolyphony, as seen in the opening, is achieved through a massive polyrhythmic canon. Here each voice is assigned a rhythmic denominator as to deny unison attacks between parts. For instance, the basic building block of soprano 1 is tuplet 16th notes, soprano 2 is quintuplet 16th notes, soprano 3 is straight-16th notes, and so on. Through the use of these differing localized polyrhythms Ligeti is able to ensure this sound mass effect. No unifying meter is palpable, nor is any individual's contrapuntal motion susceptible to isolated listening during the tutti sections. Though often compared to the great polyphonic works of the Renaissance, the rigorous application of pre-compositional rules is perceived by listeners in a fundamentally different way. The melodic lines governed by strict procedures in Ockeghem, Palestrina, and the like are done so in order to arrive at an optimal texture where all voices may be aurally identified by their role. As more and more voices are given independent lines (especially with the highly chromatic vertical sonorities) there is a tipping point where, as Ligeti puts it: The polyphonic structure does not come through, you cannot hear it; it remains hidden in a microscopic, underwater world, to us inaudible.Functionality in Threnody: Taking a look at the score, the opening for Threnody does not reveal a metrically strict texture made up of fully notated rhythms. Rather, Penderecki is able to achieve similar saturated pitch clusters through the differences in musical interpretation within a large group. The lack of temporal precision inherent in the time-line notation, coupled with the indeterminate pitch (as high as possible) creates performed complexity far exceeding what can be seen on the page. Perhaps the best way to contextualize the differences in compositional approach is top down (Penderecki) vs. bottom up (Ligeti). Penderecki deconstructs what is required to create sound masses. In the case of Threnody, these textures could be arrived at from painstakingly notated individual parts, but in the end his practice begs the question: What is the point of nuanced individual lines when (as Ligeti points out) the particularities of the polyphonic structure become inaudible? Why compose for the individual (micro) when you can more directly achieve arguably the same ensemble sound (macro)?The often exacting rhythms and difficult harmonies practically invite slip-ups within even the most seasoned groups performing Lux Aeterna. The paradoxical part is that these small inaccuracies that accompany live performance make little to no difference in the perceived effect of the sound masses due to the density and chromatic saturation of the texture. Perfect, machine-like intonation would be no better (and perhaps, ironically, much worse) at creating the desired effect. Penderecki takes this to the next logical place and essentially composes the human differences of interpretation and performance practice in Threnody. Without being told exactly when to re-articulate the bow, or exactly what pitch to play, and without the familiar structure of measures/meters; natural microscopic differences in playing and improvisation contribute to the same saturation for Threnody that is heard in Lux Aeterna.The differentiation between these two compositional methodologies is therefore beyond labels and the aesthetics of notation, it is a matter of decision making. For Ligeti's micropolyphony the composer carefully instructs each performer on the changing musical parameters at any given time. For Penderecki's sound masses the composer provides a loose shape and the performers make their own decisions (to an extent) to achieve the shape."

S' At institutions with the most funding the average matriculation age is usually around 29 years old. The ages when entering such a program frequently span from 25 to 35, with those outside of this range in either direction extremely rare. I know this might come as a shock to many in the STEM fields where typical incoming Ph.D. students are fresh out of undergrad. However, for small programs like Stanford and Harvard the intake is only 2-3 new doctoral composers per year. With such a limited number of spots, competitive applications must demonstrate substantial training in the field and high promise of attainment as composers. "Substantial training" often means already having earned a master\'s degree in composition, participated in international music festivals, garnered professional commissions, and premiers with top ensembles/soloists. All of these components take time and are difficult to attain at any age, especially for young composers still searching for their voice. Those beginning a doctoral program at a larger school of music or at an institution with stand-alone master\'s programs are often younger. 24-25 years old is quite normal here because these schools commonly accept students from their own master\'s program into their doctoral program upon graduation.[Image via Elliott Carter at 99]'

S" [Image via The creativity of 'karma']A lot of folks working on music technology products give guest lectures at CCRMA (Stanford). Some of the faculty, researchers, and graduate students would be considered early adopters. Similarly, depending on the topic, there could be interest among this group. I would try to give presentations at all of the major music technology organizations (see What music organizations are most technologically advanced?). There is a potential here to make connections and gain valuable feedback on your product. Additionally, it might be a good idea to get a booth at the NAMM Show and Maker Faire.Lastly, if you have research interests, there is the technology conference route."

S' [Please click for full resolution-- Image via 7. Orchestral Idioms and Mass Effects after World War II]Micropolyphony was coined by composer Gyrgy Ligeti in the early 1960s to describe the application of canonic structures to large numbers of individual instrumental or vocal lines. A prime example would be his 1961 orchestral work Atmospheres, whereby a 48 part mirror canon is constructed with separate parts for each of the fourteen first violins, fourteen second violins, ten violas, and ten cellos. The effect is, according to Ligeti, that--[...]you cannot actually hear the polyphony, the canon. You hear a kind of impenetrable texture, something like a very densely woven cobweb. I have retained melodic lines in the process of composition, they are governed by rules as strict as Palestrina\'s or those of the Flemish school, but the rules of this polyphony are worked out by me. The polyphonic structure does not come through, you cannot hear it; it remains hidden in a microscopic, underwater world, to us inaudible. I call it micropolyphony (such a beautiful word!). (Bernard)Around the same time period other composers were experimenting with dense textures resulting from many independent instrumental or vocal lines. These included, most notably, Krzysztof Penderecki (ex. Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima) and Iannis Xenakis (ex. Pithoprakta). What separated Ligeti and his micropolyphony technique from his contemporaries was the means of achieving the pitch clusters. Penderecki produces his extensive elaborations on tone clusters by aleatoric means, often involving a multitude of glissandi effects with indeterminate repetitions of attacks and entrances. Xenakis achieves his sound-cloud textures through mathematical structures and probabilities, taking data derived from such equations to determine starting and ending pitches/attack times/durations, then transcribing them to music paper.Though the term "micropolyphony" is strongly tired to Ligeti, there are composers with earlier works utilizing similar means, as well as several composers afterwards who were directly influenced by Ligeti. To collect recommendations of specific individuals who have written micropolyphonic pieces I conducted a cursory search through the Oxford Music Online and JSTOR databases. Luis de Freitas Branco (1890-1955)  [Vathek] is remarkable particularly for its third variation: a fugato for strings in 59 parts that foreshadows Ligetian \'micropolyphony\'. (Moody)Paul Dessau (1894-1979)  [Musik fr 15 Streichinstrumente\'s] exposition and recapitulation both comprise four clearly defined tutti sections which embrace writing of stark contrasts, from sprung rhythms reminiscent of early Tippett to Ligetian micropolyphony. (Hinton) Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975)  The Symphonic Dedication to October  later designated the Second Symphony  is a single-movement oratorio-symphony. The work is notorious for its miasmic opening, with layered polyrhythms prophetic of 1960s Ligetian micropolyphony, and for a passage of manic 13-part free-association counterpoint as anarchic as anything in Schnittke. (Fanning)Clytus Gottwald (1925- )  Ligeti\'s pools of sound, for example, influenced Gottwald\'s transcription of Soupir by Maurice Ravel, and Ligeti\'s micropolyphony is the primary feature of the transcription of Berg\'s Die Nachtigall. (Bloesch) Friedrich Cerha (1926- )  [Baal is] a slick 1920s foxtrot rubs shoulder with micropolyphony and aleatoric procedures, and there is even an allusion to Messiaen\'s ornithological music. (Clayton) Alfred Schnittke (1934-1998)  The brief, wordless Voices of Nature (1972), for ten women\'s voices and vibraphone (deployed in an eleven-part canon), is closer to the Schnittke we know in its use of Ligetian micropolyphony to produce dense and dissonant clusters. (Anderson) Sndor Balassa (1935- )  Finally, the contrast between rangy expressionist vocal melody and a dense micopolyphony in which isolable melody plays little part obviously suggests Ligeti, though Ligeti himself had not clearly adopted this technique when Balassa composed his Requiem in 1968-69. (Walsh)Erkki Salmenhaara (1941-2002)  On meeting Ligeti in 1962 [Salmenhaara] began to study his music and launched the concept of Tonfeld in Finland, which in Ligetis music covers both static timbres and micropolyphony, i.e. textures in which details are subordinated to the whole as statistical elements (permeability). (Heinio)Vahram Ohani Babaian (1948- )  [Babaian] makes use of impressionist and sonoristic techniques (the ballet Pygmalion), heterophony and micropolyphony (Fifth Symphony) and dense textures involving chords and clusters. (Sarkisyan)Akira Nishimura (1953- )  Nishimura principally employs heterophony, a characteristic device of Asian traditional music, thereby subtly transforming the intervals, rhythm and melody of his dense multi-layered textures. Though similar to the micropolyphony of Ligeti, an Asian perspective informs his technique. (Narazaki)Erkki-Sven Tr (1959- )  When the solo lines [of regilaul] play against the larger instrumental body, it is often in the complex textures of Ligetian micropolyphony. (Anderson)'

S' [Image via Composers :: Philharmonia Orchestra]The term "follow" caries an implication that the composers are currently still active. For example, you might follow a composer\'s works by attending the premiers or searching for the latest recordings. Neo-classicism within Western music history is often contextualized as a trend arising in the 1920s where composers displayed a renewed interest in the formal clarity characteristic of the 17th-18th centuries. This was often a reaction against the "excessive" orchestration of the late 19thcentury Romantics. Though I am sure there are still many significant composers today who are concerned with utilizing clarity of form, their aesthetic choices are far less referential to classical genres. As a contrast, the most notable neo-classical composers made direct reference to 17th-18th century forms and figures. For instance, Sergei Prokofiev\'s Symphony No. 1 in D major (Op. 25) "Classical Symphony" of 1917 is written in loose imitation of the style of Haydn (and to a lesser extent, Mozart). Igor Stravinsky\'s ballet Pulcinella of 1920, typically regarded as the textbook example of neo-classicism, is a commentary on the commedia dell\'arte libretto and music composed by Giovanni Pergolesi. Though the popularity of neo-classicism peaked in the 1920s, its precursors and influence extends several decades in either direction. I am still unaware of any contemporary composers today who would self-identify as strict neo-classicists, however, a handful have certainly dabbled in this tradition for past works. To collect recommendations of specific individuals who have written neo-classical pieces I conducted a cursory search through the Oxford Music Online database. Below are figures and key works to look into, ordered chronologically from most recent.Michael Torke (1961)  He continued his exploration of 19th-century genres with the piano concerto Bronze (1990), of which he gave the premire[...] (Chute)Paul Moravec (1957- )  A prolific composer, he combines a respect for and mastery of traditional formal and harmonic structures with a driving individuality; his style can best be described as a fluent, idiomatic, but unusually intense neo-classicism. (Page)John Harbison (1938- )  The works from his earliest period show the dual influences of serialism and Stravinskian neo-classicism. (St George)Henryk Grecki (1933-2010)  He revealed the extremes of his musical temperament in the savaged neo-classicism of the Sonata for Two Violins (1957), which contains potent dynamic and rhythmic contrasts as well as displaying a taste for the grotesque that would resurface over 30 years later. (Thomas)Martin Boykan (1931- )  Boykan\'s mature style is atonal and reflects the influences of Webern and the late music of Stravinsky, the respective subjects of his two most important articles (Neoclassicism and the late Stravinsky, PNM, i/2, 1963, p.155, and The Webern Concerto Revisited, Proceedings of the American Society of University Composers, iii, 1970, p.74). (Gilbert)Jacob Druckman (1928-1996)  Druckmans earliest published works, such as Divertimento (1950), tend towards neo-classicism. (Clarkson)Ben Johnston (1926- )  Johnstons reputation has rested primarily on his work in microtonality. However, his earlier music was in equal temperament, with a tendency towards neo-classicism (Septet, the early piano pieces)[...] (Kassel)Lukas Foss(1922-2009)  With the more conservative musical taste of the 1980s and 90s, Foss revisited the neo-classicism and Americana of his first period, composing again in traditional instrumental and choral genres, but not forgetting the experimental techniques of his second period. In his American Cantata (1976) he strove to be as crazy as I was in my avant-garde music and yet tonal. His guitar concerto, American Landscapes, combines folk guitar styles and tunes with novel plucking and percussion techniques in the solo part. Similarly, in the wistful and antiquarian Renaissance Concerto, the solo flutes key clicks add percussive effect. (Chase)Leonard Bernstein (1918-1990)  [Choreographer] Robbins included social dances, which Bernstein reflected in the score [West Side Story and Fancy Free] with big band rhythms, some block scoring, and blues inflections, tied together with a Copland-like musical stance and neo-classicism heard in many concert works in the 1940s. (Laird)Arthur Berger (1912-2003)  [...]The diatonic skeleton of his music provided a connection with Stravinskian neo-classicism; indeed, Babbitt used the term diatonic Webern in a review of the Duo for cello and piano (1951) and Berger himself hinted at a merging of the two styles in his work when he described the Chamber Music for 13 players (1956) as neoclassic twelve-tone. (Kaufman)Samuel Barber (1910-1981)  The vein of American neo-classicism that entered his music in the 1940s, in such works as the Piano Sonata (1949), refined his style without changing it fundamentally. (Griffiths)Lennox Berkeley (1903-1989)  The score [Jonah] is permeated with Stravinskian neo-classicism  in some ways it seems to anticipate The Rakes Progress  and its construction in separate numbers derives from the Bach passions and cantatas. (Dickinson)William Walton (1902-1983)  []Faade (19212) [...]won the composer a reputation for wit and iconoclasm and placed him among those British composers (especially Bliss, Lambert, and Berners) who were captivated by elements of popular music and neo-classicism spearheaded by Stravinsky and Les Six. [...]A blend of neo-classicism and neo-romanticism continued in the Sinfonia concertante (19267, rev. 1943)[...] (Griffiths)Aaron Copland (1900-1990)  He then studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris (19214) and, as one of her first American pupils, gained a facility for neo-classicism which he skilfully and brashly combined with jazz in his Piano Concerto (1926). (Griffiths)George Antheil (1900-1959)  [...]He consciously chose to change his compositional style in the Symphonie en fa (19256) and the Piano Concerto (1926), compositions which in 1936 he labelled neo-classic. [...]The Piano Concerto, given its premire on 12 March 1927, was criticized as being a mere imitation of Stravinskys neo-classicism and an abandonment of the earlier iconoclastic mechanistic style. (Whitesitt)Kurt Weill (1900-1950)  His early works, for example the String Quartet (1923), reveal a teasing eclecticism that combines the neo-classicism of Busoni with the near-atonality of Schoenberg[...] (Ashley)Roger Sessions (1896-1985)  His early works, though influenced by Stravinskian neo-classicism, are sober and without irony[...] (Griffiths)Dimitri Mitropoulos (1896-1960)  After his contact with the music of Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, and Bla Bartk in Berlin, Mitropoulos became the first Greek composer who  in his mature works of the years 19248  made use of modern techniques and styles, such as atonality (Passacaglia, Intermezzo e Fuga,14 Invenzioni), the 12-tone method (his Ostinata is one of the earliest 12-tone compositions in European music history), new folklorism (Four Cytherean Dances) and neoclassicism (Concerto grosso). (Fulias)Paul Hindemith (1895-1963)  In the same year he wrote the piano suite 1922, fashionably including shimmy and ragtime movements, and Kammermusik no. 1 for small orchestra, which marked a turning towards neo-classicism. (Griffiths)Sergey Prokofiev (1891-1953)  Prokofiev showed quite another side of himself in the Classical Symphony op.25 (191617). His much-quoted remark  I thought that if Haydn were alive today he would compose just as he did before, but at the same time would include something new in his manner of composition. I wanted to compose such a symphony: a symphony in the classical style  reads like an early confession of neo-classicism. Stravinskys Pulcinella, the key neo-classical work, was not begun until two years later. Prokofiev was certainly referring back to classical models here, for instance in the proportions of the symphony, the well balanced sonata movements in the opening allegro and the finale, the triad-based melodies and the occasional Alberti bass figures. However, the stylization also includes Baroque elements, particularly in the third movement, a gavotte, and in the regular accompanying chords of its predecessor. (Redepenning)Arthur Bliss (1891-1975)  After the war he fell under the spell of Stravinsky and Diaghilev, and his first experimental compositionsMadame Noy (1918), the Rhapsody (1919), and Rout (1920)show an attraction towards neo-classicism. (Griffiths)Heitor VillaLobos (1887-1959)  [Lobos] spent 19234 in Europe and 192730 in Paris where he was influenced by Satie and Milhaud and by fashionable neoclassicism. [The] result was [a] series of works called Bachianas Brasileiras in which Baroque forms were recreated with Brazilian local colour. (VillaLobos, Heitor)Ernest Bloch (1880-1959)  He continued to compose steadily, influenced by neo-classicism in such works as the Concerto Grosso no. 1 (19245) but retaining the melodic warmth that had characterized his earlier Jewish music. (Griffiths)Manuel de Falla (1876-1946)  Other works drawing on Spain\'s musical-historical past include the chamber cantata Psych, set in the court of the 18th-century King Philip V and his consort Isabel Farnese; an introspective yet intense miniature, the work most clearly shows the influence of Debussy. In the spirit of Spanish neo-classicism. [...]If the stylistic label neo-classicist implies an uncomfortably wide range of meanings, it is nonetheless the most accurate description of Falla\'s works of the 1920s. (Hess)Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958)  The Concerto for violin and strings (19245), originally called Concerto accademico, is Vaughan Williamss nearest approach to a Bachian neo-classicism and was probably written in response to Holsts Fugal Concerto. (Ottaway)Erik Satie(1866-1925)  He continued writing piano pieces up to the same year, anticipating Stravinskian neo-classicism in the Sonatine bureaucratique (an adaptation of Clementi\'s Sonatina, op.36 no.1)[...] (Orledge)Carl Nielsen (1865-1931)  One of the most important and free-spirited of the generation of composers who straddle the 19th and 20th centuries, his music covers a wide range of styles, from Brahmsian Romanticism at the outset to a high-principled, personal brand of neo-classicism in his last years. (Fanning)Claude Debussy (1862-1918)  All three sonatas [Cello Sonata (1915), the Sonata for flute, viola, and harp (1915), and the Violin Sonata(1916-1917)] anticipated neo-classicism in their simplicity, clarity, and stylistic restraint.

S' This is certainly dependent on how "intense" is defined when applied to listening. When I think of intense listening experiences they usually contain a lot of: timbral saturation, abrupt interjections, harmonic complexity, and a shockingly visceral affectation. Oftentimes, this is only an excerpt from a work, though may be the most memorable part. Similarly, for me, it is hard for any other era to compete with the 20th-21st centuries when it comes to raw "intense" sonorities. Of course there are emotional, heart-wrenching moments in works throughout hundreds of years constituting the Classical canon. In fact, I have focused on a number of them in a previous answer (What are the most badass classical music compositions?). Nevertheless, for this listing I will stick to a few "modern" interpretations of intensity--Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1960) by Krzysztof Pendereckihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...

S' If someone had never tried beer before and, over the course of a week, I wanted to provide an introduction to the range/variety of offerings available I would pick (in no particular order):American Double / Imperial IPAPliny The Elder - Russian River Brewing Company (California, United States)Image via East meets West Review from BeerAdvocate magazine Vol. III Issue I:[...] Light honey amber in color, topped with a big, fluffy, creamy white head with a ton of glass stickage. Massive ripe pineapple aroma in the nose, with pine, mint, sappy resins, powdery pale malts and a hint of alcohol. Silky smooth, medium bodied, with a very firm consistency and slightly chewy back. Hop presence is artfully chaotic. Nice prickly stab on the palate up front, semisharp bitterness, grassy, zesty grapefruit, deep smacking of ripe pineapple and pine. Juicy fruitiness, notes of apple and pear too. Dry middle with suggestions of chalky aspirin. Bready malts, soft and sweet, provide a nice backboard for the hops. Oily and ashy hop resins stick to the palate and follow through into a dry, bitter linger. Alcohol becomes sentient as the beer warms, speaking to us in tongues. And despite this, remains insanely drinkable.*Alternates: Double Jack - Firestone Walker Brewing Co.; Heady Topper - The AlchemistAbbey Style Quadrupel (Quad) St. Bernardus Abt 12 - Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV (Belgium)Image via Lagringsexperiment: St Bernardus Abt 12 1988 The brewery describes this beer as:[...] Dark with a full, ivory-colored head. It has a fruity aroma, full of complex flavours and excells because of its long bittersweet finish with a hoppy bite. (10,0% ABV) Worldwide seen as one of the best beers in the world. It\'s a very balanced beer, with a full-bodied taste and a perfect equilibrium between malty, bitter and sweet. One of the original recipes from the days of license-brewing for the Trappist monks of Westvleteren.*Alternates: Trappistes Rochefort 10 - Brasserie de Rochefort; Three Philosophers - Brewery OmmegangGerman HefeweizenWeihenstephaner Hefeweissbier - Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan (Germany)The brewery describes this beer as:Our golden-yellow wheat beer, with its fine-poured white foam, smells of cloves and impresses consumers with its refreshing banana flavour. It is full bodied and with a smooth yeast taste. To be enjoyed at any time,goes excellently with fish and seafood, with spicy cheese and especially with the traditional Bavarian veal sausage. Brewed according to our centuries-old brewing tradition on the Weihenstephan hill.*Alternate: Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse - Spaten-Franziskaner-BruRussian Imperial StoutSamuel Smith\'s Imperial Stout - Samuel Smith Old Brewery Tadcaster (England, United Kingdom)Image via Olutarvio: Samuel Smith Imperial Stout The brewery describes this beer as: This distinctive type of beer was originally brewed to withstand the abuses of shipping in foul weather to Imperial Russia. It was a favourite of Russian nobility whose taste for the finest food and drink was world famous.A rich flavourful brew; deep chocolate in colour with a roasted barley nose and flavour that is a complexity of malt, hops, alcohol and yeast. Fermented in stone Yorkshire squares.  *Alternates: Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout - North Coast Brewing Co.; Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout - Great Divide Brewing CompanyCzech PilsenerPiercing Pils - Dogfish Head Brewery (Delaware, United States)Image via Reinventing Lagers The brewery describes this beer as:A Perry-Pils hybrid, Piercing Pils is a Czech Style Pilsner brewed with a White Pear Tea and Pear juice. Both the juice and the tea were added in the kettle during the whirlpool (after the boil) for maximum flavor and aroma contribution. The Pear fruit complexity pierces right through the spicy Czech Saaz hops beautifully, adding a gentle acidity to this pale lager that makes for a crisp refreshing sipper. Amarillo hops add nuanced citrus notes that meld perfectly with the fruit. DoppelbockSamichlaus Classic Bier - Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg (Austria)Image via Eggenberger Samichlaus ClassicDescription:The once strongest beer in the world is back ! Brewed only once a year on December 6. Samichlaus is aged for 10 months before bottling. This beer is perhaps the rarest in the world. Samichlaus may be aged for many years to come. Older vintages become more complex with a creamy warming finish. Serve with hardy robust dishes and desserts, particulary with chocolates, or as an after dinner drink by itself. Brewed under the exclusive licence of Feldschlsschen-Hrlimann-Holding, Switzerland.*Alternate: Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock - Privatbrauerei Franz Inselkammer KG / Brauerei AyingSaison / Farmhouse Ale Saison Dupont - Brasserie Dupont sprl (Belgium) Image via Les Coureurs des Boires: mai 2012 A slightly cloudy yellow-colored ale with high carbonation, fruity and spicy aromas and tastes, and perceptible, somewhat quinine-like bitterness. Brewed in the Saison style from Pilsner malt and Kent Goldings and Styrian Goldings hops. Originally titled "Saison Vielle Provision", the beer was also dry-hopped until the brewery stopped this practice in favor of a larger late hop addition in the boil. Unfiltered and bottle-conditioned, Saison Dupont is packaged in green glass bottles of a thickness appropriate to withstand the substantial carbonation. The bottles are finished with a champagne-style cork and wire cage.Old AleTheakston Old Peculier - T & R Theakston Ltd. (England, United Kingdom)Image via The Br Rev - Theakston Old Peculier The brewery describes this beer as:Old Peculier is a beautiful, yet very simple beer, brewed using a very generous blend of finest pale, crystal and roasted barley with two bitter hops combined with the majestic and noble Fuggle hop to produce a beer of awesome full-bodied flavour with subtle cherry and rich fruit overtones. It tastes superb when accompanied by rich stews, strong cheeses and sweet puddings. TripelLa Fin Du Monde - Unibroue (Quebec, Canada)Image via Unibroue La Fin Du Monde Ale La Fin du Monde (literally French for "The End of the World" as per the translation on the back of each bottle) is a Belgian-style tripel and bottle conditioned golden ale introduced in July 1994. The name is claimed to derive from the European explorers\' belief that they had reached the end of the world when they discovered America.The colour is a cloudy blonde with a golden hue. Though similar to Belgian tripels in appearance, La Fin du Monde is less bitter and more spicy (featuring coriander and orange peel), more similar to Tripel Karmeliet than standard tripels like Chimay and Westmalle. The beer contains a very high (9% ABV) alcohol content.*Alternate: Westmalle Trappist Tripel - Brouwerij WestmalleRye Beer Founders Red\'s Rye IPA - Founders Brewing Company (Michigan, United States)Image via Founders, Red\'s Rye P.A. The brewery describes this beer as:Serious hop bitterness, along with an unyielding grapefruit bouquet from the Amarillo dry hop, balances the malty richness of four varieties of imported Belgian caramel malts. Pours a spectacular crimson with a creamy tan head. A generous addition of rye malt accentuates a spicy, crisp finish.'

S" I mostly agree with Curtis Lindsay's list, and I would like to further emphasize that Milhaud wrote a lot of music. Today however, his music is not performed very much when compared to other figures of his era (at least in the United States). During my undergraduate I took a number of classes with John Heiss, who studied with Milhaud over the summers at Aspen as a young composer. Intrigued by Heiss' anecdotes, I checked out a bunch of recordings of Milhaud's works. To be honest, much of the music I found to be quite bland. Nevertheless, here are some works I found to be his best.La cration du monde (1923), a ballet which outlines the Creation of the World based on African folk mythology, is probably is most famous composition.Sonata for violin & piano No. 2, Op. 40 (1917)String Quartet No. 1, Op. 5 (1912)String Quartets No. 14 and No. 15, Op. 291 (19481949); The 14th and 15th string quartets can be performed separately as well as simultaneously as a string octet.String Quartet No. 3 with solo voice, Op. 32 (1916); poem by Lo Latil"

S' When it is time to really focus on my work I retreat from the outside world and make my desk space a sanctuary. I like Ellen\'s imagery of fences blocking out the zombie hordes, however, I always imagined myself like a medieval monk cloistered away in his cell. No distractions, just the manuscript in front of me and the abbey walls surrounding me.Unfortunately, this mindset does not encourage a daily routine amidst the busyness of modern life. For as much as I would like to sit down and create a little every day, I need substantial time to get into the right head space. Keeping on top of academics, e-mails, grant proposals, festival applications, composition competitions, and mundane housework never provides more than an hour or so of daily free time during the term. Thus, I usually have to wait until the breaks between the university semesters to get a lot of music written. As it happens, this "vacation" period often coincides with the 11th hour before a commission/deadline is due. The pressure is on, the concepts have been germinating in my consciousness (maybe subconscious too) for months now, and my focus is like a laser-beam. I do have one big advantage when it comes to this countdown-- I have been planning the piece and researching the musical context like my life depended on it for weeks beforehand. Even though the first note has not yet been scribbled on the first measure, all of the macro elements of the composition have been thoroughly conceived. So, when it is "go-time" I am truly in the zone and working at a rate of quite high productivity. A representative example of a writing day for me would look like this:08:00AM Wake up, use the restroom, then sit at my desk. Look over the work from yesterday. Usually the efforts that extended long into last night are good, but due to the sleep-deprived / autopilot state, need immediate edits.11:00AM Walk into the kitchen and make something to eat. This is always "Spartan mode" (ramen noodles, PB & J, cold cut sandwich, frozen pizza, etc), anything that can be prepared very quickly with minimal effort. Oddly, I am not that hungry; too wrapped up in thought I suppose.12:00 Noon Back to the desk. The edits to yesterday\'s additions are usually done by this point. I look over where I left off in the piece, consult my pages of pre-compositional planning, and begin to generate material for the next part. Also, depending on the circumstance, around this time I occasionally will turn the wifi off of my laptop. The many e-mail pings and other notifications will become a major distraction. 04:00PM I shift my operation over to the surface of the bed at this point, as sitting all day has made me uncomfortable. I spread all my pages out in front of me so that I can refer to any concept with just a quick glance up. 07:00PM Return to the kitchen. Again, Spartan mode. If I have leftovers from earlier in the day I will eat that. Otherwise, I will make either the same thing as before or, if low on those ingredients, another quick dish. 08:00PM This is often a critical point. I have been awake for 12 hours and completed enough new material to have run into a conceptual or practical roadblock (musically speaking). I still feel in the zone though, and begin to pace around my apartment while pondering solutions to this issue or issues. 10:00PM I have come up with a plan of attack and am implementing this. Generally, it is unclear at first whether or not a given solution will work. Sadly, this means I have to compose a great deal of music before I can determine if it is a successful fix or if I need another approach. 12:00AM - 02:00AM (depending on the day) I am running solely on craft and inertia, trying to fulfill as much of the latest idea as possible while still making sense. Writing short notes about where this will continue the next day is commonplace, along with skeletal sketches. When I feel enough of the idea has been realized on the page for me to know how to pick it up again in the morning I try to go to sleep. As I close my eyes thoughts and combinations relating to the composition are still racing through my head. I jump up and run back to the desk to jot things down at least twice before actually falling asleep.The weeks of the year when I am actively writing a new composition I rarely leave my room. I do not compose at an instrument, such as a piano, and therefore do not need to be at an office or studio in order to get work done. As long as I have a place to sit and write in my manuscript book (maybe also an outlet for my laptop) I can be equally productive. I never need a board meeting to determine what direction the next project will take. If I get bored I can always change things up; go someplace new, write for instruments I have no experience with, tinker / experiment with other techniques / forms I have only heard in my head, and so on. No one can prevent me from pursuing a given direction in my music or have the authority to tell me otherwise.The deep isolation can be tough, not so much on me (I have always worked well alone), but on others close to me. Often I will catch a cold the week after I finish. My body and mind have been in such a state of prolonged stress that when I am ready to relax and let my guard down my immune system takes a break too. Thinking really hard about something for such a long time does require time afterwards to reset and readjust to "normal" life for me. With that being said, I would not trade it in for anything. Getting to witness wild abstractions come to life time and time again is the greatest feeling in the world. To this day after every performance of mine this notion continues to amaze me. The composition was just a blank sheet of paper not too long ago, and in that regard, all pieces start the same way. What fascinates me is that from this uniformly blank slate comes almost all music I have heard and will ever hear.'

For instance, the following excerpt from Aphorism 149--Human, All-Too-Human (1878)--represents one of his more controversial:In Bach there is still too much crude Christianity, crude Germanism, crude scholasticism; he stands on the threshold of modern European music, but looks back from there to the Middle Ages.In his essay, Fugue No. 7, author Timothy A. Smith goes on to point out that:Nine years earlier (in the same year he met Wagner) Nietzsche had also praised the St. Matthew Passion. He wrote to a friend that he hadattended three performances in one week, "each time with the samefeeling of immeasurable admiration." [...] Inevitably, Nietzsche\'s philosophical orientation compelled him to reject Bach\'s music. With their continual representations of form, rationalstructures, and "unsentimental sentiments" (to use Weaver\'s phrase),each fugue of the Well-Tempered Clavier would have been a powerfulexpression of the Apollonian "pathology" that had made German culture"sick."'

S" It could be there is some nuance or peculiarity present in most, if not all of the Mozart works you have heard that is lacking in other classical music compositions you have been exposed to thus far. Similarly, I know folks who state that Johnny Cash is the only country music they like. In their case, they probably do not like that genre's defining musical features, but for whatever reason are willing to ignore that for the sake of the artist's individual voice. In this example, they probably really prefer Cash's genre-spanning songs and sound embracing rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel...in spite of the fact he is primarily remembered as a country music icon. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple induction in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.Mozart also has a great deal of crossover appeal, and wrote in every major genre existing during his lifetime, including symphony, opera, the solo concerto, chamber music including string quartet and string quintet, and the piano sonata. In the end, it is important to remember that no creative figure exists as an island. The influence of Mozart is massive and you will be able to find any isolated characteristic inherent to his music in the works of his successors (and sometimes his predecessors). Though I stick by my ideology from What should I do about Classical Music compositions which I find boring?, I also strongly recommend that you listen to more composers to find additional elements that you can grab on to in other musics."

S" I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but there are simply not that many schools in the United States that guarantee full funding to all admitted composition students for stand-alone master's programs. Furthermore, those that do cover all expenses are certainly not overlooked by prospective applicants. For example, Yale School of Music and the Curtis Institute of Music generally post acceptance rates well below 10 percent. Wesleyan University also has a fully funded MA in composition. Their music department continues a phenomenal legacy of experimental music which has included esteemed faculty like Anthony Braxton and Alvin Lucier. Lastly, I have known a few composers who are extremely adept with technology that have completed fully funded multi-disciplinary master's degrees. The two to check out for this sort of path are Dartmouth College's Digital Musics Program and the MIT Media Lab.If you are determined to study music composition at the graduate level then please do not let these limited options dissuade you. There are a number of other factors to consider and possible outcomes. Other institutions do give select scholarships, they are just not guaranteed for all admitted students.

S' In addition to the great examples already here, I suggest checking out the Rachmaninov 5 tudes-tableaux, orchestrated by Ottorino Respighi. As a senior in high school I was quite familiar with these virtuoso piano pieces by Rachmaninoff. However, I was shocked that someone had the audacity to orchestrate such thoroughly pianistic works. Furthermore, Respighi\'s orchestrations actually happen to be superb, capturing the expressive gestures of the soloist and translating it into the massive machine that is the symphony orchestra. Often idiomatic writing for one instrument does not translate that well to another. For a side-by-side comparison I recommend listening to 4. Le chaperon rouge et le loup ("Little Red Riding Hood") from Op. 39, No. 6:Original solo piano versionhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Respighi orchestration (excerpt is at 17:48)http://youtu.be/y1th6B6cG-E?t=17...Lastly, according to Classical Archives:In 1929, conductor Serge Koussevitzky (who had already scored with his idea to have Maurice Ravel orchestrate Mussorgsky\'s Pictures at an Exhibition) suggested to his publisher, Editions Russe de Musique, that they should commission the brilliant Italian composer Ottorino Respighiwho was now internationally famous as a result of his tone-pictures The Pines of Rome and The Fountains of Rometo orchestrate a selection of Rachmaninov\'s tudes-tableaux. Fortunately, Rachmaninov, Respighi, and Editions Russe all agreed, and the orchestration of five of them soon came about.Earlier, Rachmaninov had kept the visual inspiration of the tudes-tableaux secret, saying, "I do not believe in the artist discussing too much of his images. Let them [the audience] paint for themselves what it most suggests." But with the Respighi orchestration project settled, he wrote his Italian colleague, "Will you permit me, Matre, to give you the secret explanations of their composer?" Rachmaninov sought thereby to aid Respighi find the right orchestral colors.'

S' Curtis Lindsay hit the nail on the head, piano transcriptions of orchestral music used to be the norm. Composers would often write a piano short score or piano four-hands before orchestrating the work. For example, you will find a number of piano versions for Rachmaninoff\'s symphonic pieces. My favorite happens to be the composer\'s final work, Op. 45 Symphonic Dances.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...Similarly, solo piano, piano four-hands, and various orchestrations exist for Brahms\' most famous works (notably the Hungarian Dances). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=... Another major composer/virtuoso pianist known for these such efforts was Franz Liszt, who famously created solo piano arrangements of all the Beethoven Symphonies. My top pick from this series is his take on Symphony No. 6 ("Pastorale").https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=... Lastly, there are some interesting piano versions of orchestral works arranged by pianists.

If you have not already checked Cowell's solo piano works out, then I recommend starting here.http://youtu.be/zIZ5vt6a6Uc Next, I would be remiss if I did not then mention John Cage (1912-1992) and his pioneering work Sonatas and Interludes (1946-1948). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...

S'  There is no secret, however, if you do these things you can be sure to get the most out of any classical music experience.Read up on the background and context before listening, and ask yourself-- +What is the composer tying to accomplish here?+When and where was the work written? +What else was going on around that time and place?This will completely change how you listen. Many compositions have several layers of understanding, and without prior knowledge of the history and tradition only the most visceral, surface elements will be immediately clear. The surface might turn out to be enjoyable already, but just imagine how much better it would be if you saw the whole picture. Composers spend a tremendous amount of time endowing their works with depth, subtitles, and nuances. They use these efforts to draw relationships and comment on other music, art, literature, philosophy, society, culture, and the world at large.Today, for the vast majority of classical music, the answers to the above questions are easily available online. Classical Archives and Wikipedia are great places to start. Symphony orchestras and publishing companies upload program notes too. These notes are often written by the composer, a music director, music critic, or another specialist and concisely tell you what you need to know. Also, the BBC has produced a number of high quality documentaries about the lives and works of several famed classical composers. These are certainly worth checking out and will provide a great deal of insight. (see Where can I study about classical music?)Attend live performances with a friend, then discuss the concert afterwards. Classical music, from solo recitals and chamber ensembles to symphony orchestras and opera productions, is best as a communal experience. Conductors, composers, and music scholars frequently give pre-concert talks or lectures. Be sure to arrive at the venue early to hear these, as they are highly illuminating. In fact, concertgoers who are new to classical music and tying to get into the genre often tell me that they enjoy performances much more after hearing someone talk about the program. Watch closely to the physical movements and gestures of the conductor and performers. These musicians have spent decades honing their craft and it is astonishing how they are able to transform little black dots on a page to expressive narratives. If you can, take a look at the score and parts to "see under the hood" of what is required of them. After the event try to hang around for a little bit and chat with the musicians. Ask them all sorts of questions-- What was their favorite part of the concert? Which passage was the most difficult to learn? Etc.It helps to go with a friend, but even if going alone, do feel free to create a dialogue with other patrons. Have an opinion and discuss. Many classical compositions are intended to be thought provoking. Seek out those who are already highly knowledgeable about classical music and ask for recommendations. Classical music encompasses thousands of distinct composers over hundreds of years. The differences can be massive, and navigating such breadth can at times feel overwhelming. Talk to people who know more than you (I do this all the time) and ask them to point you towards music you are not yet familiar with. Put their recommendations through the who, what, when, where, and how. As for modern composers, it is a bit difficult to recommend without knowing more about someone\'s preferences. Like before, there are thousands of living composers writing in many different (sometimes opposing) styles. My advice is to listen to a wide variety of major figures with different aesthetics. Right away follow up on the ones you connect with, but also be sure to return to those you didn\'t. Musical taste is not set in stone, and yours will surely shift over time. Here is a sampling of big name composers today across many styles (in no particular order): George Benjamin, John Adams, Helmut Lachenmann, Kaija Saariaho, Joan Tower, Louis Andriessen, Phillip Glass, John Zorn, Augusta Read Thomas, Pierre Boulez, Steve Reich, Brian Ferneyhough, Sofia Gubaidulina, Thomas Ades, Tan Dun, Pauline Oliveros, Jennifer Higdon, Georg Friedrich Haas, James MacMillan, Unsuk Chin, Peter Maxwell Davies, John Harbison, Hans Abrahamsen, Arvo Prt.'

S' Virtually none whatsoever, in the same sense that Marxist theories generally have virtually no impact whatsoever in any practical endeavor.But to give a bit more detail. The Wikipedia entry on "Technological determinism" gives several quotes outlining what the term is generally understood to mean: "echnological determinism has been summarized as \'The belief in technology as a key governing force in society ...\' (Merritt Roe Smith). \'The idea that technological development determines social change ...\' (Bruce Bimber). It changes the way people think and how they interact with others and can be described as \'...a three-word logical proposition: "Technology determines history"\' (Rosalind Williams) . It is, \'... the belief that social progress is driven by technological innovation, which in turn follows an "inevitable" course.\' (Michael L. Smith). This \'idea of progress\' or \'doctrine of progress\' is centralised around the idea that social problems can be solved by technological advancement, and this is the way that society moves forward. Technological determinists believe that "\'You can\'t stop progress\', implying that we are unable to control technology" (Lelia Green). This suggests that we are somewhat powerless and society allows technology to drive social changes because, "societies fail to be aware of the alternatives to the values embedded in it [technology]" (Merritt Roe Smith)." Technological determinismThose are not views which I have ever heard expressed by either Lila Tretikov nor Sue Gardner, both of whom have a much more complex and nuanced understanding of the relationship between gender and technology.But it\'s also important to harken back to what I said about "practical endeavor". We know there are several different issues with Wikipedia\'s gender gap - some of them are technological, some of them are social in the sense of issues in society at large, and some of them are social in the sense of issues with Wikipedia\'s own internal culture.'

You\'ll want to tone down a bit the things that might offend them such as "neither of them have any hard skills that can\'t be done by myself" - statements like that will not put them in a mood to think of your proposal positively.If there really is that much imbalance, then you could quit today and start a competitor, right? And if that isn\'t correct, then observe that it isn\'t exactly true that you don\'t need them. :)Another idea that could work is to propose that you are named CEO and given a pay package that includes some significant equity which accrues if you hit some ambitious milestones. To sell them on this, point out that they\'ll be happy with 25% each of a company worth $$$$$ than 1/3 of a company only worth $. Make it a win-win in their minds, and structure the deal so that the equity position changes only as you deliver on your promises.'

S' In Wikipedia shorthand, this is what we call BLP1E - Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons notable for only one event.In general, we avoid and take great caution in writing biographies of people who are suddenly in the news for one thing. Walter Palmer was, before this incident, not even remotely notable. It is very likely that there is not enough information about him even given his current notoriety to write a quality biography.What we usually do instead is recognize that it is the event which is notable.In this case, the event is covered pretty thoroughly here: Cecil (lion).If he goes on to do other newsworthy things, then of course we would eventually have a biography.'

S' By the nonexistent power vested in me as Founder of Wikipedia, I hereby dub thee His Royal Highness Prince Ashton, Duke of Kitturcat.This is absolutely without meaning of any kind, but you didn\'t waste your money on some Internet scam selling you a false title. And I bet your friends will find this far cooler anyway.Edit/Addition: Ok, that\'s a humorous answer and quite popular but someone pointed out that it isn\'t necessarily obviously helpful. I\'m editing here to add some thoughts that I think are helpful - mainly expanding my comment about not wasting money on some Internet scam.First, no real royal titles are available for sale, period. There is a sense that if you donate enough money to a political party in the UK, through a system that isn\'t fully corrupt but looks questionable enough to many people, you may be rewarded with some kind of title - a knighthood/damehood or a peerage title. None of those are really *royal* titles, though.Second, the titles that are for sale are either from pretty much made-up nations like Sealand - such that I\'d call them an Internet scam, or there are these odd "Lord of the Manor" titles that make you seem like a jerk if you buy one and try to use it. And the latter are kind of expensive. There are better ways to seem like a jerk, in my opinion.I\'ve never known anyone who actually bought any sort of title - or anyway never anyone who admitted it. But it\'s a common enough question on the Internet, and like owning a little piece of land on Mars or paying to have a star named after you, I suppose some people do it just for the novelty as something to talk about as a joke with friends.So my point was - don\'t do that. There are more fun things to do. This is my personal advice.'

You will learn that the vast majority of the money to support Wikipedia comes from the small donors.

S' I have lived in London for several years.One thing to know about London is that it is very much a city of highly diverse neighborhoods. So there is probably no single answer here that would cover the entire city. There are very liberal and gay-friendly parts of town and there are areas which are more conservative and with a large Muslim population - but even in this case see my note below for some additional thoughts.I can only speak confidently about areas where I\'ve lived and worked - basically central London from Shoreditch to Notting Hill. In these areas, not only will no one mock you, I rather suspect that very few will even particularly notice.Regarding the other areas, I hope someone who is more directly familiar will answer, but I do note this: even though an area like Tower Hamlets has a Muslim population of around 100,000 (35%) and should be presumed to be more conservative on gay issues, there are reasons to think you\'d be fine there. First, some quick googling shows that there are a few gay bars and pubs in Tower Hamlets. And second, the taboo against same-sex holding hands is not really a Muslim thing anyway. To quote Wikipedia: "In many cases, people of the same sex holding hands while walking is considered an ordinary display of friendship without romantic connotations." (from: Etiquette in the Middle East) See also: The Basics; Why Arab Men Hold Hands from the New York Times.I am unsure how that plays out in terms of the culture of London, I just throw it out there as a point for further research. For one thing, the London Muslim population is not predominantly Arab, so the links above may not apply - I just don\'t know.'

And our prices are a good value in the marketplace. How do we afford this? We have to eliminate most of the marketing budget and spread virally, by word of mouth, primarily online.We say to you: you can stay with your current carrier, and they'll spend a huge chunk of your money on more tv commercials, radio commercials, magazine and newspaper ads, flyers mailed to your home, billboards, bus signs, etc. Or you can switch to us and we'll spend that money on something that you care about. What we ask in return is that you tell your family, tell your friends.And the social network is a great tool for doing that. It also serves as a donation platform for our cause partners, and we offer that to the partners without commissions - this drives people to the platform, where, eventually, they may want to buy phone service.The basic concept is to get rid of the traditional marketing budget and instead be fully community-oriented.I hope this answer clarifies things for you!"

This is a family playing and momentarily referencing a gesture many would have seen from contemporary news reels.\'No-one at that time had any sense how it would evolve. To imply anything else is misleading and dishonest.\'"I would add to that: whatever one may think of the parents doing that gesture at that time (I am less forgiving than the palace quote given above), the Queen herself was 7 years old.

S' The short answer is that probably all natural languages distinguish words that are \'nouny\' from words that are \'verby\', but in some languages the contrast is very unclear. To understand this though, you need to understand what a part of speech is. A \'part of speech\' is a traditional phrase that refers to a distribution class: if you have a string of words, only some words can be replaced with other words without creating an ungrammatical string. For example in "John ran into the X", "X" can be replaced with "house", "woods", "river" etc. but not "sing", "cogitate", "impress", because the former but not the latter are syntactically nouns which can be the head of a noun phrase. In most languages, the distinction between nouns and verbs is not only fairly straightforward syntactically like this, they are also morphologically distinct: a noun will inflect with a completely different class of affixes than a verb would.I say some, because even very familiar languages do not have an absolutely watertight contrast between nouns and verbs. English, for example, allows null-conversion (i.e. change of part of speech without overt affixation) surprisingly freely:Even in English, such cases can usually be explained by mere homophony, since these cases are the exception rather than the rule. Other languages are far less clear however. English divides nouns, verbs and adjectives into fairly clear classes, but very many languages treat all adjectives as either nouns or verbs syntactically. For example in Mohawk, all adjectives inflect for person, number, tense and gender just like regular verbs:(1) a. ka-hutsi (Baker 1996) NsS-black \'It is black\' b. t-a\'-ka-ya\'t-v\'-ne\' CIS-FACT-NsS-body-fall-PUNC \'It fell\' In this language, using an inflected verb is the only way to indicate that something is black -- there is no independent class of adjectives. This much is very common around the world, but Mohawk goes even further, since it also appears to be able to use fully inflected finite verbs as if they were nouns:(2) Akaterohrkha kken teiiaks a-k-ate-rohrok-ha- kik te-yo-yak-s OPT-1AGT-MID-watch-DIS-PRF this DUP-NEUT.PAT-cut-IMPF "I would go watch this movie." (lit. "I would watch this it-flickers") (Mithun 1999: 59)Other languages collapse the contrast between adjectives and nouns or verbs in other ways. Georgian does not clearly distinguish adjectives from nouns in the sense that a nominal usually used to modify another nominal (\'adjective\') can stand in as the head noun itself:  lurji \'blue\' can be either an adjective or just mean \'the blue (thing/one)\'. Georgian also has many nouns that are based on participles of different types, either currently or in the past:(3) a.  c\'erili \'letter\'  < c\'er-il-i write-PART-NOM (lit. \'the written thing\') b.  damlagebeli \'cleaning lady, housekeeper\' < da-m-lag-eb-el-i PVB-PART-clean-TH-PART-NOM (lit. \'the cleaning one\') c.  pexsacmeli \'shoe\' < pex-sa-c-m-el-i foot-FUT.PART-wear-TH-PART-NOM) (lit. \'for wearing on the foot\') d.  sac\'oli \'bed\' < sa-c\'ol-i FUT.PART-lie-NOM (lit. \'for lying down\')Although these are synchronically nouns, and so are all marked with a case suffix, they originate as participles which are sometimes considered verbal in nature (depending on one\'s theory of syntax and morphology) -- they are certainly \'mixed categories\' in some sense. Some scholars have gone further however in arguing that some languages have absolute syntactic underspecification -- all lexical roots can function as all parts of speech, depending on context. David Gil has argued that Riau Indonesian is one such language. Take for example samples from his corpus:(4) a. A noun functioning as the predicate of the clause: Orang bahasa Inggeris sama David?  person language English with David  "Did people (speak) English with (you) David?" b. A verb phrase functioning as an argument of the predicate  Tunggu taxi susa sekali  wait taxi difficult very  "Waiting for a taxi is very difficult." c. A verb functioning as a modifier  Beli nasi goreng aku  buy rice fry 1:SG  "I bought the fried rice." (Page on und.edu)Such cases are controversial, because they call into question some of the most fundamental tenets of 20th century linguistic theorizing about grammatical universals. It will probably be a long time before we have enough data from enough languages to make a definitive statement about whether nouns and verbs are truly universal categories in all languages -- or not.'

S" No, in fact, the word is used much more often in American publications than in British publications.First off, the word is very new. It basically didn't exist (as a common idiom at least) before the 1950s in either country. After that it rises quickly. Here's the chart for American usage:Now look at British usage:Looks pretty similar, right? Although it starts slightly earlier in the British data, actually, there's a big difference. If you look at the frequency numbers at the left-hand side, you'll note that today unflappable is approximately twice as frequent in American publications as it is in British ones. This does not necessarily reflect spoken usage, but it does indicate that educated people on the left side of the pond are not only familiar with the term, they use it much more frequently."

S" In linguistics, the terms finite and nonfinite (usually without a hyphen) refer to an entirely different domain of language than the term infinite. As I mentioned in a previous answer (What is the difference between a finite verb and a nonfinite verb?), finite and nonfinite are morphological aspects of verbal paradigms: a nonfinite verb form lacks overt marking for features like person, number and tense that a finite verb has (i.e. it is not 'limited' by them). Thus the difference between the two terms depends on the shape of the verb.Infiniteness in language is something altogether different. In linguistics, infinite refers to the fact that natural languages are syntactically recursive, meaning the rules can apply to their own output:This property of syntax leads to discrete infinity, since the set of such sentences is infinite (even though each of those individual sentences is itself of finite length).Thus, nonfinite and infinite are both technical terms that have different but important nonoverlapping meanings in linguistic theory because of the domain they apply to."

S" In essence, it's because the exact conditions under which Germans arrived in the United States were very different from those which modern Hispanics find in the American Southwest. As I noted in another answer (Given that the United States is a nation of immigrants, how did the English language come to dominate the nation?), the first English settlers created a founder effect (Founder effect) on language use within the colonies:A founder effect results from an expansion of a diverse population into new areas, resulting in lower differential diffusion of features in those new areas.German settlers arrived late (the earliest small groups coming only in the 1680s or so), and tended to arrive in small groups of individuals or small families, only rarely creating large self-contained colonies. By the time that Germans started to come in large numbers, in the mid-19th century, there were already millions of English speakers throughout the eastern part of North America into which they could be quickly assimilated.The situation with Hispanics was very different, almost the reverse. English speakers arrived in the Southwest very late -- the first came to the easternmost areas of Texas only in the early 19th century, about three centuries after the Spanish-speakers did. Although there were not huge numbers of Hispanics in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona or California at that time (see also my answer: If Texas is a former Mexican state, how come Spanish isn't the main language used in Texas?), they continued to outnumber English speakers for a number of decades, until the mid to late 19th century. To this day, some parts of the Southwest are still overwhelmingly Spanish-speaking; Laredo, TX, e.g. is 92% Hispanophone. Thus Kelly Martin's answer is only partially correct: the continued use of German faced a host of sociolinguistic difficulties long before the 20th century's worldwars made Germans social pariahs."

S" No, (pace Lee Ballentine and Alan Dawkins) it is not true, for two reasons:(1) In English, not all Latin-derived words retain their original Latinate plural endings. Thus scientific words like antenna can have a plural antennae (alongside the Anglo-Saxon antennas, with different meanings attached to the distinct plurals), and a Kulturwort like forum can sometimes (in highstyle) take a Latinate plural fora, but the vast majority of Latin words directly imported into English do not retain their Latinate plurals. Thus abacus, abdomen, apex, creditor, geranium, iris, museum, ratio, Sphinx, and virus do not become abaci, abdomines, apices, creditores, gerania, irides, musea, rationes, Sphinges and viri.(2) Even in Latin, the plural of penis is not penii, but penes. In Latin, the word originally meant 'tail', and like almost all third declension nouns, the -is suffix in the nominative singular becomes the an -es suffix in the nominative plural."

S' While I am loath to call into question Stephen Tempest\'s interesting summary of the mythopoetic literature on Roman place names, there is a much more realistic answer available: the \'Alba\' in \'Alba Longa\' does not mean \'white\' at all, but is a relic of a (pre-?)Indo-European substrate root for mountain and river place names found across Europe.Across Europe, there are dozens of very ancient place names that begin with Alb-/Alp-:These toponyms typically fall into two different kinds of geographical features: Rivers and bodies of waterHills or mountainsThus among mountains or mountainous regions we find the Alps, the Alban Hills of Rome, Albania, Alba in the Piedmont of Italy, and both Alba and Albany, respectively Celtic and Middle English names for Scotland (rather known for its mountains), and famously Albion as a name for England/Britain. We also find other variations, such as Alm, Austria, where an \'alm\' is a word for a mountain pasture. The other common meaning is usually rivers, of which there are many: the Elbe, Alf and Alb rivers in Germany; the Aube in France (< Vulgar Latin *Alba); suffixed forms like Germany\'s Elber (<*Albira) or Spain\'s Albuera (< *Albora), or Switzerland\'s Alvra, and in antiquity another name for the Tiber was Albula (= \'little Alba\'). All the variants have /al/ plus a labial consonant, plus possible suffixes. [1]The distribution of these place names seems pretty pan-European, and so it has been speculated that these place names are the last remnants of some pre-Indo-European language. But if so, it is curious that the greatest density of such place names was in formerly Celtic speaking parts of Europe, such as France, Britain, southern Germany, northern Italy, and central Spain. Since it is also found as far south as Rome in Italy, some scholars believe this root was a relic from the remote time when Italic languages and Celtic languages were still one speech community, some 4000 years ago. It\'s also notable that these two meanings were conflated in one word, though this is no more surprising than any language having homophones, like the multiple meanings of English \'set\'.Thus \'Alba Longa\' means simply and rather prosaically "tall mountain".[1] Note that not all words that begin with Al- are related to this root. Many Spanish placenames come instead from far more recent Arabic loanwords with the Arabic definite article al- prefixed, such as Albacete, which originally was Al-Basit \'the plain\'.'

S" Unless you are not a native speaker of English, there's no sense in talking about 'recommending' how to speak, since all native English speakers speak (their own form of) English correctly, ipso facto. Some native speakers use themself as the reflexive form of (singular) they, while others (including me) use themselves for reflexive they, whether singular or plural reference. However, it's worth pointing out that this reflexive form of singular they is directly analogous to other originally plural pronouns that are used as singulars. The pronoun you historically was exclusively plural (the singular was thou); when thou disappeared and you filled its place, the reflexive form was originally generally yourselves, even when it had singular reference:As you can see in this chart, starting in the mid 18th century, you in its singular sense acquired a distinctly singular reflexive pronoun yourself (though this had actually been knocking around for a number of centuries, it was not generalized). Likewise, other pronouns like we sometimes had singular reference, and developed singular reflexive pronouns as a result. Thus a monarch might use ourself when using the royal we, such as this note to Parliament by King Charles II in 1662:Certainly, if a king said it, it must be grammatical, right? In any event, by analogy, what we are seeing with themself is the extension of a pronominal paradigm to keep up with the reality of reference in the language."

S" Answering this question is not easy for a variety of reasons. First, Georgians have a bad habit of essentializing words in their language as 'Georgian' (or: Kartvelian) or not, as if a word that has been used for a thousand years is not sufficiently Georgian enough to count as part of modern Georgian usage. This is true even of Georgian intellectuals and academics, who are educated enough to know better.Second, as Irakli Kavtaradze mentioned, in part because of the first problem, there is no one etymological dictionary of all words that Georgians actually use. There are only two major works:Klimov's Etymological Dictionary of the Kartvelian Languages, which is an excellent source for any Kartvelologist working with old texts or investigating how Georgian relates to Megrelian, Laz or Svan. This dictionary also makes some attempt at noting possible early loans words from Indo-European, Semitic, Caucasian and other languages.Fhnrich's Kartwelisches Etymologisches Wrterbuch, which covers much of the same ground as Klimov's, without however taking much note of any loanwords.In both cases, the vast majority of words that have been borrowed in the last 1000 years or so (and essentially all the huge numbers of words borrowed in the last 200) are not listed because they are not relevant for reconstructing Proto-Kartvelian, which started to split apart more than 3000 years ago. Third, there is a genuine problem of defining what a word is. Georgian and other Kartvelian languages are polysynthetic, in the sense that words often have six or more affixes (with a maximum of 12) for all kinds of categories: person, number, tense, aspect, mood, evidentiality, voice, etc. What in English might be several words in Georgian often becomes one word, because Georgian has so much morphology to build new words. Thus, even a word that clearly is borrowed like  varjii 'exercise' often gets Kartvelian morphology attached to it (e.g.  varjiobs 'he exercises') , thus blurring the line between a loan-word and native word. Lastly, there is the issue of an 'expiration date' for how long a loanword continues to be considered a loanword. For example,  k'ak'abi 'partridge' was probably borrowed from Hittite or some Anatolian Indo-European language into Proto-Kartvelian, or possibly somewhat later, more than 3000 years ago. Does this still count as a loanword, since we know its source? What about the more recent  bat'oni 'master, mister, lord', which ultimately goes back to Latin patronus 'master, lord, patron', but is now the common everyday courtesy title for adult men? There is no obvious point when a loanword becomes a Georgian word -- except that words that Georgians use, are Georgian. However, to give you some sort of straightforward answer, I went through Aronson's dictionary of Georgian lexemes used in his chrestomathy to get an idea of how frequent loanwords are in actual modern texts. Based on that (very superficial survey subject to revision), something like 30-40% of the modern Georgian lexicon is obviously foreign in origin, with modern 'international' words being now the largest and most productive source of loans:By international, I mean words that might have entered Georgian through a specific source language (often Russian), but which are themselves not native to that language, and which are often literary or scientific in nature -- things like  aviacia (aviation),  aerop'ort'i (airport),  ek'onomik'uri (economic), the word  internacionaluri 'international' itself, etc. After that, the largest source in the sample was Greek, which provided not only religious and cultural terms like  ek'lesia (church) and  eteri (ether) but also very many Georgian personal names like  Erek'le (Heracles),  Tornik'e (Tornikios), and  Giorgi (George). (Sometimes of course the line between 'international words' and 'Greek/Latin words' is not always obvious, and has more to do with the context of borrowing than anything else.) Another large source of loanwords are Persian, Turkish, Arabic and Armenian words, but in these cases (due to the lack of available materials) it is not always easy to determine if a given word that is obviously not western comes from specifically one of these three languages, since many words of Middle Eastern origin were spread through all of these languages. Georgian  bai 'garden' and  angarii 'the bill, the check' certainly come ultimately from Persian, but it is not clear whether it was borrowed through an intermediary language. Words from Arabic often are borrowed like this through an intermediary source: Georgian  ekimi 'medical doctor' ultimately comes from Arabic hakim, but was probably borrowed via Turkish because of the vowel-harmony in ekimi. One last source of loanwords in Georgian is Russian, in which most Georgians are still fluent and which still influences their speech. Surprisingly few truly Russian words have entered into Georgian speech: words like  vap'she 'in general',  vsio 'complete, done',  p'rost'a 'simply' all fall into this category. I want to emphasize that no one really has done the proper research on this issue, so my estimate above is more like a guestimate. But it gives you some idea of the distribution of loans and native words."

S" The short answer is yes: many languages that have more than three genders have special genders that distinguish domesticated from wild animals, or edible food from inedible vegetation, or the like. (More than three genders? Yes: see my previous answers: Are there languages that have more than three grammatical genders? and Is gender in a language a misleading word?)As I noted in previous answers, gender in language is simply one way of dividing the world up into categories of things, so it should not be surprising that food, which is important in all human societies, ranks among the categories most frequently marked in language gender systems. Among the Ngangikurrunggur (an aboriginal language of Australia), nouns get divided into nine different genders depending on a combination of what marker they have on the noun (1), how possessive adjectives are formed (2), and what marker surfaces on adjectives (3):(source: Corbett, Gender, p. 140)As you can see, two of the nine genders are wholly dedicated to food sources, and several of the others also indirectly refer to food acquisition (weapons and tools help in food acquisition and processing, dogs help track down and seize prey). Other languages that single out different kinds of food sources in different genders:The Papuan language Yimas has some 11 noun genders, of which one is semantically defined by higher animals (like cassowaries, crocodiles and the like), and another one is defined by important plants, like sago palms or coconut palms. (Most of the genders in this language are purely phonologically defined by the ending of the noun.) [1]The Australian language Warndarang has five genders in the singular, including one for plants with edible underground parts; one for trees; and one for large animals. [2]Another Australian language Gurrgoni has four genders, one for 'masculines', one for 'feminines', one for vegetables, and one for all remaining nouns. [3]One of the Yimas People. Photo credit: Chris Rainier, The Last Speakers: The Quest to Save the World's Most Endangered Languages.Even in languages which do not have genders dedicated to particular classes of food, there can be generalizations about how particular foods get assigned to particular genders. In the Algonquian language Meskwaki, there are only two genders: animate and inanimate. Assignment to these two genders is very largely predictable based on the meaning of the noun -- living things are animate, nonliving things are inanimate -- but in a few liminal cases there is variation. Thus large animals such as buffalo which are typically food sources are assigned to the animate gender, while smaller animals can often be assigned to the inanimate gender. [4]So indeed, there is some generalization: languages do tend to 'genderize' the kinds of foods that are important to them, and they do tend to distinguish between protein sources and sources of carbohydrates.[1] also Corbett, Gender, p. 56[2]-[3]: Dixon, Australian Languages, p. 473 and p. 482.[4] Dahlstrom, Ms., A Grammar of the Meskwaki Language."

S" It turns out that many features of Indo-European languages of Europe, including English, are quite unusual in comparison to human languages generally -- but other IE languages are so normal that it's difficult to compare them. A few years back the Dutch linguist Michael Cysouw used the features described in the World Atlas of Language Structures to create a rarity index of the world's languages. The rarity index was mathematically formulated (see Cysouw's paper for more details [1]); if the mean rarity index of all languages found in WALS is 1.0, then languages with rarity indices of 2.0 or 3.0 are unusual, and languages with 8.0 or 10.0 are bizarre. Languages not only had absolute rarity indices, but relative ones as well in order to identify geographic clusters of languages with relatively large numbers of unusual features, resulting in this map:In this map, the darker the dot, the more that language is surrounded by languages which also have high rarity indices. What do we find? We find that most Indo-European languages from Europe have high numbers of rare features, comparable to northern Australia, the Pacific Northwest of North America and the Bolivian Amazon. What are those features, according to Cysouw? He enumerates 10:Some of these features are merely blips and are found in different branches of Indo-European; some however are highly exotic, ranging to the bizarre. For example, the idea of rearranging your word order to form questions from statements (a feature of English and most Germanic languages) is exceedingly rare -- out of 955 languages in the sample, most (585) languages use a question particle, and almost all the rest use special affixes on the verb (164) or special question intonation (173). Only 13 languages -- mostly European ones -- change the word order to indicate questions. That puts English, German and Dutch in the 1% of language weirdness, for that feature. [2]Although at one geographical end of the family there are some really quite weird languages all clustered together, at the other geographical extent we find quite the opposite, languages with rarity indices lower than 1.0. Most of these languages are Indo-Aryan languages of India. Cysouw doesn't go into much detail about typological mundanity (he's writing about rarity after all) but his work does point to an important conclusion with respect to the OP's question: with respect to language typology, Indo-European does not really function as a single cluster of traits, so there really aren't traits common to all (or even most) that are not also shared by some languages elsewhere.[1] At: http://www.cysouw.de/home/articles_files/cysouwRARA.pdf[2] For more details on these features, you can read WALS chapters online at WALS Online - Chapters."

S' Yes. Although it\'s not traditionally considered to be a verbal category in English, inflection for negation is found on certain auxiliary verbs. Doesn\'t also features inflection for person, number, tense and mood. Here\'s what I said in my answer to How did "aren\'t" become the contraction of "am not"?__-N\'t as a Verb InflectionEnglish is somewhat unusual among European languages in that some English verbs can inflect for negation:can, can\'twill, won\'tfind, *findn\'tHistorically, of course, -n\'t was simply a reduced form of not, but over the centuries it not only became pronounced differently, it began to be used differently from the non-encliticized, or free, form not. For example:it doesn\'t always attach to the positive form but sometimes attaches to a different, irregular form (will vs. won\'t, shall vs. shan\'t);it doesn\'t attach to all English verbs, but only to certain auxiliaries: could/couldn\'t but not regular verbs like anticipate/*anticipaten\'t or even some auxiliaries like may/*mayn\'t.it doesn\'t attach to words that already have clitics: *I\'dn\'t be doing that if I were you.it exhibits unpredictable semantic peculiarities. For example between different negated auxiliaries you can get different scopes of negation: you mustn\'t go home means that it is the case that you must not go home, while you can\'t go home means that it is not the case that you can go home.(See the classic Zwicky and Pullum 1983 paper for more about -n\'t.)'

S" Most of the other answers give one possible form of disagreement: when the features of the verb and the features of the subject fail to match in some recognized way. However, I'm going to argue here that this kind of disagreement is just a subtype of a more general phenomenon, and it sheds light on what agreement is doing in the first place.What is Agreement, anyway?First we have to unpack this rather complicated idea. Usually when you say that a verb agrees with the subject, you're saying that the form of the verb changes in response to some feature of the argument, such as person and number:The boy runs.In this sentence, the verb has a suffix -s that refers back to the argument of the sentence: boy. However, if we look at a wider paradigm, we see that this is the only instance when the verb 'responds' to the properties of the noun: I run we run you run y'all run the boy runs the boys runIn all other cases, the form of the verb is not changing in response to the properties of the noun. So are the other five forms agreeing with the noun, or not? On at least one reading, the morphological one, they are not agreeing with it, since they show no evidence of changing their form in accord with their argument. It is only when we look at the paradigm as a whole that the question of agreement even comes up: one form demands a certain affix, and the others do not. Controllers, Targets and ConditionsThe simple English example shows that agreement is a matter of specific grammatical contexts (controllers) triggering specific responses in the agreement targets. In some languages, the effect a controller has on its agreement target is absolute: if a subject noun is plural, the verb will agree with the noun in number [1]. Typical European languages act this way: just think of German, Latin or Russian. However, in some languages, additional conditions have to be met before an agreement controller will actually trigger agreement in its target. In the Georgian language, for example, only animate or motile nouns can trigger plural agreement; if the noun is not animate and cannot move on its own, then it triggers only singular agreement on the verb, while still being marked overtly as plural on the noun:Animate nouns: (1) k'ac-eb-i dga-nan (*dga-s) ezo-i man-PL-NOM stand-3PL (*stand-3sg) courtyard-in 'The men are standing in the courtyard.'(2) it'-eb-i gada-prin-av-en (*gada-prin-av-s) bird-PL-NOM PVB-fly-TH-3PL (*PVB-fly-TH-3sg) 'The birds are flying away.'Motile nouns:(3) mankan-eb-i dga-nan (*dga-s) gara-i car-PL-NOM stand-3pl (*stand-3sg) garage-in 'The cars are standing in the garage.'(4) nav-eb-i t'ivt'iv-eb-en (*t'ivt'iv-eb-s) zva-ze boat-PL-NOM float-TH-3pl (float-TH-3sg) sea-on 'The boats are floating on the sea.'Inanimate/nonmotile nouns:(5) mt-eb-i ar-is / (*ar-ian) lamaz-i mountain-PL-NOM be-3sg (*be-3pl) beautiful-NOM 'The mountains are beautiful.'(6) ku-eb-i ar-is / (*ar-ian) uvnebel-i ame-s street-PL-NOM be-3sg (*be-3pl) safe-NOM night-DAT 'The streets are safe at night.'As you can see, Georgian is quite different from English, because although like English it does have overt morphology to indicate third person agreement, in some cases it fails to use it when you would expect it to. There is another class of exception: overtly quantified noun phrases. If even an animate noun phrase is quantified with a numeral or some kind of quantifier, then both the noun and the verb must be marked in the singular:(7) sam-i k'ac-i dga-s (*dga-nan) ezo-i three-NOM man-NOM stand-3sg (*stand-3pl) courtyard-in 'Three men are standing in the courtyard.'Crucially, these exceptions constitute natural semantic and syntactic classes, so the subject-verb disagreement falls along predictable lines. What such examples illustrate is that the system of subject-verb agreement depends on specific facts in specific languages, and those facts can vary considerably from language to language; in some languages, subject-verb disagreement is not only allowed, it is obligatory in certain contexts.[1] In point of fact, agreement with the subject could be considered a kind of condition, but I will ignore that for purposes of this discussion."

S' No. But: when you\'re discussing the linguistic history of a country with a documented history of about three or four millennia, all sorts of things have happened, so you have to be specific about which time period you\'re talking about. The people who wrote works like this:(Safavid miniature of a work by Nizami)Were not the same people who wrote works like this:(The Caucasian Albanian alphabet)As I discussed in my answer "What is the history of Azerbaijan, it\'s people and culture?", many different languages have been (and indeed still are) spoken in Azerbaijan, with the following languages having been dominant in roughly the following order:Caucasian Albanian (aka Old Udi) -- the ancestor of the modern Udi language (ca. 3000 BC - ca. 1500 BC, and again from around the first century AD until the 9th or so)Some form of Indo-Iranian (ca. 2000 BC -- 500 BC), which evolved into numerous offshoot languages of Azerbaijan including:  proto-Tat, the language of Baku in the 19th century; and proto-Talysh.Later, and outside Azerbaijan Proper, various forms of Persian became very influential as a result of the various Persian Empires (Achaemenid, Parthian, Sasanian, Safavid, etc.)Starting in the 11th century, Oghuz Turkic migrations into the region gradually altered its ethnolinguistic balance and language shift began toward a form of Turkic.The later form of Persian, not native to Azerbaijan itself, influenced all the arts and literature of the region, including Nizami in Ganja and Rustaveli in Georgia. Nizami himself was of mixed Persian/Kurdish background (his father was probably from Qom, but his mother was Kurdish).But in any event the answer is no, because there have always been speakers of other languages in Azerbaijan, and Persian was only ever at some points one among many, and a foreign interloper at that.'

S" To a certain extent this idea that ergative constructions (in which the object of transitive verbs are treated the same as subjects of intransitive verbs) are somehow 'primitive' is little more than exoticizing myth: people from where we are from don't speak that way, so it's those people who are weird. Obviously, the people who actually live in Australia or the Pacific Northwest of America or the Caucasus can't be remote from themselves.Nonetheless, it is true that the distribution of ergativity is skewed toward particular parts of the world and not others. If you look at this map from the World Atlas of Language Structures, you will see that there is a typological cline from west to east in which the more westerly a language is spoken, the more likely that language is to have no evidence of ergativity: The distribution of languages with ergativity in full noun phrasesHere, you can see that the languages of western Eurasia and Africa have an almost exclusively neutral or nominative alignment in full NPs. As you proceed in an easterly direction, you get your first cluster of ergative languages in the Caucasus, then again in the Himalayas, then again quite a few across Melanesia and Australia, and again in the Pacific Northwest and the Amazon.Why would there be such a cline? The answer almost certainly has nothing to do with the level of 'advancement' of the languages. This idea, called the stadialist hypothesis, was quite popular especially in the Soviet Union in the late 20th century, and held that languages advance through several distinct stages in a unidirectional fashion:First, the most primitive languages start out as Activestative languages. Such languages are more semantically oriented, in that there is no uniform category of 'intransitive subject'; the single argument of some intransitive verbs will pattern in case, agreement, etc. like the agent of transitives (so-called active verbs), while the the single argument of other intransitive verbs will pattern like the object of transitive verbs.In the next stage, some of these languages were then believed to evolve into Ergativeabsolutive languages. In the most advanced stage, some of the ergative languages were believed to evolve into Nominativeaccusative languages.If this theory had been true, it would have been very profound, since it places strict constraints on how languages can evolve. However, as soon as it was put forth, it became immediately clear that this idea is wrong:We know enough about the history of some languages to show that alignment change is not unidirectional. For example, we know that Sanskrit is the ancestor of Hindi, and contrary to the theory, Sanskrit with an accusative alignment evolved into Hindi with a split-ergative alignment. This cannot be doubted, since we have actual texts of the language at most all stages of its evolution. A less certain example is Georgian: Proto-Kartvelian has been reconstructed with an ergative alignment, but modern Georgian has a active-stative alignment, also contrary to the stadialist hypothesis.A bigger problem is that we have reason to believe that human languages have been spoken for something like a quarter million to half a million years (see my answer When did language originate?). If the stadialist hypothesis were true, then all languages would have reached their end state as accusative languages by the time of the first attested languages unless language change itself sped up furiously only in the last 5000 years. We would in other words expect there to be no ergative or active languages at all if language had been evolving at a steady pace over the last quarter million years.Thus the idea that some particular alignment systems of language are more 'primitive' than others is flawed; alignment systems of all types can show up everywhere in any society."

S" I've already discussed some of the features of Georgian that make it unusual: What are the characteristics of the Georgian language? Those structural properties can be summarized as:Exhorbitant consonant clusters, both quantitatively and qualitatively more complex than almost any other language, make simple articulation of the language difficult;The polysynthetic verb morphology with subject and object agreement is complicated, but the way in which specific affixes compete for realization on the verb (see my other answer for details) is highly unusual and counterintuitive from a typological perspective;The system of case assignment, in which the case of the subject changes from one tense to the next (nominative in the present and future, narrative in the aorist, dative in the evidential perfect) is not just conceptually hard to grasp, but it makes language learning difficult because different conjugations of verbs have different patterns, so for each verb you have to learn which of the four major patterns it takes.Some of the most frequent and necessary word forms are not only irregular but also highly counterintuitive, which means you have to learn them early along with the more straightforward parts of the grammar. For example, the verb 'to have' seems like it should be very basic, but you need to know that it takes a dative case subject that agrees with what look like object prefixes, a nominative case object that agree with subject suffixes, and you also need to know whether the possessee is animate or inanimate, because there are two entirely different verbs for 'have' that depend on that fact. Also, these two verbs use different irregular stems in every tense, so they require a lot of memorization.Although the last two centuries has seen a rush of western loan words, the vast majority of Georgian words are still pretty foreign-looking to westerners. And even when Georgians borrow a western word, they often have an indigenous word that is quite opaque: cf. int'ernacionaluri 'international' vs. saertaoriso 'international' (< er-ta oris 'between peoples').So there are a lot of basic structural facts about the language that make it hard to learn even before you think about language pedagogy. But there are other facts about the way the Georgian language is taught and spoken that make it hard:Although the writing system is straightforwardly phonemic, using an alphabet with 33 letters, those letters do not look anything like more familiar Latin, Greek or Cyrillic letters. On top of that, many of the individual letters look very similar, with no less than 8 letters that look vaguely like the numeral '3':  /v/,  /k'/,  /p'/,  /h/,  /q'/,  /p/,  /g/,  /ts/.Very few teachers of the language are nonnative speakers, and this has the implication that when you are first taught the language, you are being taught by people who have solid intuitions about the language, but who never had to learn the language consciously. This means that most teachers of Georgian don't really understand what features of the language are not intuitive for foreigners.Most Georgian language textbooks rely on outdated understandings of linguistic typology and often simply misanalysis of the grammar, and don't do a good job of trying to connect structures in Georgian to more familiar structures in western languages.Perhaps because Georgia was closed off to the outside world until the fall of the Soviet Union, there were historically few resources for people who actually wanted to speak the language. Only recently have major error-free dictionaries and learner's grammars of Georgian become widely available in western languages. For example, one early dictionary mistranslated Georgian saloni as saloon, with the result that Tbilisi is now full of 'beauty saloons':Most Georgians do not have any experience of speaking in their language to foreigners -- because it's spoken by a small number of people, almost all Georgians know three or more languages and they will speak those languages with foreigners. Unlike English speakers, who know they have to speak more slowly and articulate their words more clearly when speaking to nonnative speakers, Georgians have no practice with this, and usually speak to foreigners just as they would to other Georgians. But more than that, it is simply an alien even surreal experience for Georgians, as if your cat began to complain about the quality of TV nowadays. More than once I've begun a conversation in Georgian, only to have the befuddled interlocutor speak back to me in English or Russian or German, such that I have to explicitly explain that I prefer to speak in Georgian. Probably this is also connected to the way the Georgian language is closely linked to Georgian ethnic identity. Foreigners who speak Georgian do not fit the folk-understanding of ethnicity in the Caucasus that Georgians internalize from a young age. Such foreigners cannot be 'placed' and so Georgians do not know how to identify them as in-group or out-group.Georgia is anthropologically speaking a very positive-face culture: the culture prioritizes the needs of individuals to feel belonging to the group rather than individuals' needs for respect of their personal prerogatives and autonomy. The implication for language is that Georgians will speak back to you in a language other than Georgian because they feel they can help you out, rather than respecting your personal choice to use Georgian. Explanation that this is not actually helpful for the Georgian language learner will be met with mystified looks, and they will usually carry on speaking English or Russian or some western language.Finally, most foreigners only come to Georgia after they are well past the critical period (roughly 12-17 years of age) when people can no longer easily acquire new languages -- the brain rewires itself after this point, making second-language acquisition harder. This means, from a cognitive perspective, they simply don't have the same experience of learning Georgian as they would Spanish or German, which can be taught in schools in the west from a young age.Thus in my experience it is a combination of facts internal to the language, and the sociolinguistic context in which it is spoken that make it difficult for foreigners to learn Georgian properly."

S" Far from it.  One problem with this question is that the word 'nation' necessarily implies some form of common ethnic identity, and the great empires of Rome, China and Persia definitely did not have common ethnic identities. Even ignoring this complication though, there were quite a few other major, and dozens of minor, kingdoms, republics and empires around the world, not to mention thousands of tribal societies. Here's just a selection from the eastern hemisphere ca 100 AD:So, to be sure, Rome and China were superpowers, and Persia and to a lesser extent Axum were powers of the middle rank, but there were others that should have their due."

S' Definite articles like the mark noun phrases as identifiable to the reader/hearer. Contrary to some other answers here and what you may have learned in school, it is quite possible for definite noun phrases to be nonspecific, and even nonexistent (or in linguist\'s parlance, nonreferential). Both of these are at play in a sentence like "The unicorn is an imaginary animal". In that sentence, the use of the reflects an entire category of beast which, despite not referring to a specific instance of an animal, is assumed to be identifiable to the hearer (we all read or heard about unicorns as children, even though we\'ve obviously never seen one). An early modern depiction of a unicorn. It is still grammatical to refer to "the unicorn" as a class of animal, even though it does not in fact exist.Different languages with definite articles have different rules of use. Thus in German and Greek, it is quite grammatical to mark proper names with a definite article even though proper names always have unique referents: Die Sabine hab\' ich gestern gesehen. In English and many other languages with definite articles, on the other hand, this is quite ungrammatical: *I saw the John yesterday. So the usage of articles is not determined by the semantic meaning of a phrase, but by the structure of a discourse, and the rules for encoding that discourse are language specific.'

S" An inquorate gender is a gender (or noun class) in a language that is closed, in that new members cannot or cannot easily be added, andhas very few members, generally less than one or two dozen.Maybe the most famous example of inquorate genders comes from the language Tsova-Tush (aka Batsbi). In this language, there are five productive noun genders (five? yes, see my earlier answer: Are there languages that have more than three grammatical genders?) and three genders that have only a small number of nouns. But to see that you first have to understand how gender works in Tsova-Tush. Like other Nakh-Daghestanian languages, verbs agree with the gender of the subject (if intransitive) or object (if transitive), and the agreement depends on the specific combination of markers in the singular and in the plural:Thus, to say 'the boy is', you say k'nat va; but to say 'the boys are', you say k'nati ba. This is because the noun k'nat belongs to the first gender, while other nouns have different patterns of agreement. 'The bear is' and 'the bears are' would thus respectively be a ba and ar da. It is thus the specific combination of exponents -- actual affixes -- that determines which gender any given noun belongs to. The problem with this is that, for the analyst, it seems to be missing a generalization that the last three of these genders, genders VI, VII and VIII, only consist of a small number of nouns -- 25 total for those three combined -- and they might better be listed as lexical exceptions in the grammar."

S' The short answer is no. This is because writing is not merely a means of communication, but rather a visual system that represents the actual properties of spoken human languages.As I explained in a previous answer (When did the oldest written language start as compared to the oldest spoken language?), true writing evolved first among the Sumerians only after a period of pictograph-like signs that represented tokens for trade came to acquire determinatives that represented actual grammatical formatives in speech. As I mentioned in that answer, "the earliest proto-cuneiform signs lacked these properties [of case, number, person, etc]: they were merely signs that represented things in the world such as animals, people and certain abstractions like number and size". As Denise Schmandt-Besserat put it,[B]efore the invention of writing, compositions typically consisted of geometric or animal motifs that were juxtaposed, dovetailed together, orplaced in rotating arrangements that symbolized an idea or evoked a story. But after writing, as the process of copying the dispositions of signs on a tablet was introduced, Near Eastern art became linear and thus could tell a story. [When Writing Met Art]All this is missing in the Gbekli Tepe pictographs. There are clearly pictures of vultures, scorpions and other entities, but these do not constitute writing, at any level, because they merely evoke a narrative that involves vultures and scorpions and do not actually tell what role those vultures and scorpions had. No one doubts that the people who built Gbekli Tepe were anatomically and behaviorally modern (see Behavioral modernity) but writing requires more than that.  Language is not the same as communication, and pictorial representation is not the same as writing.'

S" The short answer is that Georgian and Ossetian belong to totally unrelated language families, use largely unrelated lexicons, and have rather dissimilar grammatical systems.One of the big problems that students of Caucasian languages face is what you might call the Orientalist Fallacy: speakers of Caucasian languages 'over there' have been living next to each other, speaking each other's languages for centuries or millennia, so they must be pretty similar, right? Georgians and Ossetians share many traits in common: marriage customs, culinary traditions, modes of dress, styles of architecture, rules of hospitality (and contrariwise, blood vendettas), and all sorts of other cultural habits, so it is very easy to assume their languages must go along for the ride. Here for example are two old pictures of men in traditional dress, both holding a gun and wearing Chokhas: a western Georgian (on the left) and an Ossetian (on the right) -- can you spot the difference?Superficially, especially from the vantage point of the Moskva River or the Seine, Georgians and Ossetians can seem to be practically identical.Phylogenetic DifferencesBut the first major problem with that view is that, linguistically, Georgian and Ossetian belong to two entirely unrelated language families: Kartvelian and Indo-European (on its Iranian branch), respectively. Although the Kartvelian languages have been situated in the Caucasus since time immemorial (at least the early Bronze Age), the Ossetians arrived there in classical antiquity as an off-shoot of an eastern subbranch of the Iranian family within Indo-European -- Ossetian is specifically most closely related to Yaghnobi, a language spoken in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan. They are in fact the last remnants of the ancient Scythian nomads who roamed the western and central steppe more than two thousand years ago. So despite centuries of geographic proximity, they originally come from totally different parts of Eurasia, which you can see on this map. (Here, Georgia is in the left corner, with the capital labeled 'Tiflis', near the current Ossetic speaking region, while Yagnobi is far to the east near Dushanbe.)Grammatical (In)congruitiesIn many ways, Ossetic has drifted far from its IE origins. Unlike most other IE languages but like Georgian, Ossetic has lost all grammatical genders. Ossetic has also entirely lost its original IE case paradigm system, in which suffixes combined number and case in a single affix. Ossetic has instead innovated an almost entirely new system with a discrete number suffix followed by one of nine case suffixes (again, mostly unknown in IE). Here for example is the paradigm for 'house' (with the Georgian equivalent for comparison):Ossetic Singular PluralNominative xzar xzar-tt- 'house/houses'Genitive xzar-y xzar-tt-y Dative xzar-n xzar-tt-n Allative xzar-ma xzar-tt-amAblative xzar-y xzar-tt-yInessive xzar-y xzar-tt-ySuperessive xzar-yl xzar-tt-ylEquative xzar-aw xzar-tt-aw Comitative xzar-ima xzar-tt-imaGeorgianNominative saxl-i saxl-eb-i 'house/houses'Narrative saxl-ma saxl-eb-maDative saxl-s saxl-eb-sGenitive saxl-is saxl-eb-isInstrumental saxl-it saxl-eb-itAdverbial saxl-ad saxl-eb-adVocative saxl-o saxl-eb-oAs you can see, this, too, somewhat resembles the Georgian system, in that Georgian also lost an original number+case suffix and replaced it with separate number and case suffixes. (Probably in both languages this was due to Turkic influence.) But in most respects, Georgian grammar works entirely differently:In Georgian, verbs inflect for all sorts of categories, including the person and number of subjects, direct and indirect objects, tense, aspect, mood, voice, and even the direction of movement towards the speaker (so-called ventive prefixes). Ossetic verbs in contrast form only a few tenses synthetically, the others using participles.Voice in Georgian is usually synthetic: cf. active da-c'er-a 'he wrote it' vs. passive da-i-c'er-a 'it got written'. In Ossetic, passives are usually formed analytically with a past participle plus an auxiliary that means 'go': arazin 'to build' vs. arazt tsuin 'to be built'.Georgian, like Russian, German, French and other languages, distinguishes between an unmarked en 'you (sg)' and both a plural and polite singular tkven 'y'all/you(polite)'; Ossetic does not use the plural pronoun for politeness.In Georgian, the imperative is always exactly identical to the aorist tense form; in Ossetic, there is a special dedicated imperative form.In Georgian, the subject of some intransitive verbs is marked the same way as the subject of transitive verbs, while the subject of other intransitive verbs is marked the same way as the object of transitive verbs (a so-called Activestative language); in Ossetic, the subjects of intransitive pattern like the subjects of transitives (or a Nominativeaccusative language), just as in most European languages. Georgian is sometimes described as an SOV (subject-object-verb) word-order language, but this is a great overstatement. Georgian has a slight tendency towards SOV, though really its order is discourse-configurational (meaning that word order depends on how you want to structure your discourse, not some specific rule) [1]. Other languages in the region such as Daghestanian languages and certainly Ossetic, are much more rigidly SOV-oriented.In other words, while many of the features they share in common are properties that are commonplace around the world (e.g. SOV languages often also have postpositions rather than prepositions), the kinds of unusual features that would point toward some kind of language contact between Georgian and Ossetic come back in the negative. This is even true on the vocabulary level, since a comparison of the 100 most basic words in Georgian and Ossetic (Georgian Swadesh list and Ossetian Swadesh list) shows that they share very few if any words in common -- unexpected if Ossetic and Georgian have been intensively borrowing from each other.So the bottom line is that Georgian and Ossetic are quite different from each other linguistically, both historically and in today's languages.[1] For a geekily technical discussion of Georgian word order, you can read my article published in Lingua: Nonconfigurationality and Argumenthood in Georgian."

S" As I've discussed before (Are there languages that have more than three grammatical genders?), the word gender historically did not refer primarily to biological sex at all, but to a grammatical concept in which words are divided into different classes for purposes of inflection. [1] This is because gender comes from Latin genus, which simply means 'kind' or 'sort'. The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, notes this example from a Middle English grammatical text, ca. 1450:How many thyngis falleth to a noun? Sixe..: qualite, comparison, gendre, noumbre, fygure, and case.Because gender still retains this original meaning of an abstract grammatical category, it is quite reasonable to talk about nouns in a language having multiple genders to refer to nouns that are masculine, feminine, animate, inanimate, rational, irrational, long, short, high, low, round, flat, etc. Most languages in the world do not grammaticalize such concepts as formal categories, but in those that do, it is quite common for a language to have five or more genders, as you can see in this map from WALS:The record comes from the Arapesh language of Papua New Guinea, which has at least nineteen genders in some varieties. (In some traditions of grammar writing, such systems are called noun-class systems, but there is no substantive difference between gender and noun-class as metalinguistic terms.) Now, when we talk about gender as a grammatical category, we are implying that there are rules of the language that depend on that category. This means that there must be some sort of agreement, whether morphological or anaphoric, and not just nouns that refer to specific kinds of thing like queen or policeman. Thus, in English, there are no gender affixes to distinguish masculine from feminine genders, but if you say 'The Queen said he's in trouble' you assume that Prince Philip has mouthed off again, because the Queen couldn't be talking about herself because of the anaphoric agreement between the noun and the pronoun. Thus, contrary to the question, English does have a gender system -- just one that does not function the same way as French or Russian.The Origin of GenderSo, why would languages even have gender in the first place? The answer has to do partly with noise. When people speak to each other, there is almost always something else going on -- birds singing, doors shutting, other people talking -- and languages have developed all sorts of redundancies to vitiate this signal noise. By having formal devices that redundantly cross-reference the subject matter in a sentence, listeners are much less likely to misunderstand what is being said, and so much less likely to misbehave accordingly. Thus, even if the genders were purely formal, in which members did not share any semantic traits at all, gender agreement would still be useful.As for specific languages, it is always necessary to refer to the specific history of grammaticalization in specific languages, and we often do not know enough about that history to be certain why a particular gender system arose. English is an Indo-European language, and we know enough about Proto-Indo-European to believe that at some early stage PIE had two genders, animate and inanimate (a system attested in the earliest language to branch off, Hittite). Later, it developed a set of suffixes specifically for feminine entities, thus producing the classical three-way masculine~feminine~neuter split seen in languages like Latin, Greek, Sanskrit and German. So, why did PIE have an animate~inanimate contrast in the first place? We just don't know, since we don't know enough about how Indo-European relates to other language families to make even good guesses about this aspect of its grammar.In the case of English, we inherited a three-way gender system from Indo-European via Proto-Germanic, which like continental languages was formal: Old English man 'man' was masculine because it agreed with the article se 'the (masc.)', while wifman 'woman' was also masculine in gender, because it also agreed with se and not with feminine so or neuter t. Because in English most of these agreement patterns were borne by affixes in rather convoluted case-number paradigms, even a small unrelated sound change like the loss of final vowels could upend the entire system, and this is exactly what happened. In many languages, this would have led to the loss of gender entirely, but because English preserved gender contrasts in pronouns, the system was changed from a formally defined morphological gender system to a wholly semantically defined anaphoric gender system. The bottom line: gender refers to categories of words, not biological sex, and serves a functional purpose in the languages that possess it.[1] Although 'gender' has been used since the Middle Ages to refer to men and women viewed as kinds of groups, the sociological concept of gender as the cultural differences that distinguish men from women did not arise until the mid 20th century."

S' These are two very different questions. For the first, there is a (somewhat) clear answer; for the second, there is no answer because the question relies on the false assumption that spoken languages can have a certain age.Writing is not just symbolism...The earliest form of (proto-)writing comes from Mesopotamia, and did not burst into existence full-fledged, but evolved over a period of many centuries from earlier forms of pictographic and symbolic communication systems. The best work on this was done by the art historian Denise Schmandt-Besserat, who showed in a series of engaging works that writing arose in Mesopotamia as a by-product of accounting systems. These early accounting systems used physical tokens to keep track of goods and services, often rather abstract ones like spheres and cones:(From her work When Writing Met Art)Over time, to increase the security of transactions, these tokens were kept in clay envelopes, which when broken revealed the contents of the deal. Later, these envelopes were stamped with indications of the contents. It was eventually realized that these stamps could in fact entirely replace the tokens inside, and proto-writing was born. [1]However, such pictographic systems differ from true writing systems in that true writing systems reflect actual features of spoken language, including aspects of word-order, case-marking, verb agreement and other aspects of natural languages that do not exist in other symbolic communication systems. The earliest proto-cuneiform signs lacked these properties: they were merely signs that represented things in the world such as animals, people and certain abstractions like number and size. As Schmandt-Besserat put it,[B]efore the invention of writing, compositions typically consisted of geometric or animal motifs that were juxtaposed, dovetailed together, orplaced in rotating arrangements that symbolized an idea or evoked a story. But after writing, as the process of copying the dispositions of signs on a tablet was introduced, Near Eastern art became linear and thus could tell a story. [When Writing Met Art]An example of this is the Kish Tablet, found in the Sumerian city of Kish and dated to ca. 3500 BC:The Kish TabletOn this tablet, there is only an evocation of a narrative (of some kind); there is no true telling of that narrative, since there is no way to relate signs to fully inflected spoken words. It was only some centuries after this that cuneiform became unequivocally a form of writing, in the Jemdet Nasr period ca. 3200 BC. Proto-hieroglyphic forms of Egyptian started to be attested around the same time, 3100 BC. ...and Not the Same as LanguageWriting is different from spoken language in many ways. First, spoken language is an evolved feature of the human species: there are no humans that do not speak in some kind of language. Humans appear to be genetically programmed to acquire language, and all humans will do so automatically without training as long as they are exposed to speech before the onset of puberty. Writing is different, in that humans have to be trained to use writing in the same way that they have to be trained to look both ways before crossing the street, or trained how to use a knife and fork to eat. It is in other words a qualitatively different kind of cultural practice.Rather than just some skill we acquire like learning to tie our shoelaces, a better way to think about spoken language is as a biological trait that has been characteristic of humans for hundreds of thousands of years. As with biological species, it is not sensible to ask when a particular language evolved, because all languages have evolved continuously for an equally long time from the first proto-language that came into being perhaps some quarter-million years ago (see my answer: When did language originate?). And indeed: this first proto-language harkens back to even earlier pre-linguistic forms of communication similar to those used by other species of ape. There has thus never been any one point in time when a given language categorically changed from Language A to Language B: linguistic change is not discrete like that.However, if we must compare the ages of writing and of speech, then something like the modern human language faculty has been in use for far, far longer than writing: 99% of the time speech has been around, writing has not.[1] In some places, other motives than economics might have been at work. The oracle bone scripts of China, for example, while not examples of true writing, probably had primarily or exclusively religious usages at first.'

S" There are a number of misconceptions in this question, and in some of the other answers here. This is because ergativity refers to a pattern of alignment in language, and is not a property of particular nominal or verb forms as such:What we mean by alignment is that the individual arguments of clauses are usually marked in some way to indicate who is acting, or who did what to whom. In intransitive clauses, there is only one actant, but in transitive clauses there are two or more actants, and usually the single argument of an intransitive clause will be marked for a given feature (person, number, gender, etc.) in the same way as one of the arguments of the transitive clause. (This is true of by far the most common alignment types, nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive systems, though not of course for the other three rarer alignment patterns.)In some languages, ergative marking will show up on both nouns and verbs. This is true of Daghestanian languages, most of which mark the noun for ergative or absolutive case, and the verb for agreement with the absolutive argument in number and gender. For example, in the Hinuq language (a Tsezic language of Daghestan), the nominal subjects of transitive verbs receive a special ergative case suffix, while intransitive subject nouns and transitive object nouns are unmarked (= absolutive case). Some verbs agree in gender and number with the non-ergative argument:(Taken from work by Diana Forker)In other languages, only the verb will indicate the ergative pattern. This is true of Abkhaz, which does not have cases, but does have verbs that agree with subjects, direct objects and indirect objects:(Taken from Hewitt 2005)This table shows the Abkhaz-Abaza verb agreement prefixes. The prefixes in column I show how verbs agree with either an intransitive subject or a transitive direct object, while column III shows how the verb agrees with transitive subjects. Because in Abkhaz there are not any grammatical cases to speak of, the ergative pattern is visible only in the verb agreement system. Such systems are somewhat rarer than ergativity reflected in nominal case. Compare the two following WALS maps: Alignment of verb agreement Alignment of nominal caseAs you can see, a number of languages have ergative case marking systems but nominative-accusative alignment for their verb agreement -- but not all. These kinds of incongruities illustrate the larger point that alignment types like ergativity are patterns of constructions, not patterns of whole languages, and not something inherent in particular morphological affixes.Works Cited:Hewitt, G. 2005.

S' This is really a huge question -- individual linguists have devoted their entire careers to examining how reflexivity works in natural languages because the subject is astonishingly complex. But because the question asks how reflexivity is \'shown\', I take it that what they\'re looking at is how reflexivity is formally encoded across languages. There are very generally speaking two different ways: the use of a special reflexive pronoun or noun, or the use of a special suffix on the verb to indicate coreference between the subject and an object. Within the class of nominals, there are two subtypes: SE-reflexives, and SELF-reflexives (for more on which, see below). Not all languages have all types (indeed, most don\'t). In many languages reflexives of any type are also homophonous with reciprocals. This is especially true of many languages of North and South America as well as Australia and some parts of Africa: WALS map on reciprocals(Taken from work done by Ekkehard Koenig.)Reflexive PronounsReflexive pronouns are the most familiar to us, since they are used in not just English, but also most European languages and indeed most languages generally. Thus we see construction like the following:(1) German Der Mann hat sich im Spiegel gesehen. the.MASC.NOM man has REFL in.the mirror see.PAST.PART \'The man saw himself in the mirror.\'(2) Georgian K\'ac-ma tav-i sark\'e-i nax-a man-NARR self-NOM mirror-in see.PF-AOR.3sg \'The man saw himself in the mirror.\'(3) Telugu Kamala tana-ni tanu eppuDuu poguDu-kon-Tun-di  Kamala.NOM SELF-ACC SELF-NOM always praise-REFL-PROG-AGR Kamala always praises herself.As mentioned above, in some languages there is a contrast between a simpler SE-type reflexive and a more complex SELF-type reflexive. In general, if a language has pronominal intensifiers, it will be identical to the SELF-type reflexive, not the SE-type. Dutch is maybe the most famous example of a language with such a distinction:(4) a. Jan waste zich.  John washed SE  b. Jan waste zichzelf.  John washed SELF  Both: John washed himself. (5) a. *Jan haatte zich.  John hated SE  b. Jan haatte zichzelf  John hated SELF  John hated himself. Other languages that have a SE/SELF distinction are German, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Greek, and Georgian. Although research on such anaphors is still evolving, it appears to be the case that if a language allows long-distance anaphors, the SELF-type pronoun will be used in the most local clause, while the SE-type pronoun could be used further away from the noun it is coreferential with:(6) Jn-1 skipai Ptri a raka ??sjlfan sig-1/sig-1/hann-1  hverjum degi.  John ordered Peter to shave SELF/SE/him on every day John-1 ordered Peter to shave him-1 every day.Here, the \'him\' is actually John, but in Icelandic you can use the SE-reflexive there, which in English would be ungrammatical unless you meant Peter: *"John-1 ordered Peter to shave himself-1 every day.\'Verbal ReflexivesOther languages sometimes have suffixes on the verb that carry the weight of the reflexive. Russian is such a language, as you can add the clitic -sya to reflexivize the verb instead of using the reflexive pronoun:(7)    On poranil sebya He wounded himself(8)   On poranilsya He wounded-selfIn Russian this suffix is just a clitic that attaches to the very end of the verb. In other languages such as Georgian or Meskwaki (an Algonquian language spoken in Iowa) the reflexive suffix is more tightly attached to the verb:(9) Georgian: K\'ac-ma da-i-nax-a sark\'e-i Man-NARR PVB-REFL-see.PF-AOR.3sg mirror-in \'The man saw himself in the mirror.\'(10) Meskwaki (Algonquian) a. wa:pa-tiso-w-a look.at-REFL-3-3anim \'He looked at himself\' b. wa:pat-am-w-a o-wiyawi look.at-TH-3-3anim 3Poss-body \'He looked at himself.\'As you can see from all of these, languages have a variety of different strategies to represent reflexivity, most of which are not mutually exclusive.Works Cited:Koenig, Ekkehard and Claire Moyse-Faurie. \'Towards a Typology of Reflexivity\' Handout available online: Page on eva.mpg.deFischer, Silke. \'Pronominal anaphora\' Available at: Page on ifla.uni-stuttgart.de'

S" To get at that, you have to go back a step to answer why genders systems arise in the first place. I've already answered this in other answers:Are there languages that have more than three grammatical genders? What determines the gender of newly invented nouns? Is there any language with gendered pronouns for second person? The short answer is that linguistic gender is not a reflection of biology but simply a way to divide the world up into categories so that you can keep track of pieces of information. Most languages have no gender at all, but even for those that do, having gender in pronouns is just one option. Here e.g. is a WALS map of languages with gender in pronouns:As you can see, most languages in East Asia, North America, South America and some parts of Africa lack gender distinctions in pronouns. This is a case where the fact that European languages are so widely used fools us into thinking that they are the norm, when in fact they are not."

S" Without knowing anything about the biology and anatomy of the creatures who would speak such an alien language, it is really impossible to say anything specifically. Necessary and Unnecessary PropertiesHowever, there are a few types of things that we could say more generally about what is necessary in any language. These boil down to two things:a recombinant symbolic system to represent semantic content, andsome method of conveyance of that information to other 'speakers'All known human languages have a number of other features not found in other animal communications systems (see my previous answer to Is there anything that linguists have found that is in all languages?), but an alien species on another planet could easily lack one or more of these properties:An alien language might well not use a vocal-auditory system to propagate its message, but rather use emission of light or chemical trails.An alien language that does not use sound might also lack transitoriness, since a chemical trail might be (more or less) permanent.An alien language might be hard-coded into their DNA (or whatever similar genetic analogue), and so lack traditional transmission in the form of learned culture. The implication of this is that the language of an entire species would change very, very slowly -- only as quickly as genetic drift or natural selection would allow. It would also mean that members of this species could not hope to understand variant forms of the language (dialects or other languages) spoken by genetically distant members of their species.An alien language that lacked specialization would only be used in contexts when other cultural acts are done -- there would be no such thing as small-talk.But who's really the alien?And so on. Maybe another way about thinking about this question though is to ask what human languages are already, in the light of linguistic typology, the most strange. Fortunately, this has already been done for us: The weirdest languages. If we abandon our anglocentric bias, it turns out that a number of languages of Europe are listed in the top 25 strangest languages of the world, in comparison to crosslinguistic trends of languages as a whole: The Top 25 Weirdest LanguagesBasically what these people did here was analyze which features were most frequent in the languages of the world -- e.g. SOV word order, or using a question particle to form questions -- and inverted the scale to identify languages with the largest number of infrequent properties. They then assigned languages a weirdness index based on these properties. The top ten weird languages are:Thus a language as familiar as German is actually quite strange, e.g. it has different basic word orders in matrix and subordinate clauses, and uses two different systems of case declension for definite and indefinite noun phrases. English is only a little bit less weird, as it ranks as the 33rd weirdest language in the sample. As Tyler Schnoebelen explains, Part of this is to say that some of the languages you take for granted as being normal (like English, Spanish, or German) consistently do things differently than most of the other languages in the world. It reminds me of one of the basic questions in psychology: to what extent can we generalize from research studies based on university students who are, as Joseph Henrich and his colleagues argue, Western Educated Industrialized Rich and Democratic. In other words: sometimes the input is WEIRD and you need to ask yourself how that changes things.In other words, it is quite possible that you are the alien when it comes to linguistic weirdness."

S' If depends on how you do the counting. In some languages with alphabets, like English, French and German, digraphs and trigraphs are not counted toward the total number of letters in the alphabet. English has a total of 36-37 phonemes in most dialects -- 24 consonants and 12 or 13 vowels -- but has to make do with a measly 26 letters to represent those distinctive sounds graphically. In other languages, such as Spanish, digraphs are actually treated as distinct letters and words are alphabetized accordingly: a word that begins with <ch> goes toward the end of the dictionary in Spanish, not the beginning, as in English. So, if we include these latter kinds of languages, then surely Abkhaz beats most languages: it has a total of 58 phonemes in the literary language, and uses a variant of the Cyrillic alphabet with 64 letters.As you can see, like Spanish, Abkhaz systematically uses digraphs to represent particular phonetic properties: the schwa makes the preceding graph labialized, while the soft sign  indicates a palatalized consonant. These additional diacritic characters are essential to Abkhaz writing because of how many different distinctions in the sound-system are reliant upon it. Like Spanish, these digraphs are also alphabetized differently than the letters separately. Even without these digraphs, Abkhaz has some 41 letters, more than most written languages.Abkhaz is a language that has a fairly serious amount of writing in it. However there might be one language that beats Abkhaz -- the Taa language of Botswana and Namibia. This click language has been estimated to have as many as 87 consonant phonemes, 20 vowel phonemes, and two tones. Linguists argue about how many of these are actually consonant clusters, but few doubt that it is the language with the largest phoneme inventory in the world. Despite this, most Taa speakers are not literate in their own language, and there is no tradition of using a practical orthography for writing Taa, so it is not clear that Taa actually beats Abkhaz in the number of letters in a writing system.'

S" There probably is some truth to this claim, but it mostly boils down to what dialect of a language you've been most exposed to. The dialects of colonial languages that formed in the Western Hemisphere in the last 400-500 years have a few things in common:They were not drawn from a single source dialect in their respective mother-countries, but rather from a large variety of different, sometimes only partially intelligible dialects. This resulted in Koineization, or flattening out, of the differences between dialects that resulted from a linguistic bottleneck:Here, a linguistic bottleneck is analogous to a biological genetic bottleneck: a speciation event occurs (such as migration) that results in a smaller set of features (here, features of a dialect) than in the original population. This new subset is not necessarily 'simpler' (as in the chart), just less diverse.In comparison to their mother countries, these dialect regions were all formed very very quickly: it took a mere 250 years for English to spread from Virginia to California. Compare that to the British Isles, where English did not really begin to replace Celtic languages in Scotland and Ireland for more 800-1000 years after it first showed up there.A corollary of that is that these dialect regions are very big: English across most of North America, Spanish all the way from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego, Portuguese from the Atlantic almost to the Andes. This all means that it is less necessary to adjust multimedia broadcasts for local differences than it would be in any of the mother countries.These three facts have the result that the internal markets of these speaker communities are both vaster and more uniform than any of the other regions across the pond. As a consequence, more people learning Spanish, Portuguese or English are exposed to these new dialects than to their Old World varieties for simple economic reasons. It has nothing to do with the inherent properties of the dialects in question; only the amount of internal diversity."

S' I\'m going to plunk for a slightly different answer than the one Kevin Flint chose: not the first person who left Africa, but the most recent common ancestors of us all, Y-chromosomal Adam and Mitochondrial Eve. These are of course not the Biblical Adam and Eve, but two real human individuals from whom all modern humans descend, who lived between 200k and 350k years ago.The reason I don\'t think the actual migration is so important is that members of the genus Homo have left Africa several times in the last 2 million years (the first left evidence in the Republic of Georgia 1.77m years ago). Even anatomically modern humans have probably gone back and forth across the Africa-Asia divide countless times, so I think the criterion of "the first person who started off for Asia" is not one that singles out a unique individual, or at least not one that we can actually identify. Here for example is a photograph I personally took of the archaeological site in Dmanisi, Republic of Georgia, where they found an astounding five Homo erectus skulls, the most ever found at one site:(Pit in Dmanisi where the H. erectus skulls were found. The layer where they found it is in the exact middle of this photo where you can still animal bones spilling out of the excavation layer.)A more impressive idea for me is the Y-chromosomal Adam, from whom all modern men are descended. Or the Mitochondrial Eve, from whom all men and women are descended. Both of these individuals lived around 200k-350k years ago, and they engaged in a lifestyle that was not noticeably different from their forebears hundreds of millennia before, and their descendents for thousands of years afterward. They had mastery of fire and tool-use and, I would assert, something resembling modern language (with open-ended lexicons and potentially hierarchical syntax -- see my answer to When did language originate?). But they did not as far as we can tell engage in fishing, create composite tools, make figurative art on cave walls or decorate their bodies, or have regionally distinctive cultures of artifact creation -- they were not, in other words, behaviorally modern (Behavioral modernity). In many ways, these two individuals would be very foreign to us -- they would resemble us perfectly in a physical sense, but their behaviors would be difficult to recognize. They probably did not know each other -- they almost certainly did not live at the same time -- but they are literally part of every man, woman and child in (pre)history. From this they have achieved a kind of immortality that no one human has ever achieved, or is likely to in the future.'

S" So many misconceptions in this question.First, Armenians do not descend from a man named Hayk -- this is an example of the eponymous founder fallacy. This fallacy takes the following form: you have a name, and you don't know where it comes from. So (usually following some kooky Biblical narrative or Greek myth) you simply assert that the name of the country comes from a single man. This was a very common fallacy in etymology in ancient times: it is found repeatedly in the Bible (Israel being the name of a man), Rome (Romulus is transparently the name of the city 'Roma' with a diminutive suffix -ul-), the Armenians from Hayk (Hay- is the Armenian word for Armenian plus a suffix -k) [1], Georgia (the region of Kartli was attributed in the Middle Ages to a man named Kartlos, obviously a Hellenized version of Kartli), and so forth. No one has taken these kinds of explanations seriously for literally hundreds of years, so it's kinda crazy to be reading them on Quora.Second, it is only sort-of true that Armenians are autochthonous to the land they now inhabit (in the sense that they've been there since records began). As I discussed in another answer (Is it true that Armenians invented wine?), here is the true story behind the Armenians:The Armenians are demonstrably an Indo-European people who speak an Indo-European language. They are on their own branch, but they are still obviously related to Greek, German, Latin, Sanskrit, etc.Written historical records of the land that is now Armenia and eastern Turkey goes back thousands of years to almost the beginning of writing. These inscriptions demonstrate conclusively that the earliest inhabitants of eastern Anatolia for whom records exist were not Armenians, but non-Indo-European peoples called the Hurrians and Urarteans (specifically the latter, though the groups were adjacent).After the end of the Bronze Age, when civilizations across the ancient Near East were collapsing, groups of Indo-European tribes from the Balkans began to migrate into Anatolia, including the Phrygians and Armenians. These groups conquered or replaced earlier groups including both Indo-European groups like the Hittites as well as non-Indo-European groups like the Hurrians, Urarteans, Hattites, etc.This process probably began around 1200 BC, with the Phrygians settling in central Anatolia near modern Ankara, while the closely related Armenians kept moving further east and south, where they occupied Urartean cities like Yerevan (whose Urartean name was Erebuni) finally only around 600 BC or so. (An image of Erebuni Fortress, now a suburb of modern Yerevan)The Armenians replaced the Urarteans, though we know few details about how. Obviously there was some language contact: a few names stayed on like Urartu, an alternate form of Mt. Ararat. The Armenians also adopted a few dozen words from Urartean. Over the centuries, the territories controlled by ethnic Armenians have waxed and waned -- the map in the question is certainly misleading, since it includes only territories controlled by Armenians at the height of their power under King Tigranes the Great. For most of their history, Armenians have either been variously independent kingdoms, disunited principalities, weak vassals of greater powers or they were outright annexed by those powers (Assyria, the Cimmerians, Phrygia, Media, Persia, Macedon, Rome, Byzantium, the Arabs, the Turks), with no real kingdom or state of their own.BUT, and this is the important point, although they are not truly autochthonous (like say the Georgians to their north) the Armenians have been in Anatolia for over 3000 years, for so long that they are certainly now indigenous to eastern Anatolia and Armenia.As for whether the Armenians peacefully entered Anatolia in 1200 BC, we really have no idea. There is no historical documentation of the Armenians for centuries after their likely entry into the peninsula, just archaeological evidence, and a burn layer does not tell you who burned a city down. Certainly they could have conquered and killed off the previous inhabitants, but we have no evidence of that.In any event, a larger point of course is that whatever the sins of the fathers (= late Bronze Age wandering tribes) might be, that does not justify punishing the sons (early 20th century ethnic Armenians). The crimes committed against the Armenians in 1915, earlier and later, as well as any contemporary land claims ought to be treated separately from whatever ancient history the land might have.[1] Actually the name Hayk may be related to an ethnonym mentioned in Hittite texts: the Hayasa-Azzi. However it is difficult to know if this is their original name, a phonological accident (similar sounding names happen all the time in unrelated languages) or the adoption by Armenians of the name of the land used by the previous inhabitants. An analogy of this last scenario would be Britain, whose inhabitants now mostly speak a Germanic language, English, but whose original inhabitants as far as anyone can tell were Celtic speaking in the earliest attested records. The name was simply adopted by the invaders for themselves, even though they had nothing to do with the original inhabitants. Something like this definitely did happen to the Hittites: they called themselves Nesites, but the previous occupants of the land were Hattites, and the Hittites' kingdom of Hatti was named after them."

S" That's because when Rome withdrew its legions from a territory, it didn't always withdraw the Latin-speaking colonies it had settled there beforehand. Although there are still fierce disputes within Balkan linguistics about exactly what relationship the modern Romanians have the ancient Latin colonies in the Balkans, what is totally clear is that most of Romania was within the uppermost limit of Romanization south of the Carpathian mountains ca. the 6th century:As you can see, in the 6th century, an entire swath of territory stretching from the Adriatic to the Black Seas and from the Carpathians to the Danube had already become Latin speaking. Later, the creation of a distinct 'Romanian' ethnolinguistic group arose because waves of Slavs, Hungarians, Turks and even Aryans (related to the Ossetians) invaded the Balkans and assimilated parts of the Romance-speaking world to their own languages, and cut them off from each other. Thus the Romanians are the remnant of a once much larger Eastern Romance linguistic sphere.There is another point to be made here though, and this is that when we say a language is a Germanic language or a Romance language, we are not talking about properties the language has today, but rather about the historical evolution of that language. No matter how much Romanian changes in the future, Romanian will always remain a Romance language because it began as a dialect of Latin."

S" As Mark Mandel says, the question is not one that can be answered discretely because there is no discrete number at which one speaks 'many' languages. This is because the word 'many' is rather vague: it constitutes an example of the Sorites paradox ('how many grains of sand do you need to pile up until you have a heap?'):(An image of a heap of grains of sand: where does the heap begin?)But there is another reason, and this is that what constitutes many languages in one culture might be rather few languages in another culture. As I noted in a previous answer, in the Vaupes region of the Amazon, knowing five or more languages is actually a must, since you can only get married to someone who speaks a different language: How many languages is too many for a small child to be learning at once? In such a culture, knowing only three languages would not make people think you are particularly polyglottal."

S' The answer is tricky, because it involves piecing apart two different sources of this construction in American English. That\'s because in addition to Yiddish, this construction also exists in standard German, of which Yiddish is more or less a nonstandard dialect. Here\'s a screenshot of Google autocomplete if you put in "du willst dass ich soll", a literal (and in German grammatical) translation of "you want that I should":In other words, it immediately comes up with other sentences that German speakers search for in modern German. The problem with the Yiddish theory becomes, then, that at exactly the same time that Yiddish speakers were beginning to enter the United States in large numbers (mostly from eastern European territories of the Russian, Austrian and German empires), an even larger number of non-Jewish Germans were also entering the United States:In point of fact, Germans had already been immigrating in larger numbers since the 1840s. Germans and Yiddish-speaking Jews did not always immigrate in the same way; Jews often ended up staying in large cities, while Germans often moved on inland and became farmers or lived in smaller towns. So if we do a historical search for the rise and fall of this construction, what do we find? It turns out that the construction appears to be rare or nonexistent before the 1840s, and rises right when German immigration to the US begins to rise:(This is a search specifically for texts of American English -- the construction is much rarer in British English, though not nonexistent, and follows roughly the same pattern.) The answer appears to be that the construction already existed in American English before the large-scale immigration of eastern European Jews in the last two decades of the 19th century. This is not proof that standard German is actually the source of the construction, but is suggestive. Here\'s a possible scenario:  the construction is introduced by non-Jewish Germans in the early to mid 19th century, most of whom move off inland to become farmers and small-town dwellers in the Midwest. Then, later, German Jews speaking Yiddish start arriving in the 1880s and 1890s, and they also use this construction in their English. However, the Yiddish-speaking Jews tend to stay in urban environments on the East Coast, unlike their gentile fellow German speakers. Then, Yiddish speakers begin to be integrated into non-Jewish society at exactly the time that major multimedia corporations are beginning to shape our reading and buying habits in the early 20th century, and voila: a stereotype is born. It is forgotten that the very first immigrants to use this construction were in fact not Jewish at all.Whether this scenario is really true would involve a little extra digging, which maybe I could do sometime.'

S" Joseph Boyle's answer is basically right: some regions of the world have geographical features, such as mountains, river or dense forests, that disfavor communication over long distances. Because communication is more limited in such places, there is less chance that the form of language used will spread or influence other neighboring languages or dialects. Such regions become residual zones, with linguistic diversity increasing faster than language death and language replacement can decrease it.But it is actually possible to be more specific about the relationship between the location of linguistic communities in the Caucasus and the region's geography. This is because some of the topography is not uniformly mountainous across the region: in some places the mountains form complicated alpine valleys for hundreds of kilometers in every direction, while in other places the mountains are effectively sheer walls that directly abut wide open plains and valleys. To see this, consider the following topographical map of the Caucasus:As you can see, the region is characterized not by one but two large chains of mountains which run roughly parallel to each other: the Lesser Caucasus mountain chain, which largely separates Georgian from Armenia and eastern Turkey; and the Greater Caucasus mountain chain, which separates Georgia and Azerbaijan from Circassia, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Chechnya and Daghestan, among other regions in the southern Russian Federation. These two chains however are rather unlike each other, however, as the Lesser Caucasus mountain chain is over all less elevated, and tends to form discontinuous ridges without sharp increases in elevation. The same is not true of the southern slopes of the Greater Caucasus, which almost constitute a natural wall of rock all the way from subtropical Abkhazia in the west to the Iron Gates (Gates of Alexander) in Azerbaijan in the east. Here for example is an image of the plains of Kakheti in Georgia, just south of Daghestan in Georgia: The town of Sinai shown here is actually on one ridge on the other side of a wide valley about 20km from the mountains, which rise from about 700m above sea level very suddenly to about 3000-5000m above sealevel, and in most places are totally impassable except by foot or on horseback (and usually not even then). Now when you compare this to the geography north of these mountains, you can see from the map that the narrow alpine valleys extend for hundreds of miles north of this sudden wall of mountains. Here for example is the village where the Archi language is spoken: (photo by Marina Chumakina: archi_webpage)As you can see, there are only narrow slices of land where human habitations is even possible; in most places, land is only suitable for the rearing of sheep, cattle and other ruminants, and virtually no large-scale agriculture is possible. This kind of topography slopes slowly northward almost all the way to Astrakhan. Putting all these facts together, now compare a map of Caucasian languages: (From: Atlas of the Caucasian languages: Contents)In each of the places in this map where you see a number, a different language is spoken (and in some cases, actually more than one language, since some dialect continua like Dargwa are actually multiple languages). What is striking is how most of the diversity is precisely in the aforementioned regions where the topography is most unsuitable to human habitation. Essentially large conurbations are not possible in these regions, leading historically to population pressures and fissuring of communities. But this also leads to a great movement among populations depending on seasonal fluctuations in pasturage, with the result that pastoral communities high in the mountains often speak all the languages at lower elevations, leading to what Johanna Nichols has termed vertical polylingualism: Archi speakers will often speak Lak and Avar (in addition to Russian), while Lak speakers won't speak Archi, but they will speak Avar (and Russian). You can see this in more detail here:In other regions, like the plains of Mingrelia (Samegrelo) in western Georgia, Kakheti, Kartli or most of Azerbaijan, the topography is relatively flat and, if close enough to mountain sources of water, then good land for agriculture (especially wine, which was invented in this region some 8000 years ago). These lands have historically functioned sociolinguistically more like spread zones, as the language spoken here has shifted a number of times over recorded history.Thus the bottom line is that a large number of languages have developed in the Caucasus because the topography for most of history disfavored all but the most adventurous of movement and with it communication."

S' First of all, you\'re overgeneralizing how often Americans think about the world outside America. Just compare the American edition of Time magazine with the versions intended for foreign consumption:(from 19 Puzzling Differences Between "Time" Magazine U.S. And International Covers)To a certain extent, this is just a reflection of the sheer size of America: it has the third largest population of any country in the fourth largest landmass with a staggering amount of wealth that sometimes amounts to sybaritic opulence (First World Problems). This combination of size, population and wealth means that America can be in some sense a world unto itself. It is thus not so much that Americans think they are so great; rather, they are just much less dependent on the rest of the world than virtually any other country, and this gives them a kind of self-confidence in the correctness and propriety of their civilization that other countries that are historically or currently more insecure do not have.But there is another reason, and this is that, in comparison to most other major countries of the world, for most of the last several centuries, so much has gone right in America. We have had our share of historical tragedies: the murder and marginalization of Native Americans, African slavery, a racial caste system that still stains our consciousness. But most other major countries have had much, much more violent histories:France had Wars of Religion in the late 16th century that killed between two and four million people. Later, their eponymous revolution killed a quarter million people, about 40 thousand of which were mechanically beheaded in the Reign of Terror in the pursuit of a rigidly idealistic ideology, but most died as a result of economic dislocation and famine. This was immediately followed by an imperial despotism (Napoleon) that killed some six million Europeans over nearly a quarter century of warfare. Later, in the 20th century, France suffered horribly in the First and Second World Wars, which between them killed nearly two million Frenchmen.  an illustration of St. Bartholomew\'s Day massacre (1572)Germany\'s early modern experience was in many ways more awful than almost any place on earth, as it was in some sense the cockpit of Europe. The Thirty Years\' War killed on average 30% of its population (and in some places much much higher), and it was followed by half a dozen world wars fought partly or mainly in Germany: the War of the Spanish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession , the Seven Years\' War , the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic Wars and World Wars I and II. This last war of course also involved a totalitarian regime that pursued the historically shocking systematic murder of millions of eastern European Jews, Slavs, gypsies, mentally handicapped, homosexuals and other \'undesirables\'. And, all these wars combined killed approximately 15-20 million Germans alone, not including the other countries.  Marauding Soldiers (during the Thirty Years\' War)Russia during much of the early modern period managed to stay clear of most of the wars of western Europe, though its frequent wars with the Swedes and the Turks were often very bloody affairs. Starting in the mid 18th century, Russia increasingly became involved in European affairs, especially during the Great Northern War, the War of the Polish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years\' War, the Napoleonic Wars, various 19th century wars in Central Asia during its imperial expansion, and of course the First and Second World Wars. The first of these killed so many people -- at least 3 million -- that the Empire collapsed into civil war and revolution, which killed a further 5-9 million people. After the Communists secured power, they pursued policies in the Ukraine during collectivization that killed at least 3 and as many as 8 million people, mostly from a government-sponsored famine (Holodomor). Then, as Joseph Stalin gained ever more power, he engaged in a series of ever bloodier purges that killed some 700 thousand people during the Great Purge alone. Then, right when the Soviet Union was weak and disorganized because of the purges, Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, and Russia\'s entry into the Second World War left some 25-30 million people dead.  Stalin and Yezhov, before the Purge  Stalin, with Yezhov \'erased\' after the PurgeIn China, the collapse of the Ming Dynasty in the mid 17th century has sometimes been characterized as the \'Ming-Qing Cataclysm\', since over a half century of warfare an estimated 20 million people died. Two centuries later, the Taiping Rebellion killed another 20-25 million people, and immediately after this came to an end, the Dungan Revolt flared up, which killed another 8-12 million people. China managed to avoid the worst in the First World War, but as the Chinese Republic descended into anarchy and warlordism, civil war broke out between the Republican forces and the Communists. Between 1928 and 1949, an estimated 8 million people died as a result of just the civil war. This is of course not to mention the 15-20 million additional people who died during the Second World War fighting the Japanese (during which the Communists and Republicans called a truce). After the Communists secured victory, they instituted policies that lead to the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, which between them killed a staggering 45-60 million people (mostly from famine, though at least one million landlords were executed during the Cultural Revolution).  a scene during the Taiping RebellionSo you can see from this sad litany of historical tragedies and human suffering that America\'s history stands in a wider global context. In that context, the bloodiest war in America\'s history, the Civil War, killed a comparatively small 700 thousand people. Because Americans have lead relatively peaceful lives over the last 400 years, they were able to engage in, as Thomas Jefferson put it, \'the pursuit of happiness\', and institute governments structured around the rule of law and, increasingly, democracy that now the world over are considered the hallmarks of a civilized society. This combination of peace, prosperity and freedom has for many centuries been attractive to people around the world. And Americans know this, because these people have voted with their feet.So you see, it is not that Americans think we are so great. Rather it is that we know that our history could have been so much worse.'

S" As it happens, I've actually been investigating the typology of suppletion recently as part of my research on what the languages of the Caucasus have in common. The definition that Justin Lo gave is good as a first approximation: stems like go and stems like went are indeed historically unrelated to each other (Old English gn and wendan respectively). But there exist many different problems with defining suppletive forms in this way, which might summarize as uncertainty, inadequacy and typology:Uncertainty: etymologies are often disputed or entirely unknown, especially in languages with few historical written materials. Even in English, a word as basic as 'bad' has a poorly understood etymological pedigree.Inadequacy: using a historical explanation of where a word comes from often leads to a spurious understanding of how the word functions in today's language. Typology: we understand the histories of too few languages to have comparable understandings of widely divergent languages.That's all pretty abstract, so to give you a concrete example, both English and German have rather irregular verb forms for 'be' that children simply have to memorize:(1) English German I am we are ich bin wir sind you are you are du bist ihr seid he is they are er ist  sie sindNow here's the problem: although from a modern point of view all of these forms in both languages are irregular and unpredictable, from a historical point of view, the forms in bold (in both English and German) go back to one Proto-Indo-European verb root *es-, while the German forms that are italicized go back to a separate root *bheu-, which is also where English gets the infinitive form be. So if we say that suppletive roots are historically unrelated, we are forced into the position of saying that the irregular English forms are not suppletive (since they go back to the same root), while the equally irregular German forms are suppletive (since they go back to different roots).  A gratuitously geeky comic about suppletionThis seeming paradox can be obviated if we decide instead to use a purely synchronic definition of suppletion: suppletive stems are phonologically maximally unlike each other. This definition presents its own problems, since likeness can be gradient: is children suppletively related to child? However, that really liberates us from forcing grammatical phenomena into our preconceived expectations of how they should behave.So to really answer the question, two languages of the Caucasus are most striking to me in terms both of how frequently they use suppletive forms, but also the relationships these suppletive forms have with each other. The first comes from Georgian, a language with at least as much suppletion as English:Table 1. Georgian suppletive forms (taken from Aronson 1990 and Hewitt 1995)Like English, Georgian often has different stems for different tenses (NB: all these forms are third person singular subject and third singular object.) What's interesting about this system is that often roots are shared not just between some tenses and not others, but also between different verbs. The only difference between 'he will be' and 'he will have it' is not the suppletive stem, but the preradical vowel. In some cases, such as 'say' and 'tell', not only are identical roots used in some tenses of two different verbs and not others, the verb forms themselves might be totally identical in some tenses and not others. This is true of the perfect forms of 'say' and 'tell', and the present forms of carry and 'take something'. But it's even more complicated when you look at the full paradigms of some of these verbs. Consider the future paradigms of 'go away' vs. 'go (about)': SG PL SG PL(2) 1 mi-val  mi-val-t da-v-i-vl-i da-v-i-vl-i-t 2 mi-x-val mi-x-val-t da-i-vl-i da-i-vl-i-t 3 mi-va mi-vl-en da-i-vl-is da-i-vl-ian 'I will go off, you etc.' 'I will go about, you etc.'Here, the root in just one form -- the third person plural of 'go off' -- is used for the entire paradigm of 'go (about)', so that one verb is regular, while another is irregular. Also, like the English example above, all of these roots, in both verbs, are historically related, even though they now are frozen in particular forms in particular parts of the paradigm. What this illustrates is irregularity is a feature of how cells in paradigms relate to each other, not features of particular roots.There is some evidence however that at least some of these suppletive roots are in fact not the same verb (sharing a paradigm) at all. An example from the chart above is the verb 'carry', which has a dative-case subject in the present tense, but a nominative case subject in the future and a narrative case subject in the aorist past tense:(3) a. Ivane-s mi-a-kv-s c'ign-i samk'itxelo-i John-DAT PVB-PRV-have.INAN-3sg carry-NOM reading.room-to 'John is carrying the book into the reading room.' b. Ivane mi-i-t'an-s c'ign-s samk'itxelo-i John.NOM PVB-PRV-carry-3sg book-DAT reading.room-to 'John will carry the book into the reading room.' c. Ivane-m mi-i-t'an-a c'ign-i samk'itxelo-i John-NAR PVB-PRV-carry-AOR3sg book-NOM reading.room-to 'John carried the book into the reading room.'In these examples, you can see that the present tense form with the weird case-array (dative subject, nominative object) is actually based on the word for 'have something inanimate', while the other two tenses actually have both different roots and different case marking (nominative subject and dative object, then narrative subject and nominative object). In fact, some speakers also have a regular paradigm for the root t'an- 'carry' in the present tense as well, so what we might have here is in fact two only partially merged verbs: one (kv-) that is defective and uses the other (t'an-) for its other tenses, and one that is fully formed (t'an-). So although Georgian case marking is totally strange if you compare it to other languages, these forms are strange even in comparison to other Georgian forms. Georgian is an exceptionally complicated language morphologically, but an even more striking example from the Caucasus is Udi, spoken in Azerbaijan and in a few villages in Georgia. In this language, it is no longer easily possible to form new verb roots. To form new verbs, instead you take a noun and then use one of thirty or so light verbs that are bleached of their meaning (much like when English speakers say 'do homework'). The nouns are incorporated into the verb, but are still morphologically distinct from them. What's interesting is that a number of these light verbs have suppletive stems in different tenses:(Udi data take from Harris' Endoclitics and the origins of Udi Morphosyntax; table mine)The implication of this is that, since new verb meanings have to be composed of light verbs, and since some light verbs have suppletive forms, new verbs in this language are indirectly systematically suppletive -- in effect, regularly irregular. This is truely fascinating, and one of the reasons I continue to study the languages of the Caucasus."

S" Yes, though such languages are considerably rarer than languages which have no gender in the first or second person (like English or French), which in turn are rarer than languages which show no gender distinctions in pronouns at all, the overwhelming majority at 70%:  WALS map illustrating gender distinctions in pronounsAfrica is the continent where gender in pronouns is most frequent, and it is also the continent where gender is most frequently found in the first and second person. For example, according to Anna Siewierska citing work done by the Khoisanist Tom Gldemann and colleagues, in the language Korana (a central Khoisan language spoken in South Africa), gender is found in almost all pronouns, the most in any known language:This language has three genders: masculine, feminine and common. It also has three numbers: singular, dual and plural. The only pronouns that do not have common gender are logically enough the first and second persons -- people rarely talk to inanimate objects, and inanimate objects rarely speak up for themselves. (NB that the peculiar character ||' in the third person is a glottalized lateral click, an approximation of which you can hear pronouned here: Click consonant.) Korana is something of an outlier linguistically. However even Korana's system is not as unusual as those few languages which have gender only in the first or second person, and not the third. One such language is the Cushitic language Iraqw, which contrasts gender in the second person, but not the first or third:This statistical rarity may be seen against the larger pattern across languages, that there is a typological scale ranking first and second person over third: 1, 2> 3.

S" Normally when linguists count the number of pronominal distinctions, they are interested in basically three features: person, number and clusivity. (The third might be considered a subclass of the first.) In many languages, pronouns inflect for other features, such as case, gender, alienability, visibility and even geographical elevation (as in some languages of Daghestan) but these are usually not considered central to linguistic theorizing. (For example, Brian Collins' list of case forms is large compared to English or Chinese, but nothing like the list of case-forms for Tabassaran, which has around 50.)As I mentioned elsewhere (Are there languages which in addition to the singular and plural, have a dual number?), the 'empirical maximum' is probably found in the language Lihir of New Ireland, which has three persons, five numbers and a consistent inclusive/exclusive distinction for a total of 19:However, if we do include the other ancillary features that are found in pronouns, then surely the maximum would be found in the languages of Daghestan. To take Tabassaran as an example, each pronoun would be inflected for most of the 53 cases (in the northern dialects) and two numbers, and four or more genders, plus other relative, interrogative, and other demonstrative pronouns, and tacking on correlatives for good measure, the grand total would easily be above a thousand. However, this is probably less a measure of the language and more a measure of the analyst."

S" Depends on whether you want an 'answer' or the real answer. There are probably dozens of languages with one or fewer (yes, or fewer [1]) speakers left, but the problem comes in identifying them. For the most endangered languages often only very inexact information is available. Often by the time you hear that a language has one speaker left, the language has in fact died -- or on the contrary the people who speak it simply moved from one house to another. If you want an actual list, though, the Ethnologue is usually the best, most reliable source for linguistic demographic data: Ethnologue 15 report of nearly extinct languages. According to this list, there are some 516 languages that are classified as 'nearly extinct', though the list is surely different now, since much of the data comes from the '70s and '80s.Given that somewhere between 50% and 90% of the languages of the world will go extinct in the next century, probably a better way to think about language extinction is not just lists, but what can be done to preserve the knowledge within dying languages for future generations:Document and describe endangered languages in all facets of their use;Enact policies and programs that engender stable bilingualism among members of linguistic minority communities. One way you can do this is highlighting real personal stories that show how meaningful linguistic identities are to the people who hold them, like this story of the last speaker of Wukchumni, Marie Wilcox:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...[1] How can a language have fewer than one speaker? To start with, languages usually undergo obsolescence phenomena, changes to their lexicon and grammar, when few speakers regularly speak the language. This can mean that eventually few speakers in a minority community have a full command of the language."

S" The oldest attestation of a form of something that might be called English is the almost unintelligible inscription on the Undley Bracteate, a single-sided golden medal that bore an inscription in Anglo-Frisian Futhorc runes, which dates to the 5th century:The bracteate features an image of a Romulus and Remus being suckled by the she-wolf with an image of a Roman Emperor (probably Constantine the Great). The inscription reads:ggog mg meduThis has been interpreted to mean 'she-wolf' (ggog, presumably imitative of the cry of a wolf) and 'mead for kinsmen' (mg medu), a reference to the bracteate itself being given as a gift. This form of English is so old that it is not even clear if we should call it English, since it was probably manufactured by someone in what is now Denmark and who emigrated to Britain at the very earliest period of Angl0-Saxon settlement around the year 450 or somewhat later. But of course, at this earliest period, there had been no time for Anglo-Saxon speech to diverge from the forms of speech in the 'old country' on the Continent. This is thus somewhat like the equivalent of finding an inscription on a tool that had been left behind by the Pilgrims on the Mayflower."

S" It's not clear which history is 'our' history, but surely the most absurd war ever fought in anyone's history was the Great Emu War, waged between 2 Nov and 10 Dec in 1932 in Western Australia. Whether or not you call this a true 'war' is a matter of opinion, I suppose, as it ranged the forces of the Royal Australian Artillery, armed with machine guns, against, well, actual emus that were running amok in Western Australia. The 'war' came about because approximately 20,000 emus had migrated into marginal lands that had recently been occupied by WWI veterans. The emus were destroying crops and infrastructure through wide sections of the territory, and so the farmers called in the authorities to round up the birds who were clearly becoming a nuisance. Unfortunately, the idea of culling the animals proved more difficult than it first had appeared. As one ornithologist mentioned about the events:The machine-gunners' dreams of point blank fire into serried masses of Emus were soon dissipated. The Emu command had evidently ordered guerrilla tactics, and its unwieldy army soon split up into innumerable small units that made use of the military equipment uneconomic. A crestfallen field force therefore withdrew from the combat area after about a month.Basically, the emus had won.  This lead to a certain amount of grousing in the Australian Parliament and foreign press, and the authorities were forced into spin mode to avoid the implication that they had been defeated by birds with brains the size of an almond:After this first 'war', in succeeding years several other attempts were made to exterminate the problem of emus foraging on farmers' lands, but military tactics never fully solved the problem. It was not until some decades later that individual bounties managed to lessen the rapidly expanding emu population.

S" Joshua Engel definitely gets it right: English is still fundamentally, functionally a Germanic language. I'd just like to add though a more abstract point, and this is that when we say two languages are related to each other, we are making a claim about their historical phylogeny, that in effect at one point the two language communities spoke the same language. We are not in fact necessarily saying anything about their current functioning today -- their lexicon, their grammar -- at all. (For more on this, see my earlier answer: How close are French and English?) In fact, many languages have borrowed an even larger percentage of their lexicon from other languages. Albanian for example has over the centuries borrowed over 90% of its word-hoard (to use a good Anglo-Saxon word) from Greek, Italian, Turkish and other Balkan languages. In the limit, in cases of extreme contact, languages can even effectively borrow their entire lexicon from other languages -- we call these languages pidgins and creoles. [1] In such languages, there will usually be a lexifier language like English or Portuguese which provides the words, while most or all the grammar will be borrowed from some other language.  Map of pidgin and creole languages around the worldThere are even a few cases of so-called mixed languages, where a language will take, say, all nouns from one language, but take its verbs from a completely different language. This is true of the Michif language of Canada, whose nouns come mostly from French, but whose verb system comes from Cree. The result in this language is that nouns have two genders: masculine or feminine gender from French, but a covert animate/inanimate contrast from Cree (because Cree verbs agree in animacy with their arguments). Such languages tell us a lot about how language itself functions.[1] In fact, 'borrowing' may not be the right word to describe pidginization processes, but lexifier languages usually are 'foreign' to a given region."

S" Since 1972, it already has been extinct in the wild, in its original habitat. This was mostly due to poaching. In the last few years up to one thousand individuals have been reintroduced in the Arabian Peninsula, and they are now considered merely vulnerable.However, back in the 1980s, a few hundred Arabian oryxes were imported to Texas, where they now number over ten thousand individuals. The hot dry climate of south and west Texas is highly conducive to these animals, and in some places they are actually becoming an invasive species. Most of these oryxes are on wild game ranches where hunters pay a premium (usually many thousands of dollars) to hunt exotic wild game. This practice is needless to say controversial, but it has been argued that it actually increased the overall size of herds, since ranchers and owners of hunting leases had an incentive to keep herds well-maintained and healthy. Now considerably more oryxes live in Texas than anywhere else in the world. Also as of 2012, the animal has reentered the US government's list of endangered species, meaning that it can no longer be hunted for game. According to Texas Monthly, this has already resulted in dozens of oryxes being sold or slaughtered for wild game hunts: The End of Hunting for Exotic, Endangered Antelopes. A similar plan is afoot to import more than 4% of South Africa's rhinoceroses to Texas where they will not be hunted: As poaching heats up, conservationists advocate sending South Africa rhinos to Texas.For more information on the status of oryxes and other exotic animals in Texas, check out this 60 Minutes episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."

Collin Woodard wrote about these cultural differences in his book American Nations, a history of 11 Rival Regional Cultures of North America. But rather than just tell you to read that (which you should) I'll go with a nonobvious difference that's pretty identifying: language.Despite the fact that America is a pretty young country, and does not have nearly as much linguistic variation as Great Britain, dialectology does a pretty good job of identifying where you're from. Bert Vaux and Josh Katz came up with a great dialect quiz that uses 25 linguistic isoglosses (roughly, dialect features distinctive to particular regions) that, when overlaid each other, gives a pretty accurate assessment of where you grew up (if you stayed in one place anyway). You can take that quiz here, and it will make you a personalized dialect map: The New York TimesIn my case, it guessed pretty closely that I grew up in Texas, though I'm actually from Houston not the Dallas-Fort Worth area:Actually, Houston dialect is kinda a mix of upper Southern and Deep Southern -- it stands right at the border -- so it's not surprising that the algorithm would identify some Deep Southern aspects of my speech, though no one would guess I'm even from the South based on the way I talk."

S' English is pretty tame when it comes to morphology. The oddest exceptions in forming plurals are hyperliterate Greco-Latin foreign loan words like octopodes [1], rhinocerotes, and chrysalides, all of which have alternative (nonpretensious) Anglo-Saxon plurals. However, even these forms are actually not all that uncommon, since at least half the languages of the world indicate nominal plurals by suffixation: WALS map indicating pluralization strategies around the worldSome constructions that seem odd to speakers of European languages -- such as a separate word to indicate plurality -- are in fact not so rare either. Some constructions however are truly unusual, such as systematically using tone to indicate noun plurals, which is found in the Sudanic language Ngiti:(1) Ngiti: kam chief  km chiefs mlyik angel mlyk angels mlim teacher mlm teachers addu my brother addu my brothersIn this language, a low tone on kam indicates a single chief, but if you raise the tone to a high tone, you get km \'chiefs\'. Only two languages in WALS\'s survey of almost a thousand languages formed plurals in this way. Only slightly less rare is internal stem change, which is found in Maricopa, a language of California:(2) Maricopa: humar child  humaar children nchen older sibling nchiin older siblings hat dog haat dogs mhay boy mhaa boysAlthough both of these strategies are rare, they don\'t really strike you as \'strange\' in the sense of counterintuitive. They are rather unusual simply because they are systematic, not because the processes themselves are odd. Even some of the counterintuitive systems, like French and Sinhala disfixation, which subtract parts of the stem to form a plural, are not really so rare either.Maybe a better way to think about exotica in pluralization is not the formation of plurals, but the target of plurals -- which words get pluralized. In this sense, the oddest plural I\'ve ever come across is surely the Kiowa inverse number system. In this language, nouns are marked for what number they are not, rather than for what number they are. In the four noun classes of the language, some are inherently singular or dual (Class I), others are inherently dual or plural (class II), others are inherently dual (Class III), and yet others are mass nouns and never pluralize. What\'s odd about this system is that if you add an inverse suffix -gau [2] to class one, you get a plural, but if you add the very same suffix to class two, you get a singular:So for example, a class I word like c \'horse, two horses\' becomes cgau \'three or more horses\', while a class II word like ths \'two or more bones\' becomes thsgau \'one bone\'. A class III word like l \'two apples\' likewise has an inverse form lb \'one or three or more apples (but not two apples)\'. A system like this one is really exceptionally rare, a true rarissimum of linguistic typology.[1] Octopus comes from Greek: okto \'eight\' and pous \'foot\'. Since the plural of pous is podes, the correct plural is octopodes. Octopi comes from mistaking the -us ending as a Latin second declension masculine noun, which it is not. [2] Actually one among many inverse suffixes.Works Cited:Dryer, Matthew S. 2005. "33. Coding of Nominal Plurality." WALS.Mithun, M. 2001. The languages of native North America.

S" I think Geoff Pullum has addressed this issue at length in his many public comments about the way grammar is taught in the English speaking world today. Basically, he argues that grammar teaching hasn't really advanced substantially in two centuries, and the result is that people believe and teach all sorts of crazy unfounded things about language. Here's an excerpt about him in the Telegraph (Are 'grammar Nazis' ruining the English language? ):Imagine a world in which biology was taught using no textbooks written later than 1795; a world in which the advances of the science since the publication of On the Origin of Species  or even since Charles Darwin was born  were ignored. The theory of evolution would remain untaught; the existence of bacteria would never be mentioned. Biologists would be furious. So imagine how Prof Geoffrey Pullum feels when he sees the same thing happening in his own field every day. [...]Rules such as this have been discovered through careful study of how English speakers actually use the language. An enormous amount more is understood today than it was in, say, 1900, says Pullum. There have been discoveries that make the pattern of things easier to grasp.But instead of this sort of discovery making it into popular consciousness, he says, the national discussion of grammar and language is stuck in half-remembered dictates and daft shibboleths. What is taught in schools, and in popular books for laypeople, is the same as it was in 1900, and much the same as it was in 1800. The public is denied all of it.In other words, there are plenty of otherwise educated, intelligent people out there who simply are ignorant of the way the world actually works. If we taught grammar in public schools like we taught chemistry, people would have a better understanding of what language is, and how it functions."

S' I consider it good practice because after skateboarding in junior high and high school, my friends and I all got snowboards, had the basics down after just a day or three, and were working on "advanced" stuff like jumps and moguls after that.You learn to balance, and you learn it with a stance and posture that is pretty close to snowboarding. Not exactly the same, but close enough to give you a huge advantage over anyone who hasn\'t done something similar. You learn to keep your weight between your feet, to lean into turns, to compress when you start to lose your balance, and so on. You learn to be comfortable with speed.'

S' There are a few reasons... Any attack on the Kim regime would lead to massive casualties in South Korea because the North Korean army is prepared to launch massive amounts of artillery across the boarder. Also note that South Korea\'s capital city, Seoul, is located near the boarder, providing a target-rich environment for all of that artillery.The world watched as brutal regimes were dismantled in Afghanistan and Iraq not so long ago, and neither of those "regime changes" ended well. The Kim regime is responsible for the humanitarian crises of North Korea today. Nobody wants to be responsible for the crises of a Kim-less North Korea tomorrow.War in North Korea would likely trigger a massive refugee crisis, its neighbors (China and Korea) are not ready to handle. Consider the exodus from Syria into Europe, for example.Until relatively recently, it was assumed that China would come to North Korea\'s defense. Relatively recently, North Korea seems to have developed nuclear bombs. It probably does not have the ability to deliver them over long distances (e.g. with ICBMs) but it might be able to deliver them to coastal cities.Those last two items are far from certain, but either possibility is enough to deter would-be attackers. Combine those with the certain consequences (casualties in South Korea, refugees fleeing north and south) and uncertain consequences (things may not improve for the people of North Korea), and nobody wants to get involved.'

There are still powerful organizations - from the secret service to the FBI to the local police to every branch of the armed services - that would merely regard you as a criminal and would therefore treat you like one. You would almost certainly be killed within minutes, perhaps hours if you were very clever or lucky. Your only chance of leaving the White House alive (and it is a very slim chance) would be if you walked out with your hands up and cooperated with the people who would be handcuffing you. You would then die in prison, one way or another. The best outcome you could hope for would be to die in prison of old age, but in the unlikely event that you survived long enough to be arrested you'd probably end up with a lethal injection a few years later."

S' Try karting instead. The speeds are lower, so it is somewhat less dangerous, but it still includes most of what makes car racing fun. You might find that it scratches the same itch for you.Also consider racing in ChumpCar World Series or LeMons. The cars are nowhere near as fast as your cars, but fast enough to be loads of fun, and the cars are safer due to the required roll cages, harnesses, etc. And the races are long. The shortest race that my friends and I have entered was 6 hours, the longest was 36. After about 90 minutes behind the wheel, it starts to feel more like work than play. But doing lap after lap for such a long duration gives you lots and lots of time to experiment with line choices and really learn a lot about racing.'

S' Take a course that teaches when lethal force is and is not acceptable, and how to behave in a lethal-force situation.In my area there are courses named "General Defensive Handgun" offered by a couple of different schools - I haven\'t looked into where that term came from but I suspect it\'s a standard of some sort. They cover safe handling and shooting technique, but most of the class time was spent on legal questions and how to distinguish yourself from a murderer (in the eyes of police and bystanders) should you be forced to shoot.Time spent practicing at the range won\'t teach you this stuff. Much of what everybody knows is actually fiction. The recent incident of a vigilante shooting at a shoplifter is sounds like a pretty clear example of someone who knew much less about firearms than they thought they did. Unless new information comes to light, I\'d expect the shooter to spend some time in jail, and lose their right to own firearms ever again (assault with a deadly weapon is a felony, and felons are prohibited).

S" No. We know quite a bit about how X and Y chromosomes produce male and female genitalia, but we don't know nearly enough about what causes a person's brain to identify as male or female. It is entirely possible that people with gender dysphoria have brains that have perfectly sound biological reasons for identifying as a gender other than what their chromosomes would typically lead to.Not to mention people whose bodies have clearly developed in a way that doesn't exactly match one end of the male-female spectrum or the other, or people whose chromosome's aren't simply XX or XY.Just because most people's minds do match their genitalia, doesn't mean that everyone's should match. Nor does it mean that for every case in which they don't match, there is a problem with the person's brain. For all we know, they may be in perfect mental health - they just were born with a body that doesn't match their brain. Imagine that you woke up tomorrow with a different set of genitals that you have today. You're still you, and your identity is the same as it ever was - only your anatomy is changed. Disorienting, right? Now imaging that for every day of your life, you have been waking up with that other anatomy. You're still you. You are still the same person that you have always been. You still identify as the person that have always been. But your body doesn't match your identity, and it never has. Would you consider yourself mentally ill if that were the case?"

S' No, it isn\'t. The best figures we have (discarding the NRA\'s wildly inflated numbers) indicate that defensive gun use outnumbers criminal gun use by roughly two to one. And by "we" I mean the Institute of Medicine, which was directed by President Obama to study firearm violence in the wake of the Sandy Hook murders.But defensive gun use barely makes the weekly police blotter, whereas mass shootings are inevitably followed by a week-long media extravaganza in which the perpetrator becomes a house-hold name. This has given many people a very distorted view of firearm use.One could argue just as convincingly that our culture\'s insistence on making mass murderers into celebrities is a mental illness. There is evidence that mass murder is contagious - mentally unstable people are inspired to kill by the fame that our culture has unfailingly bestowed upon the mass murderers who came before them.Firearm violence, like most forms of violence, has dropped almost by half in the last 20 years. One form of violence that has not declined is the form that guarantees its perpetrators celebrity status and national name recognition.Yet despite the decades-long drop in firearm violence, and the more-frequent use of firearms for self-defense, many people believe that gun violence is an increasing problem, and that guns are have no purpose other than murder. What\'s worse, the facts simply don\'t matter to those people. From the article:I know Im being a bit demeaning, but, damn it, I simply cant understand. And, frankly, I dont want to.This country does have problems with violence, firearms, and firearm violence.

Other mass killers have visited Columbine or written online of their admiration for the two perpetrators there.Most mass killers leak their intentions, dropping hints in conversation or on social media.

S' Consider this article from the New Yorker in 2012:The Simple Truth About Gun Control - The New YorkerParticularly this part:At some point, we will become a gun-safe, and then a gun-sane, and finally a gun-free society. Its closer than you think. That is the sort of phrase that causes gun owners to believe - not entirely incorrectly - that the true purpose of gun control legislation is to confiscate everyone\'s firearms. So gun owners dig in their heels. So nothing changes.Background checks are a nice idea in theory, but writers like this guy make it clear that limiting criminals\' access to firearms is just a step on the path to getting firearms out of everyone\'s hands. After checks are required, the requirements will be modified to prevent anyone from actually passing the check. (There is precedent - one of my colleagues came from a county in California that required specific training in order to obtain a concealed handgun license. The county didn\'t offer that training, so they didn\'t grant those licenses.)So it\'s not just "the NRA" that opposes background checks and registration requirements - it\'s a whole bunch of law-abiding, firearm-owning voters, who have been given solid reasons (for example, this article) to fear that background checks are a veiled attempt to ban ownership, and registration is a step toward confiscation. The NRA is just the mouthpiece.The "gun free society" advocates are just as much to blame for this deadlock as the NRA is. Perhaps moreso - the NRA\'s "extreme" positions are a rational response to an organized attempt to outlaw firearm ownership.I do think background checks are a good idea when a firearm changes ownership. But I understand why so many firearm owners are reluctant to support legislation proposed by people whose stated goal is, in this author\'s words "a gun-free society."'

S' The notion that good guys with guns can stop bad guys with guns is not based on the idea that armed bystanders should act as vigilantes. It is based on the idea that victims should have options other than begging for mercy.Firearms are for self-defense, not vigilante heroics.As the fellow in the article said, you don\'t want to be mistaken for the perpetrator when the police arrive. This is of course a risk even when defending yourself and a loved one, and many of the drills taught in firearm self-defense classes include elements that are intended to minimize that confusion (for example, shouting "drop the weapon" repeatedly).In addition, if you don\'t know the participants intimately, you yourself may not be able to tell aggressors from defenders, so you could end up making a bad situation much worse.In addition, it is obviously far safer to flee danger than to get involved. In addition, even in the best-case scenario, in which you miraculously shoot the aggressor and don\'t get shot by the aggressor or another good-guy-with-a-gun, you\'re likely to lose everything you own defending against criminal charges brought by people who weren\'t there to see what you saw, in addition to a civil suit by the aggressor or their surviving kin. So unless you or a loved one is in immediate danger of a much worse outcome, it\'s best to just get yourself and your loved ones as far away as fast as possible.I have taken three classes on gun safety and self-defense, from two schools, and in every class the position on this issue has been the exactly same - do not get involved in violence unless you or your loved ones are being threatened.'

S' Hopefully that layman has a long attention span, because this is complicated. The conflict has its roots in the SykesPicot Agreement of 1916, in which the British and French agreed upon separate \'spheres of influence\' in the middle East. Over the next decades, various states and governments were declared in the area, mostly with little or no regard to the existing power structures.But then let us fast-forward to just a few years ago... Bashar al Assad, the President or Syria, was like his father before him, an authoritarian ruler.In nearby countries, people protested their authoritarian rulers in a series of demonstrations that came to be known as the "Arab Spring."

S' Cancer. One could argue that cancer is just a side-effect of a system that works pretty well overall. Evolution created countless species, inhabiting every possible ecological niche. It has been marvelously effective in finding ways to exploit an amazing variety of habitats and energy sources. But evolution also created the potential for cancer, and if you\'re an individual with cancer, it sucks. It\'ll probably kill you - slowly, painfully, miserably. It is interesting to look at cancer as a product of evolution on two levels. At the macro level, millions of years of evolution have brought us countless species, by producing (and selecting for) genes that mutate ever-so-slightly. Most mutations are harmful, but a few end up being beneficial, allowing their carries to reproduce more effectively than the competition. Some of those harmful mutations resulting in unviable offspring (perhaps another candidate for "worst product of evolution"), others produce tumors that lead to death at an arbitrary age.At the micro level, most individuals are born cancer-free, but mutations that accumulate over time eventually give rise to a cancer cell. The cancer cell then reproduces more effectively than its non-cancerous competition - winning the evolution game among its peers, but ultimately killing the creature that carries it, thus bringing about its own demise.Cancer just sucks any way you look at it. So it gets my vote for "worst product of evolution."'

S' ...and correspondingly, why have previous generations been so nonchalant about social injustice and identity? Why did so many people, for so many years, think that it was OK to marginalize groups of people based on such arbitrary factors as race, religion, gender, sexual preference, and so on?The first thing to note is that this is not new. The "obsession" with righting pervasive wrongs goes back centuries. In the United States, arguments over slavery date back to at least the 1700s, and in the mid-1800s there were heated arguments over whether or not women should be allowed to vote. Sexual preference and gender identity are just the latest issues to be added to the list of things that only matter to bigots.There\'s a common bumper-sticker that says "If you\'re not outraged, you\'re not paying attention." More people are paying attention. Over time, more and more younger people have steadily recognized that it makes no sense to persecute people based on these arbitrary factors. And, at the risk of sounding morbid, older people who thought that such discrimination was acceptable or even beneficial have been steadily dying off.If the "obsession" is greater today than in the past, it is simply because the problems have been studied, discussed, and broadcast to society-at-large more effectively than ever before. And that in turn is just because the problems have been present for longer than ever before.'

But if that were to happen tomorrow, we would still have a couple more obstacles (in addition to batteries) preventing widespread adoption.In order to fly unsupervised in arbitrary environments, drones need to be able to detect and avoid obstacles. Detection is the hard part. We either need better sensor technology, or better software to interpret the output of existing sensors. For example, 3D sensors like Microsoft's Kinect can do a great job of mapping an environment, but they are still large, heavy, and power-hungry, and their range is limited. On the other hand, it is very common to put small, lightweight, low-power cameras on drones, but software that can create a model of the surrounding, suitable for use by navigation algorithms, is hard to come by. There are still PhD-level projects in progress to develop better sensors and better software.If the regulatory questions are resolved, I'd expect to see more funding put into these sorts of things, so solutions may not be far off.

To find out, tell him what's going on, and see how he reacts.Maybe he'll say he was surprised to learn that, and then he'll respond appropriately. Then you can more forward together.Maybe he'll express surprise, then respond inappropriately. Now you have a new problem, but at least you'll both understand where the disagreement is.

S' "What is a good snowboard" depends more on your personal preferences than anything else. For some narrow, well-defined disciplines like racing, there are key parameters that you probably won\'t want to deviate from very much, but freeride is a pretty broad term.If you are in an area where it is feasible to rent a few different kinds of boards, that\'s a great way to try boards with different charcteristics. Take notes on length, width, sidecut radius (a massively under-appreciated parameter) and how you felt on that board in different conditions. Groomed, moguled, powder, steep, fast, etc, etc.Eventually you\'ll find what your own preferences are - longer or shorter, stiffer or softer, wider or narrower, larger or smaller sidecut radius, etc.Or you can just pick a high-end model from a high-end brand. The industry is mature enough that you\'re very unlikely to get a substandard board that way. But without trying a few options you also won\'t know what you\'re missing.Also, if you find that what you want isn\'t actually available in any manufacturer\'s catalog, you can go to companies that will build boards to your specifications, like Prior or Donek. Personally, I like a short stiff board with a large sidecut radius, which is an odd combination, so I have a couple of custom boards from Donek, and I\'ve been really happy with them.'

It is almost a commodity business.There are still some patents covering key aspects of powder-based printing, so the people/companies that hold those patents can charge a premium. However I'm told that the first wave of those patents are going to expire soon, after which we can expect a surge in competition in that area as well - with an accompanying drop in prices (good for consumers) and profit margins (not good for producers).So if you want to go into hardware your only chance of earning big money would be to come up with patents that advance the state-of-the-art.

Transformative innovation is difficult - the rewards for success are great, but this is essentially a research endeavour where lots of things must be tried just in hopes of finding something that really changes the game.Software: There are also a ton of options for modeling software, which drives down margins here too. Many players in this area are offering their software at very low cost or even free, in the hopes that users will upgrade to paid versions for specific features. As a hobbyist who could never afford high-end modeling software, the drop in prices over the last few years has been delightful - I never thought I'd own parametric modeling software like PTC Creo, Cubify Design, Autodesk Fusion 360... and the free/open-source projects have grown very powerful, for example Blender and OpenScad.So if you want to go into software you'd best have an exceptional passion for the field because it will be a challenge to stand out from the crowd.Modeling: Now that powerful hardware and software is readily available at low cost, 3D modeling is becoming a field that anyone can get involved in. Which, again, makes it a commodity business. Like photography, modeling is something that a lot of people will do for fun and a barely-sustainable amount of money. Like photography, people who are exceptionally good at it will probably always be able to make a living doing exceptionally high-quality work very quickly, but like photography there will be hordes of people eager to compete on price, making it hard to make a good living.So if you want to make a living making models, you'd best have an exceptional passion for it, else you won't stand out from all of the other folks who are doing the same thing.Marketplaces: Thingiverse has a great place to advertise a share models. They have quite a network built of modelers and consumers. There are plentry of upstarts who want a chunk of that business but I suspect that this is a market that will only have a very small number of successes (thing ebay, facebook, craigslist) so most of the upstarts are probably doomed.Fabrication: Everybody who buys a 3D printer has an investment that sits idle for much of the time... So many printer owners are motivated to put their printers to use, making parts for people who don't have printers. Again there is little opportunity for anyone to charge a premium, because there are so many people offering the same set of services.So if you want to make a living printing models, you'd best have an exceptional passion for it, else you won't stand out from all of the other folks who are doing the same thing.--What other options exist for careers in 3D printing? I don't know.It's a fun hobby, so don't hesitate to get involved. But I expect to see few people make a good deal of money from any aspect of it. The great thing about the explosion in 3D printing is that anyone can get involved in any aspect of production.... But, this isn't so great for producers, because anyone can get involved in any aspect of production."

S' Yes, definitely. I\'m certain that eventually automation will advance to a point where the cost of production for everything will drop to zero. Human effort, blue-collar or white-collar, will be literally worthless. But no cost of production will mean no cost of goods and services, which will mean no cost required to keep people comfortable. So while nobody will be able to get a job, that won\'t be a problem because nobody will need a job. I\'m confident that humanity will reach that state eventually, but I am not confident that the transition will be a smooth one.Right now, most people work 4-5 decades to earn what they need to support themselves for another decade or three in retirement. If we\'re lucky, the working period will gradually shrink to nothing, and it\'ll be a smooth transition.If we\'re not lucky, jobs will disappear before prices fall enough to allow everyone to retire after little or no work. In between, we\'ll have poverty, suffering, and rioting.There are also some guaranteed minimum income experiments happening already. If we\'re lucky, that sort of thing will catch on quickly enough to avoid large-scale and/or long-term suffering. If we\'re not lucky, there will be decades of pervasive poverty before the powers-that-be realize that we need, as David S. Rose put it, "a complete rethinking of how we deal with sustenance."I want to be optimistic about this, but I\'m not convinced that I should be.'

So the process involves a lot of false negatives - candidates rejected for relatively minor reasons. A lack of CS education might be offset by good experience (many people in the industry now got there after a career change), and lack of experience is very often offset by education (such as most college hires). But having neither makes it easy to pass over your rsum.You would need to have something on your rsum that offsets your lack of education and experience. The only thing I can think of that might do that would be a very impressive piece of software written by yourself.Something like, "working alone, I wrote a piece of software which allows users to ___________." What you put into that blank needs to make the screeners think "wow, if this is true then this candidate could be great despite that lack of education and short experience."I don\'t have any bright ideas about what to put into that blank. Normally, contributing to an open-source project can\'t hurt, but in this case your background would probably lead rsum readers to assume that your contributions were commensurate with your lack of experience.

S' So as the wind blows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, so people will flow from areas of hardship to a place they perceive will bring them more safety and/or prosperity.The migrant crisis essentially includes both migrants and refugees. The legal distinction between them is clear. I see migrants as people who are on the move, particularly between nations and particularly on a semi-permanent basis.According to the Geneva Refugee Convention, refugees are:"A person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it."Regular migrants and refugees could both be in flight for fear of their lives, in the former case simply because they cannot afford food or shelter.There is great discord and danger in many parts of the world. In particular, there is disruptive conflict in (amongst other places) Nigeria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Palestinian Territories, Ukraine and Syria. The populaces of these places have had enough, and many of them tried to escape months or years ago.Many thousands have died en route, ferried by unscrupulous smugglers across the Mediterranean in ships manifestly unfit for purpose. Many more thousands have made it into the EU, some above the radar as successful asylum seekers and some below the radar as illegal migrant workers.For reasons that are not fully clear to me, many tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands are now trying to make the journey. We imagine most of the refugees are from Syria or IS-controlled territory in Iraq. Things are truly awful in those places and I find it very easy to be sympathetic to those people trying to get their families away, despite the great risks. The \'push factor\' of their home circumstances is the main factor driving them away. But - up to a point - there is probably a \'pull factor\' drawing migrants and refugees into the EU also. They don\'t tend to head east, but west into the EU where greater hope is to be found.Media coverage in recent months has intensified. This is a reflection of its increasing draw as a news story (ie migration has stepped up). It feels a bit Catch-22, but I suspect the reason that migration has really peaked in recent weeks is due - in part - to the media attention.My recent blog on the story, following the death of 3-year-old Alan Kurdi:Alan Kurdi\'s death creates an opportunity and an obligation on us all'

S" I continue to use the word migrants because in my view it seems to be both the most neutral and broadest term - including immigrants, emigrants, legal and illegal migrants, asylum seekers and refugees.Very often it's unclear precisely which category the latest migrants fall into, and it would be a mistake to label them refugees until they've been legally afforded that status. In many cases, while some of them might well be able to claims asylum, they choose not to do so, and assume for themselves the attitude of economic migrants, seeking to settle in Germany or the UK, for example, rather than in the first state they arrive in upon fleeing conflict or persecution.I understand that many people feel the term 'migrant' is pejorative. I believe this is because many people are unhappy with high levels of incoming migration. Relabeling - without clear justification - many migrants as refugees will do nothing to resolve people's concerns about migration and may threaten to undermine the plight of genuine refugees.----------Here's the BBC's editorial take on the question:The battle over the words used to describe migrants - BBC News"

I won't put a figure on it, but I think it's highly improbable that ISIS's territory will expand much beyond its present borders. Certainly as they press north into Turkey they will find the full might of Nato upon them. They have few friends to the east or the south, and those nations threatened by them will have a range of world powers weighed against them.As ISIS expands (if that happens), expect the permanent members of the UN Security Council to unite (a rare feat).

For me, Mac Tan's answer hits the nail on the head, with regard to the impact of the #BlackLivesMatter campaign and how it's been handled by Hillary.She has, it would seem, the luxury of being able to focus a little further ahead towards the main presidential contest, because she's picked up such a huge virtual* lead in the primary contest.

S" (British-centric answer)There is a great reel of examples here: Page on telegraph.co.ukThe answer is both yes and no, depending on the context and the publication. As I see it, these are the factors at play:Is the publication favourably or unfavourably disposed to the politician in question? Some papers have a clear interest in showing their favoured political leader in a good light and others awkwardly eating a bacon sandwich. Some papers and broadcasters (particularly in the UK) will tend to select pictures showing a much more straightforward image.Is the photograph one which is so unusual that it merits a story in and of itself? Consider Boris Johnson on the zip-wire, for example, or President GW Bush being pecked by a pardoned turkey, or David Miliband with his banana. Those are such cracking moments in time they fairly deserve their moment in the sun, or in The Sun even.Does the story demand a more serious treatment? I would expect even the Daily Mirror to choose a reasonable shot of David Cameron to illustrate its VJ Day coverage, for example. It just wouldn't do to select an unflattering comedy shot to illustrate such a serious story. But there is a grey area, and it's not uncommon for a paper of the left to show pictures of David Cameron or George Osborne apparently snarling or laughing at the plight of the poor, or for a paper of the right to show an equally unflattering picture of a Labour leader to illustrate other serious political news stories.While I think it can be unduly unfair or deceptive to show especially unflattering pictures of politicians, I think most readers are likely to see through it. It says more about the publication than about the leader in question.In my working role for the BBC I select video material for news output. If I see material which is comically unflattering, I may well try to find a place for it, but I am cautious about this and never seek to distort the news agenda in my choice of pictures."

You live in a country where even fair complexion is a check box when it comes bride hunting; forget about T1D & Stargardt disease (Heredomacular degeneration).An optimist me would say- Dude! Chuck marriage. Learn to manage your challenges, love will come along following.During my stint as a T1D researcher, I have met many patients who gave up on their challenge, fell into depression and became ugly (in the literal sense). I also met couples where one partner was all healthy and helped in managing the challenges of the other partner. They were happy people, seemingly normal, talked about happy things, looked beautiful and were OPTIMISTIC. IMHO, you should focus more on managing your challenges, stabilizing both T1D & SD. Feel good about yourself and love will come following. Learn about people who are fighting the same challenge and winning hands down. It will boost your morale. Shun everybody who makes you feel deficient. There is lot of literature to manage T1D. SD people can wear cool sunglasses. I am told that it really helps. Hope you find love :)"

S' The movie distribution is obviously driven by revenue generation. If the cost of screening a movie in a town/ city is not significantly lower than the revenue it is projected to generate, then the town/city would be passed.In tier 2 and tier 3 cities, fandom base of superhero movies is passable. The residents might enjoy movies like Terminator in local language, where there is an entertaining violence. But for superhero movies they might not be motivated enough to flock theatres. Also a factor to be considered is local language. The cost of dubbing a movie in a local language should be more than compensated in the revenue that it will generate in that town/city. In addition, some popular movies are screened later in non-metro cities when they have shown good business in metro i.e. when they become good bets.Thanks for A2A :)'

S' Ant man is a cinematic treat. SPOILERS AHEAD.The conceptFor a person unequipped with the intricacies of a super hero character, it doesnt discriminate. You are narrated the origin and conflict of the protagonist so well that it becomes extremely relatable. There is a father with an estranged daughter, a mentee feeling betrayed by his mentor because the latter did not impart all knowledge, a father who falls to commit crime whenever under duress and wants to provide everything for his little daughter. Added to all this is a technology which obviously has political repercussions. But what makes Antman so awesome? It is its script that seamlessly weaves all of it in one fabric.The dialoguesI found them the most engaging part of the movie after the concept. They are sarcastic, funny and offer a fair share of giggles. Michael Penas (Luis) lip sync, Michael Douglas (Pym) shoot me again, Evangeline Lillys (Hope) fight with Paul Rudd (Scott Lang) and Scotts daughter, Cassies this toy is so ugly are hilarious. Even people with no interest in MCU could engage in the movie because of clever scriptwriting. Coupled with the awesome dialogues, the reference to the Avengers is comical.The visual effectsIt is almost a routine that Marvel are surpassing their own milestones when it comes to visuals. While the Ant man reminds you of vintage rustiness and the yellow jacket is technologically more violent. The portrayal of ants makes you perceive these creatures in an altogether new way. The quantum realm is so beautifully imagined that it looks almost real. Particularly the fight scenes at toy train are remarkably scripted. For the most part visuals dont override the live characters. All in all, the movie is much more worth than money. We walk out of the theatre wanting more. Also, it introduces Ant man to the mass in general who have only known likes of Iron Man, Super Man and Batman.'

S" T1D cure has been testing the patience of researchers. The cure has been distant because,Incomplete understanding of the mechanism of disease development and progression precludes development of rationally designed drug.i.e. You can't fight an enemy if you barely know its origin, strategy of advancement and the system that it has eyes on. However the advancement made in the last decade is way more than previous. The glitch is that it is not an obvious result that masses understand. People want to see headlines that we have cured T1D and they can avail the medicine at the nearest drug store. We are far from that. But that doesn't mean we are not progressing. Each discovery is a milestone and each clinical trial failure costs billions and decades. It takes approximately 15 years to get the therapy safe for deployment under registered practitioners. So the technology (sic) is not slowly advancing, it's just that you don't notice its silent achievements."

T1D is a complex disorder with very poorly known causes. We can't fight an unknown enemy easily. With the knowledge that we have about T1D, we are actually doing good.For people unknown of clinical trials, its a multi step, complicated, monitored and regulated test of potential medicines. One crucial step is to test them at mice, dog or monkeys. Human trial is a very advanced stage. It's a milestone to get positive result with other species but the final destination is not so close. In the quoted article the researchers have used Gene Therapy. We are a bit far to get it safely approved for human beings. The article concludes,In conclusion, this study paves the way for the clinical translation of this approach to gene therapy to veterinary medicine, and eventually to diabetic patients.So the answer is YES. A cure for T1D is on the way, but the success would test our patience."

S" Autoimmune TherapyIt's very much under clinical trials.According to WHO, 246 million people in the world are living with diabetes. Type 1 or juvenile diabetes affects approximately 70,000 children under the age of 15 every year and around 3.2 million people in the world die due to diabetes or its related causes per year.Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disorder and it may develop at any age.Incomplete understanding of the mechanism of disease development and progression precludes development of rationally designed drug.Presently the treatment involves insulin administration by injection or pump. Both are invasive methods, pain and hence non-compliance is usually observed in patients. The present treatment is also an economic burden to patients. Given the availability of advanced biomarkers and genetic markers as an accurate proxy for disease detection, it becomes relevant to develop intervention therapy.Autoimmune therapy targets auto-antigens without compromising the organisms capabilities to mount an immune response against foreign antigen. Oral administration of protein antigens can result in diminished peripheral immune responses to a subsequent systemic challenge with the same antigen, in a process known as oral immune tolerance.With greater patient acceptance of oral rather than systemic therapies (e.g., by injection) and antigen-specific effects without toxic effects of general immunosuppression, oral tolerance remains an attractive strategy.Insulin is obvious auto-antigen implicated in T1 Diabetes. C-peptide, a component of Proinsulin is reported to have beneficial impact on nerve functions, renal structure and renal function. C peptide is not available with commercial insulin preparations. Hence, engineering proinsulin gene in plants would have an added advantage over insulin.Other autoantigens in order of significance are Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), Insulinoma Associated-2 antigen (IA-2), Heat Shock Protein (HSP), Zinc transporter-8 (ZnT8), Pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor 1 (PDX1), Chromogranin A (CHGA). Immune therapies targeting GAD65 and Insulin have been tested in both animal models and in human T1D patients. Presence of a mucosal adjuvant or carrier molecule is required for enhancement of oral tolerance. Cholera Toxin Subunit B (CTB) has been shown to promote immunological tolerance against certain types of mucosally co-administered antigens, preferably tissue antigens linked to the CTB molecule. Cholera Toxin (CT) is made up of two types of subunits; subunit A being toxic and embedded in circular homopentamer of subunit B. The subunit B is responsible for binding of CT to its receptor, GM1 ganglioside. CTB is outstandingly stable against proteases, bile components and other factors in the intestinal milieu.References:Clemente-Casares X., Tsai S., Huang C. and Santamaria P.

This might sound cheesy and overly romantic to some but I could never think of anything but his name to get permanently inked.Some quipped me over it that I took PDA to another level, some commented that I am inspired by a growing trend among celebrities, others thought that I could use it to emotionally blackmail him. So much for a little tattoo!A lot of people emphasized that I could have waited till getting engaged or married, with extra emphasis on the fact that it\'s difficult to get tattoo removed.Harsh\'s reaction was "Wow! supercool! But you could have waited, we could get it together".He was concerned about healing, especially when the tattoo looked hideous during scabbing.It means a lot. Most of the time I am oblivious of its existence, but when somebody points it out or when I see it in quiet hours, it reflects on my love for him and his for mine.I guess the sole feeling that drives people to get tattooed is seeking an omni reminder about something that you care for.Here is the pic,'

S' Following points should be taken care of,Proper canine nutritionDogs require food specially designed for canines. A food substance, which might be healthier for you might be harmful for your pet. Dont stuff your pet with the food of your liking. Select a food from best dog food brands according to body weight, breed and age of your pet. Food requirement of a puppy differs from an adult dog and a nursing bitch.Diverse nutritionNutrients differ in their goodness with their sources. So its important that you provide a diverse cuisine instead of feeding the same dry food pellets. Market is replete with dog treats, dog canned food, dog snacks and whatnot. The food platter of your dog should be diverse besides being healthy.Omnivore nutritionDogs are genetically omnivore. Their natural food habit is eating lower animals. So its common sense to avoid grain rich foods or vegan diet. Cheap dog food vendors use grain as fillers and this is not the best choice for your dog nutrition. So prefer buying best food for dogsfrom recognized brands.Choosing the right food for dog also requires some empirical research. You need to try new food in small proportions and observe your dog for its health, looking for food and will to be fed.'

S" The male penis swells inside the female's vagina during the mating, causing them to get virtually locked. It is absolutely normal phenomenon. They might be locked for some good 15-20 minutes during which ejaculation takes place. One should not attempt to separate them, to allow successful mating. A small bone is found inside the dog's penis called baculum that holds the penis while attempting penetration. Once the penis has reached inside the vagina, the bulbus glandis (found at base of penis) will start to congest with blood and swells, to eventually lock the mating couple. It is popularly called mating tie.Sometimes in disparate mating, larger size female (or a virgin female) gets panicked and swings the male while its penis is still stuck inside. Poor guy!P.S.

S' Bedroom is a part of the home earmarked for the sleep. Bedroom impacts the lives of the people more than any other space in the home, as it is the place where one spends quality individual time. The master bedroom of the home should not only houseaesthetically pleasing and functional furniture but should also induce a sense of tranquility. The smartest and the quickest way to impart novelty to your bedroom is redoing the furniture. A functional piece of furniture would occupy less space and help you managing your stuff efficiently. Here are some quick doable tips to do a makeover of your bedroom, which will also pep up your love lives.1. While redoing the furniture you can consider switching the style like from contemporary to eclectic to traditional to modern. One can also think of thematic makeover, for example Victorian or beach style.2. The size of furniture should be such that the space doesnt get cramped up. Thespatial availability is the decisive factor to choose from compact or expansive furniture. So if your present space looks crowded then its time that you downsize the size of furniture and let the room breathe.3. Flooringis crucial to space aesthetics. One can think of switching from ceramic tiles to dark hardwood. Change in flooring is so expansive that it immediately brings a pleasing change to notice.4. Change in source of lighting can bring colossal visual changes. By rule the lighting in the master bedroom should not be too luminous. The light should be gentle on eyes while providing sufficient visibility. A soothing candleholder can incite the romance.5. A piece of art is able to bring comeliness in your bedroom. There is no rule but the creation should go with the overall theme. For example a contemporary abstract would not bring beauty in a Victorian furnished bedroom.6. A beautiful framed mirror whose material type goes with furniture can vim the bedroom dcor. Its size should accentuate the space availability and should not reduce it.'

S' Freelancing has appeared as a choice of employment for a wide range of employees. It is now an economically viable option to people who like to work at their own terms, who prefer to devote certain duration of time for a project, who have time/space constraints and who prefer it until they find their dream job.According to a 2010 survey conducted by Intuit , a software company , by 2020 four out of every ten American (i.e. 40% of US workforce) would go for freelancing. This trend is bound to be replicated in EU and other developed countries. The figures may not be high for developing countries but a large number of startups are preferring freelancers over permanent employees. Experts attribute this shift to passion for work and flexibility attached with freelancing. Many permanent employees have found that they are more productive and creative when they are not attached with long-term employer. Their ability to think out of box is enhanced when they are working with new employer for a brief stint. Thisno-strings-attached model is gathering momentum in almost all domains, be it industry or corporates. The forerunners in freelancing are developers and programmers. In spite of certain disadvantages, freelancing is bound to be the choice of employment of future. Theubiquitous Internet access, availability of all work tools in cloud and sense of freedom from cubicle workplace in newer generation emphasizes that employers would have to facilitate a fraction of jobs for freelancing. Employers are also finding freelancing better than age-old notion of permanent employee because of the enhanced productivity, innovativeness and work rules.Some corporations also see freelancers as job hoppers, the line of differentiation is blurred. But the trends suggest that freelancing is here to stay. Employers would have to create a work ecosystem where all types of employees can work in harmony and contribute to the common end. The top 20 admired corporations of the world have already felt the impending need and have started imbibing more of freelancers and virtual employees. The stigma with being self-employed is also breaking down. The social perception with this fraction of workforce is not what it used to be a decade earlier.But, freelancing is not all white as it seems to be. Full time job has advantages of employer-sponsored benefits like pensions, insurance and appraisals. These are not equally accessible to freelancers as of now. It is also not very clear as how these employees should be taxed. It needs global discussion , change in policies and regulation of terms and conditions to make freelancing come under the same radar as full time employment. The benefits should be proportionate to work and not the type of employment.'

It isn't flippant remarks or half-assed answers intended to ridicule the OP. Those answers provide zero value, are offensive, lazy and thus, should be flagged.Satire is an intelligent, highly-resourced and well-honed literary genre that brings out well-documented fallacies about a particular institution, group of people or policies so that the readers will be awakened to obvious truths of injustice (and thus want to change those institutions, people etc.). Its tone will be tongue-in-cheek and glip (i.e. not in earnest) but the content will be detailed, compelling. It doesn't take cheap shots by being racist, sexist, classist, or other - ist for the sake of it.If something makes you laugh and you move on, it's likely not satire. If it makes you laugh and think and squirm and care - that is satire.Right now, Quora absolutely supports satire. Among others a few Quorans who write witty, bitting, satirical answers include Noam Kaiser, Joshua Engel, Joe Geronimo Martinez, Feifei Wang, Erica Friedman, Robert Frost, Dan Knight, Dan Holliday and of course Upworthy's Adam Mordecai."

We abide by it in order to enjoy the privileges our society offers.This social contact includes, among other things;- Not cutting in line (and respecting a line in the first place),- Not letting your dog shit on someone\'s property,- Not shouting in libraries or churches,- Not disrespecting or defacing a U.S. flag,- Not urinating in public,- Not "accidentally" touching women,- AND tipping waiters. 15% if they are bad, more than 15% if they are good. 0% ONLY if they are offensive and disrespectful and a 0% tip should always be accompanied by a formal complaint to their manager. If you don\'t have enough money, you come back or apologize very sincerely.Some cities and states institutionalize these rules as laws. Others rely on the good grace of individuals. But all countries expect its citizens - and tourists - to engage in the social contract.The result of this is we - and you by being here - get to enjoy privileges like not stepping dog shit, being free from the stench of someone else\'s urine, being able to read or pray in peace, being rewarded for waiting and knowing that if you wait, you will get help, and not being groped on the streets.AND you get to enjoy good service at restaurants. I never appreciated service until I moved to the UK, where most waiters would sooner spit on me than take my order. That, incidentally, is also part of the social contract; waiters must provide good service.Tipping waiters is what we do in America. The tipping culture exists to compel better service and cheaper meals. It allows (or should allow) the best waiters to get the most reward. (Whether it does or not is a much bigger issue than you tipping your waiter or not).If you respect America enough to visit, and to enjoy its many, many privileges, you have to respect this too.'

S' I need to answer this in two parts. 1. What is an Essay (and how do you define it)?2. How can you write a better one?I don\'t mean to patronize but if you want to write essays, you must know what they are, and what they aren\'t. I\'m not sure many people know or agree on the definition, I\'m not sure I know, but I\'ll essais to describe it.And that stupid pun is the essence what we\'re talking about. The Essais (conjugation of the French verb essayer, to try), was popularized by French writer/statesman/man of letters Michel de Montaigne as a writing that attempts to prove, describe, debate, and discuss something critical and fundamental and perhaps not conclusively decided. "Functional prose" it\'s been called.Montaigne wrote Essais in 1580 as a combination of political viewpoints, personal anecdotes and self-discovery. Surprisingly the volumes were mainly attractive to females, at least those were fortunate enough to be able to read. Or perhaps not surprising since the writings were intimate and personal in nature.From Montaigne to present, the essay has taken many forms and frequently used more as a genre to describe a well-conceived, argued, reasoned, non-fiction. Which is a very broad genre, indeed. Obviously there are nuances but understanding the polemics of The Essay is critical. The Wikipedia entry on Essays is outstandingly good starting point, relying on Aldous Huxley\'s taxonomy of Essay types:1) The personal and the autobiographical: The essayists that feel most comfortable in this pole "write fragments of reflective autobiography and look at the world through the keyhole of anecdote and description"2) The objective, the factual, and the concrete-particular: The essayists that write from this pole "do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Their art consists on setting forth, passing judgement upon, and drawing general conclusions from the relevant data"3) The abstract-universal: In this pole "we find those essayists who do their work in the world of high abstractions", who are never personal and who seldom mention the particular facts of experience.I tried to find examples of each in broad topics so you could see how much they vary;An example of #1 would be Joan Didion\'s long-form essay "The Year of Magical Thinking" which describes the year following her husband\'s sudden death and using that frame of reference to explore death, loss, grief, loneliness etc. It is highly personal (too personal, if you ask me).Virginia Woolf\'s A Room of One\'s Own is another excellent example but with more personal distance. She states up front that she will address the issue of women and fiction (namely what prevents women from creating fiction) and will do so by presenting us her logic and reasoning not the actual answer because "when a subject is highly controversial, one cannot hope to tell the truth, one can only show how one came to hold whatever opinion on does hold."An example of #2 would be Thomas Malthus\'s An Essay on the Principle of Population, which few people have read but everyone thinks of as shorthand for the argument "people will outpace food supplies." Malthus talks in data and numbers and logic and reasons his (incorrect) points.Another example would be Steven Pinker\'s The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person\'s Guide to Writing in the 21st Century (a book I recommend reading to learn more about writing). Omitting the intro, Steven doesn\'t reference himself directly but he does base his arguments in facts and knowledge he\'s accumulated. #3 is harder to find because most people write on the backs of others. Only the most abstract philosophical writing falls in this category but that stuff is so dense it\'s not useful. Here are 2 examples which come close to being abstract:Milan Kundera\'s The Art of the Novel contains a few of these essays, although he references himself as the author, he focuses on philosophical abstraction. The Depreciated Legacy of Cervantes is particularly good. This book might appeal to you as a writer as well. Kundera is an immensely thoughtful and self-aware person, a master of self-expression.My second example for this abstractness is Colin Wilson\'s 1956 classic The Outsider. A long essay about alienation, creativity and the modern mind. It explores the concept of one who - for a variety of reasons - views society from without. I responded to the content as a writer, but the Essay structure is also good and informative.Personally, I try to fight against thinking of Essay as "a literary genre of anything non-fiction." I would argue Quora answers are not remotely essays (not even this one). The author has to expand to multiple points before it can be rich enough to be an essay, at best they are reports or articles. Medium, however, is more prone to essay writing, and very good ones at that. (Although Quora does have Essayists, like our much-admired Chloe Shani Malveaux who approaches every answer with thoughtful, didactic and reasoned Essay on not just the question asked but the implications surrounding it. Jon Davis is another Essayist).In my mind an Essay is thoughtful writing that dances around an issue, presenting its attributes and points/counterpoints in an effort to fully engage thoughtful, open minds and bring all of us to a new level of thought or awareness. An essay accepts it might not be the defining argument/viewpoint, but it presents the best reasoned argument as it occurs to the author. It shows the hand of the author, as necessary support or to indicate possible biases.Figure out what you want your Essay to be (and not be) and it will be much easier to write it consistently and coherently.In the mean time, how do you improve your essay-writing skills?Take time to read either the examples I mentioned, especially Pinker and Kundera to know how the genre has progressed and changed and just how much latitude there can be. Find subjects that interest you, keep in mind the best ones will be conceptual, i.e. don\'t look for essays on soldiers, look for essays on bravery, valor, patriotism, selflessness, citizenry etc. Check out www.brainpickings.org/ for reviews of Essays, Letters, Notes, Confessions etc.. Search by terms and buy the books that interest you.Next I\'d buy a few copies of the excellent, curated annual collection, The Best American Essays. The collection started in 1986, the last 10 years are online. Each year contains about 2o essays that vary in personal voice and topic but are all imminently readable. Lately they\'ve tended to be Essay type #1 but that\'s modern writing for you, everything has to be personal.As you read them, ask these questions:1) What is author\'s conceptual premise and how overtly is it stated?2) How are counterpoints or views presented and are they resolved? 3) Why nature of facts or beliefs does the author use to support her conclusions (theory, data, argument)4) Who is the audience, does it matter? 5) What level of personal anecdote is involved, is it too much/too little? The ones you gravitate towards are the ones you should emulate. These questions are to help you figure out why you like them.Finally, on the craft of Essay writing, I\'ve found these helpful (I\'ll add more as I read more);William Zinsser\'s On Writing Well. I think is 30 yrs old and still kicking. C. S. Lakin\'s The Fiction Writer\'s Handy Guide to Grammar, Punctuation, and Word Usage it says "fiction" but it\'s universally useful.I wouldn\'t recommend instruction manuals. You are much too talented for form essay and you will most certainly be limited by it.'

S' How do you make science content interesting and appealing to people with non-science background?Excellent question. First, your content is fine. You answered the question. Anyone who has ever asked "Why do soldiers . . . " will be pleased with your answer (I would implement Koyel Bandyopadhyay\'s suggested changes).But what you haven\'t done, is make it accessible to people who haven\'t asked this question. That\'s what you need to work on and what I\'ll address.If you want to be widely read - or indeed noticed - in the highly-competitive and saturated world of online content you have two options;a) write click-bait crap that gives people fuzzy happy thoughts about themselves and their world OR b) turn insightful, technical content into something more broadly appealing.Option A is as nourishing as white bread. So we\'ll focus on Option B.1. Don\'t restrict your answer to the question asked. The question asks about soldiers, bridges - meh. What else is this about? Physics being more powerful than man? Engineering affecting us in ways we can\'t explain or notice? Military solutions that affect the ways we live our lives? Or perhaps a paradox: When soldiers misstep over bridges they are actually preventing the bridge from collapsing.Reframe it to address a bigger issue.. For example, you\'ll notice my answer doesn\'t restrict itself to your question, if I had I\'d have just edited your answer directly. Instead, I wrote something hopefully useful for anyone who\'s wanted to make the technical more broadly appealing.2. Entice readers and make them care using proven techniques of science education. What attracts non-science people to science-related content? Like all people; learning and being entertained. It\'s your job to teach as they like to learn and entertain as they like to be entertained. It\'s not hard, use your empathy and reference what works. Here are a few methods:a) Present a problem/phenomenon and debunk/solve it. Like the popular show MythBusters. This show starts with something we\'ve heard about (the episode below debunks the Moon Landing videos) or that sounds unbelievable, and then systematically test the myth.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...This method captures our natural curiosity, curiosity we all had as children but lost as science got more technical and thus exclusionary.You don\'t need a production budget. When you\'re writing, lead with the interesting thing. Show a video of soldiers and say "why are they marching like this?" or mention the Millennium Bridge and then tell us (through the rest of the answer) why this happened. Peak our interests and natural inclination to understand that which we do not.b) Lead your audience through the discovery process. Just because I don\'t have a science background doesn\'t mean I want to be patronized by those who do. When I\'m given a result backed up by some equation, it\'s not fulfilling and it is off-putting. I want to know why and see it for myself.Shows like How It\'s Made and Bill Nye, the Science Guy (TV Series 19931998) were able to capture audiences because they show process. In writing, this is easy to do. Walk us through HOW IT WORKS. Perhaps ask us to imagine we are on the bridge and what we might feel and see and then tell us why. Add visuals, videos, links etc. so we can see how this works.c) Add a human drama to something that seems inhuman. This would be the Bear Grylls school of teaching science. Why is Bear Grylls so popular? Because of Bear Grylls.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...He is surviving, he is frustrated, fearful, worried, anxious, passionate. We care about him - THAT is the drama. When he eats sheep eyes it\'s a lovely bonus. Why does the bridge/soldier issue matter? Has anyone died? Do they march in a different way because of it? What is the human drama? The Broughton story is great: "In 1831 the British Army collapsed a bridge in Broughton simply by walking over it. What resulted was a change in how armies to this day walk across bridges." Humans & history was affected, that\'s interesting.d) Show us you care and infect us with your enthusiasm. Physicist Richard Feynman was excellent at this and thus, quite accessible to everyone, not just science-minds. He coined the phrase "A kick in the discovery" his term for finding something new and original. This phrase, as well as much of his writing, tells us much about who he is and how much he cares. When we understand and care about him, we understand and care about what he\'s telling us. You could add a personal story of your own related to the issue (I was on a bridge once and this is what happened). Put yourself and your passion into your writing. If we\'re going to listen to you, we have to know you. 3. Maintain empathy for your audience in your tone, words and examples. What does your audience react to? Try to minimize specific-speak that can be confusing or off-putting. Link to Wikipedia. Use metaphors or similes. Draw connections "the give of a bridge that allows for this movement is the same give that allows massive trucks to drive across or the force that can make us fly off a trampoline when someone else is bouncing on it" (I made up that science but you get my point).We all speak different technical languages, being aware of your own and how it sounds will help you speak to more people.4. Ok, MOST IMPORTANT - Now that you\'ve read all I\'ve said, take a step back and decide is this really how you want to write? It\'s 100% up to you how you write and for what purpose: to further scientific knowledge, to answer specific questions, to engage people in new concepts. Think about it. Why are you here? What do you hope to accomplish? What do you hope to give to others?I assumed you wanted to reach non-science people because that was your question, but are you sure about that? To what extent? Good luck, whatever you do, I hope you keep writing. :)'

S" Yes, it is a terrific idea to read fiction while you write fiction. I'm doing it now. Writing without proximate fiction is like writing with half my mind. Inconceivable.I'm working on a short-story about friendship. Next to me I have a cat (incidental but I thought I'd mention him because he's my friend thus muse) a couple books with stories that involve friendship in childhood, two books that involve coming-of-age stories, and one book that is about friendship and loss in adulthood.These books are not stacked in the manner of a cat-fort. Although he'd like that. No, they are for me, to help me write.Reading while I write helps me improve technical aspects of my writing.1. Avoid cliches.Everyone else mentioned this and it is TRUE. The last thing I want is to fall back on elements that have been used to within an inch of their life. Friends that are complete opposites in nature but somehow understand each other, hmm bit overdone. Friendship that is a ballast against evil not as common but pretty obviously LOTR. Friendship that doesn't survive into adulthood, pretty common. And so on.2. Develop richer themes.What themes relate to friendship? Story 1 talks about betrayal. Story 2 talks about jealousy. Story 3 talks about power. Story 4 about loss. All these themes circulating the rich topic of friendship prompts me to consider what I think about friendship. Is it a transaction? Is it selfish in nature? Can it still exist once our innocence is lost? What is its relation to eros love? Does it have to be reciprocated? What are its lasting benefits and when do you see them most clearly, once it's gone?Had I not simultaneously consulted this other material, my own writing would have been flat and characters without values or motivators.3. Triggers memory-rich primary content (MRPC)I made up this acronym to mean my actual memories which I pop into the stories from time to time to give the scenes color and authenticity. My memories are triggered by reading, never writing. Because when reading, I'm expanding; when writing, I'm narrowing.Most important, however, reading while I write provides crucial mental and emotional rejuvenation.Writing is the act of pulling, extracting, building, tearing down, rebuilding. It feels violent and disruptive. Through this process by which we find and expose ourselves we ultimately produce something remarkable (one hopes) but to do so we must constantly fight against the process and the fear and impatience it engenders.Reading, however, is the opposite. In reading we turn ourselves over, surrender, passing agency to someone else. It is patience. It is gratitude. It is imagination extended. In its nourishing comfort I find strength to return to the toil of my own violent and disruptive work.No one can build the bridge on which I cross my life(1), nor by which I enter and slug through the yardage that is my relationship to writing. But reading can give me a cat to carry and maybe an umbrella when it rains. My writing wouldn't be much without either of those.1 Nietzsche on How to Find Yourself and the True Value of Education)"

S' Writing like you talk is a good idea, writing as you talk (i.e. without editing) is not.Good, modern writing (for non-specialized purposes) should be AUTHENTIC and CLEAR.To be authentic, good practice is to write without jargon, esoteric vocab, rhetoric or pomposity. How familiar a tone you use will depend on your audience, but personally I prefer to read something that has a more formal than an overly-familiar tone. Familiarity is often cheesy. Checking your work by asking "could I actually hear myself saying that?" is a great way to make sure it is authentic.To be clear, good practice is to use minimal adverbs, adjectives, prepositions, objects and other aspects of speech that can confuse your reader or obfuscate your meaning.We all think and thus talk differently. Depending on how clear you think and thus talk, you\'ll want to do varying levels of editing. We all have to edit.I write exactly as I think because I\'m a clear thinker. So yes, I write how I would talk. Except it\'s not exactly how I talk. After I write, I edit. I remove useless speech patterns, replace vocab, and improve the flow so my meaning is clearer. I call it de-cluttering.For example;It comes out of my head looking like this.Except it\'s not exactly how I would talk. After I write anything, I edit it many times. Among other things, I remove and replace useless words and phrases that are usually from my speech patterns and aren\'t necessary to what you\'re reading.After 4-5 rounds of edits, it becomes this;Except it\'s not exactly how I talk. After I write, I edit. I remove useless speech patterns, replace vocab, and improve the flow so my meaning is clearer. Because both the original and the final version sound like something I might say, the small adjustments to make it clearer on the page don\'t detract from the authenticity.So yes, write as you talk - with a lot of editing to tidy it up.'

S" Don't live your life in fear of sunk costs.Don't be afraid of wasted time or stepping off a ladder you don't want to be climbing.Many people hurry to figure out who they are, and who they aren't. This reaches a frenzy around your age. People talk definitively. People at the end of their 20s talk the most definitively and thus it feels everyone has it figured out and you have to too. You stop wherever you are and announce to the world;THIS IS WHO I AM AND THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO DO!!!Done. And that is that. Except, that isn't that. If you think this way at 28, you will spend your 30s reinforcing what you've decided at 28 rather than reevaluating your more mature self and its needs.At 31 you'll feel a nagging doubt but you shrug it off because it's a tickle and YOU have it figured out. You made a plan at 28. You take comfort in that.At 35 the tickle starts to be a scratch, and the doubt gets bigger but you still shrug it off because well, you've come so far, it's all about sunk costs. But you might start drinking.At 40 the scratch becomes a full-on rash and you are suffering, what you have is not what you want and you realize your life at 40 has been taken hostage by what your 28 year old self thought was the answer because you were afraid of not having an answer. At 45, that is when the crisis hits. Emotional shingles. All over body-pain that is overwhelming and you realize you're stuck. You implode. You have an affair or two, a face-lift, new car, maybe an ulcer, lots of whiskey and you start sabotaging your life because you just want out. Or you keep your head down and keep going because the people who depend on you are more important than your happiness.Either way, you're not happy.You don't know at 28 what your 31, 35, 40, 45 self wants. Plan for long-term and make investments by, all means. But also check, recheck and don't be afraid to start over and step off ladders (or bubbles), even if it means wasted time - if it will make you happy.It's your life and you only get one chance.

S' You should well ask and I know why you did, because in this answer I tell everyone to fail.(Except I didn\'t mean GO FAIL, I meant, GO SUCCEED without being afraid of failing.)I digress. Good question. I always feared after that post, people who read it were out there, failing, without a clue how to bounce back. It kept me up at night.And yet it took me weeks to answer this A2A because my immediate thoughts were - not joking - But, I\'ve never failed!That\'s right, I\'VE NEVER FAILED.  I haven\'t. Not really.Not in the way people talk about it today. I\'ve done wrong, messed up, made mistakes. Some big, some bigger, some Texas-sized.But I\'ve nothing in common with the ubiquitous failure porn writers who treat failure as a series of colossal external events - over which they have no control - which for some reason happened to them and now they carry the failure around like badge of honor or a mark of Cain and that makes them great - just having failed.I don\'t wear failure badges. I just have me, the product of my failures.My failures aren\'t external or things that happen to me. They are things I did. And thus, they become me. I\'m responsible for them and I could have prevented them (if I\'d wanted to). I\'ve always believed this, a product of parents with high expectations. This belief grants me power and responsibility.Responsibility because it means that I have to own my failures and push myself to face what I could have done. Saying "I FAILED" is bullshit and it will do nothing for you. It\'s like Grade 1 self-awareness. Great, you can say you failed. So what? "I FAILED AND HERE\'S WHY . . . " that is tough. Commendable. That\'s what I go for.Facing what I could have done isn\'t easy, I process failure pretty thoroughly. I look at process, effort, desire, details, strategy - every aspect. I process at it so thoroughly, it\'s digestive.It\'s almost like I eat my failures. Sounds weird. But that\'s the process. I cut them up, slather on the sauce (usually beer, real beer, not metaphorical beer), and chew and digest and once I\'ve extracted all the protein, calcium, magnesium and other fine goodness that my body needs, you know, you s*^t the rest and move on.I ate a burger two nights ago, couldn\'t tell you where it is now. Parts of it I\'m using in my cells, parts of it I left behind. It doesn\'t exist as a burger.Same with failures. They don\'t stick with me as things because that means I haven\'t broken them down and used them. Say I lost $1M. If I keep talking about having lost $1M and fixate on that (which on it\'s own means nothing) rather than all the events that lead up to it and past it.. . I\'m stuck. I don\'t grow.Failure is an inflection point, not a badge.You have to step off the inflection point and move on. It\'s a steep drop but it\'s also a new beginning which is exciting. Take time to process the emotions but don\'t let them take over. Digest your failures, get the nourishment they can provide, and you will achieve great power. I don\'t carry failures around as such, but their residue is in everything I write, communicate, think and say. They are part of me. That\'s where the power comes from. I believe I can do most anything that I want and I have myself to blame if I don\'t.I wrote an answer telling people to fail because it is important part of growing and developing. One shouldn\'t fear failure. But you don\'t have to fail in order to learn about yourself and grow, it\'s just one of the many ways to mature and develop.But if you do fail, don\'t wear it as a badge, it doesn\'t make you special. Eat it and use it.'

S' Neither. Both are bad ideas because they create cliche, clutter and distraction.But you do bring up a dilemma, which I see as:"How do you show continued (secondary) action* or traits in a way that they remain in the readers mind without being repeated?"That is a great question, common problem. Here is how: 1. Trust your reader - don\'t repeat. We\'re smarter than you think. If you say \'he flashed his gums when he smiled\' we\'ll picture it and remember it. If you say "he flashed his gums" once in a scene, we know he\'s upset and we will remember that. We get it. 2. Separate your characters\' behaviors between characteristics and actions and call attention to them as needed.A CHARACTERISTIC (or common behavior) is something that happens always because it is the character. Example: John smiled so wide he was more gum than tooth.That\'s visual, we\'ll remember. You don\'t have to remind us after your original description. If you feel this is critical to the character (although I don\'t know why it would be) and we might forget by page 300, have another character comment on it.An ACTION (uncommon behavior) is something that happens once (or several times in a scene but only in a scene) and is thus significant, a departure of our normal visual of this character. You should describe it.Example: He flashed his red gums at me. I.e. he sneered (I assume?)This was necessary because he\'s not always sneering. Tells me the guy is angry. Or is he smiling? Ah, to my next point.. . 3. Don\'t use long descriptions when simple ones will do.(I\'m picking on your examples here, yes, forgive me.) He sneered is MUCH clearer than He flashed his red gums at me.I hear the former, I think \'yup, dude\'s upset. Probably at the narrator.\' Got it. Ohhhh, wonder what happens next?The latter has me wondering \'Is he\'s smiling? Sneering? Why are his gums red, does he not take care of them? Is he afraid of dentists? Why is he afraid of dentists?\' Did he have a bad experience? Why? . . so on.I\'m distracted from the main point; this dude is upset. Sure, you might proceed in the next lines to tell me all about his phobia of drills and shots and yes, Ellen, he IS afraid of dentists. And this might be really well-written and detailed and well-researched except I\'m going to be sitting there thinking (possibly yelling):WHY DOES THIS MATTER? FUCK DENTISTS!! I HATE THIS AUTHOR!If you don\'t need to say more than "He sneered" don\'t. Lengthy descriptions with no value distract the reader and increase the risk of inadvertently using a cliches like these.4. Nevertheless, sometimes action DOES need to be repeated because its repetition is intrinsic to the scene/story. Actions that show a character\'s anxiety or unrest, for example, should be mentioned. But usually, once is enough;Harry started running his hands through his hair while he tried to answer my question. She noticed that Harry had a quite disturbing tendency to run his fingers through his hair when he was nervous. I couldn\'t breath but for the noise of Harry running his goddam fingers through his motherfucking hair.Or the more direct approach, put it in dialog"If you don\'t stop running your fingers through you hair I\'m going to hit you with a frying pan!" She screamed,; her red gums flashing. So, in sum. Don\'t repeat. If you have to repeat, do it simply and subtly only as much as you need and if it adds to what is most important in the scene.*I made up this phrase. Secondary action means like chewing, spitting, shaking etc. Primary action is running, slapping, screaming. I don\'t know, like I said, I made it up.'

S' I don\'t know how old you are, but from this question, I\'d say you have a healthy maturity of someone I\'d want to talk to and spend time with. Which would make you, in my book, a grown-up. What makes me say this?You wrote a clear, precise question that shows intelligence.Your question suggests self-awareness - a hallmark of maturity and something rarely seen in people even in their 30s, 40s etc.Rather than ask a specific such as "why am I not learning," or "why am I not acting appropriately," you summarize your issues in the conceptual term "growing up" which demonstrates your ability to have perspective.Your pose a question that - on first glance - renders you vulnerable to people thinking less of you, and yet you do it anyway, which suggests you have a confidence.You might not be where you want to be in all things, no one is. But your question intimates that you possess key aspects of maturity: knowledge, self-awareness, perspective, and confidence.Don\'t be too hard on yourself. Growing up is a state of mind. Perhaps yours just needs a re-calibration.'

S' You might suffer from what\'s called The Tyranny of the Final Product.*Writers - self included - are intimidated by a desire to write the final say on the most interesting thing that has never been said and to make it perfect.This gives your final product power, too much power, tyrannical power. And like most tyrannies - creativity dies from fear of failure.Here is the secret, make this your mantra:ONLY WRITE ABOUT THINGS THAT INTEREST YOU.Yes, you. Just you. Not your spouse or teacher or dog or your self 5 years from now. Just your self today, this week. That\'s it. Do this always, for as long as you write. Why? Here\'s why:1. Readers don\'t know what they care about until they read it. You have a LOT more latitude than you think. Ignore trends, if something is trending, you\'ve missed it. Trends weren\'t always trends, at some point they were someone\'s original thought.Do you think people in 1965 were sitting around thinking "Gawsh, could do with a story about mass murder of a family in the heart of the Midwest." Hardly. Truman Capote wrote In Cold Blood because the story was interesting to him, he made it interesting to us.Yeah, (you say) but Ellen, that\'s a story about murder. It\'s bound to be interesting. You\'d be right. Except....2. If you write well, you can make anything interesting. One of my favorite authors is Robin Lane Fox. He is the Head Gardener for University of Oxford and writes a weekly column in the Financial Times and wrote Thoughtful Gardening. I garden, so naturally, it was literary butter for me. That\'s not why I mention it. My husband (a guy who I send to the garden for herbs and he returns EVERY SINGLE TIME with cuttings from each herbaceous plant EXCEPT herbs - I should cook geranium stems to teach him a lesson) also loved the book. Because it is superbly well-written.3. If you don\'t care, we won\'t care. Good writing doesn\'t just start well and end well, or have a good story, or humor or insight - it has an author\'s voice. An author\'s confidence and enthusiasm. Get excited about what you are writing about - whatever it is - and we\'ll get excited.Ok (now you say) but Ellen, what if nothing interests me? Really? Nothing is interesting? Then do us a favor - don\'t write a blog.Too many people want to have written a book, or to have published a blog, they don\'t want to actually write. Their ratio of time spent writing vs. time spent marketing is 1:20. And they produce crap.Don\'t be this person who wants to have written. Be someone who wants to write.Care about something, find things interesting, dig deep until you do and enjoy writing, at least a little bit. See, now that we\'ve had this discussion (I imagine us having tea and chatting. Maybe because I\'m drinking tea now) I think there are a lot of interesting things around you, and I think you find many things interesting. And I think YOU are interesting. Perhaps you just need a little nudge. Here is a nudge to find that interesting thing.1. Narrow your scope. Don\'t tackle massive themes or sweeping time frames. Rather than tell us the story of all the immigrants on Ellis Island, tell the story of one. Ok, that was cliche, here\'s another example. Rather than telling us about dogs. Write about your dog. Or rather than writing about your dog, write about your dog in the morning. Or rather than writing about your dog in the morning, write about your dog THIS morning. That\'s how you narrow. 2. Focus on the human element. The most interesting part of every interesting story are the humans. What they think, why they think. Find them, winkle them out, make them the story. Do interviews, interviews are amazing.3. Give yourself permission to suck. Going back to the Tyranny of the final product - your goal isn\'t a good article, or even 10 good articles. Your goal is to be A GOOD WRITER WHO KEEPS IMPROVING. In 6 months, your goal might change, your goal might be to develop a kick ass portfolio. Fine. But right now, starting out, focus on the craft. Focus on the writing.4. Give yourself permission to be good. There is something about writing that makes one modest. Everyone is doing it. Everyone is a writer. Everyone has a blog. You haven\'t published anything yet.... yadda. Wrong. Be good. Be a rockstar. You will get better if you think, read, write deliberately and you will have to face this. When it happens, embrace it and run with it.You can do it. Check back in 6 months. If you get stuck, PM me. I\'m good with idea development. I\'m blunt though. And I demand tea. *On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction, William Zinsser: Books by William Zinsser, Chapter 22 in particular. Excellent book.A few more resources:- What are the best books on writing?How can I improve my writing skills?Where can I find writing prompts?'

Every politician is slick, every banker is soulless. Journalists are moral and hardworking. Teachers are worn out. Every woman is unsatisfied, every man is flippant. Mothers are worn out too, but the fathers are emotionless. Every woman has jet black hair and every day starts with bitter coffee (which might also be scorching) and ends with whiskey (who drinks whiskey?) and ice that clinks. (Or is it chinks?

Lots of blaring lights which sometimes flicker.The country has chirping crickets and waving grass. Parched earth abounds, there is lots and lots and lots of dust. The moon is always bathing things, the fog is always thick or dense, sometimes both. Thunderstorms rage while thunder cracks. Lighting illuminates, what, I don't know. The sun shines down, as opposed to up, and clouds really don't do anything except move.Waves crash. Cars don't.Tears roll down cheeks and faces break into smiles while the eyes always crinkle, when they aren't sparkling, or flashing. Hair shines or curls, always curls. People are clad in clothing, never just clothed in it. Necklaces dangle and bracelets chink. Arms are thick and strong and eyes meet more than people.Thoughts race or sometimes pervade while anger boils. Chills run up or down spines, depending on where you live, and ideas aren't just clear, they are crystal clear. What is crystal? It's what you drink your whiskey in. With the ice that clinks.Things are notably pale, thick, greasy, cold, strong and dry which don't need to be. If it's a pillow we know it's soft. Ditto Coke and cold. Words like eat and ran and speak are passed over for gobbled and raced and exclaimed. People can't just hold they have to clasp, they can't cry they have to sob and they can't stop they have to come to a halt. I'm not tired, I'm fatigued. I'm not messy, I'm disheveled.

S' Fictional characters can be judged, and they HAVE to be judged. What is the point of literature if not to hold up archetypes of humanity and reflect them in detail so that we might judge and learn?I say it\'s the truest hallmark of great writing when we can judge characters fairly because they were created perfectly by the author, notwithstanding the author\'s premises.Fictional characters can be judged as humans IF the author has done his job correctly and made his hand invisible.As long as a character\'s persona is developed and he does things that are consistent with his formation, self-awareness, needs, motivations and weaknesses (not necessarily predictable in terms of plot, but predictable in terms of character) then he should be judged.Darth Vader can be judged for killing the Emperor because his action was plausible, i.e. consistent with his character. It wasn\'t a deus ex machina or random hand of the writer to make the plot work. The story suggested his ultimate salvation earlier and then made good on it ultimately. It was a surprise yes but plausible, nonetheless.Is this the gesture of a total monster? Up to you.Another great example is Lord of the Flies, an viscous, dystopian novel that depicts the descent into barbarism of a group of young boys abandoned on a deserted island. In the absence of basic needs like food and shelter, the children\'s efforts at an ordered society fall apart and they turn murderous.In this case, we can judge the characters. Golding produced enough evidence in the situation to suggest that knowing what we know about these boys, this could happen.Golding doesn\'t ask us to believe his premise, he asks that IF we accept the premise, then to accept that this scenario might be the likely outcome. Whether or not we think the boys are innately evil or buy Golding\'s premise that their actions are more likely the product of class systems and neglectful parenting, is up to us, the readers. One could argue either way, and the fact that they are children is important, of course, but still, we\'re judging the characters.But regardless, in this case, the moral question of whether they are guilty ceases to be a question of fiction (i.e. is it conceivable that these characters acted this way) and becomes one of sociology, philosophy, biology etc.. (i.e. why did such characters act in this way.)So yes, characters should be judged, as archetypes or even individuals.  - EXCEPT - when they are victims of bad writing. "I\'m not bad, my author made me do it!".Characters should NOT be judged if their actions the result of poor character development or laziness on the part of the author. If a character acts inconsistently, given the information we have from the author, then it\'s not fair to judge the character.Cristina Hartmann\'s answer What classic literary works do not deserve to be considered such? argues that Jane Eyre fails because the main character acts incongruously of what we\'d expect in so many ways that in fact, it almost isn\'t Jane\'s fault when she makes the choices she makes, it\'s her authors\'. (I\'m more direct about this than Cristina is, I blame Charlotte Bronte entirely :).)Another example is Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn. I dislike this book. Sure it\'s easy to read and the plot was catchy, but the characters were horrible. I found myself baffled by their choices, unable to find their real motivations and hating them for being so erratic. As a result, I hated, I mean HATED the two main characters. Then I reread it. I don\'t think it is their fault. Nick and Amy - not their fault they were so erratic. Amy was driven to kill because her author needed her to. There was no other way to show her complete downfall and make us not see her as a victim. I maintain that there was not nearly enough compelling information that she would have been so maniacal or masochistic OR that she wouldn\'t have just killed her parents. Same goes for Nick, he was wholy inconsistent and unbelievable. That is bad character development, plan and simple. I blame the author.'

S' An accent is one way to show authenticity of a character, it isn\'t and shouldn\'t be the only way. (To understand how to use accents check out: Dan Smith\'s answer to How do authors differentiate accents of different characters in a novel?)Don\'t write in accent because you find writing in Cockney English interesting and/or fun - your readers will hate you..If you want to make a character authentic, there are a few ways to do it;If you are writing about an outsider, personal journey or alienation theme, it makes sense to use full- on accents. I.e., Character 1 comes to another place and meets Character 2 with whom he doesn\'t have much in common, you might want to make Character 2 have an accent to reinforce the differences. My favorite - James Herriot\'s books, All Creatures Great and Small, where he includes the Yorkshire accent to show the difficulty he had understanding them, how different he felt as an outsider. He continued to write the accents in his books and they became almost loving.Another example, of course, is Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) where both Jim and Huck have an accent as a way of showing their race, class and education differences (and similarities).Otherwise, you can mention how the accent/pronunciation sounds to your protagonist without actually writing it out; - He pronounced his words like he had chewed them around- Her staccato pace and clipped words made him think of an automated cheese slicer.- He spoke in long vowels and drawn-out syllables, like he didn\'t want to cede the floor and needed to bide his time.Describe them thus, but write out their dialog in a traditional manner, occasionally using vernacular like Ga\'awww or y\'all or you\'uns when appropriate. You can also develop rich character voices that will say as much about your character as an accent would; i.e. grammar, syntax, pacing, style that would suit them.  - Do they Eh and Um- Do they have excellent/poor grammar? - Do they interrupt themselves? - Would they say Don\'t be late, Be here on time, or Please, be punctual? What about colloquialisms? Alice Munro writes about the The Midwest and her characters speak exactly like the people I grew up around (phrases like Oh, dear, starting sentences with Why). She doesn\'t write their elongated o\'s and a\'s but I can hear them.Another great example is Kazuo Ishiguro\'s Remains of the day narrated in the formal tone of a Butler.I told the man I would have to be on my way and thanked him emphatically for his assistance.In this case, the tone and vernacular is absolutely necessary because it shows the repressed emotions central to the theme. Show the character doing, saying, wearing, thinking things that are part of their culture and heritage.Barbara Kingsolver always handles ethnicity and culture with respect. "Uncle Ledger would say, once you\'ve ridden a horse, you should know what a horse is." from Pigs in Heaven Uncle Ledger is Native American and from the central plains of the U.S., Kingsolver doesn\'t mention an accent, but the way he speaks of a culture that knows and understands horses - as many people including Native Americans living in the Plains do - you can more easily hear a voice that might belong to him.Be careful not to make characters cliche. A Native American who only talks about animals and spirits is a cliche (not to mention racist). One that mentions such a phrase as above, and then goes on to be a fully-developed character in his own right, is not.'

S' Fiction has more POVs than you can shake a stick due to the combination of characters and what insight we\'re allowed for each. It\'s not as simple as 1st, 2nd, 3rd.. . THAT BEING SAID - I\'m going to shake that stick at the most COMMON POVs because they are what you\'ll use most.This is my view (haha) of different POVs and when to use them.1. 1st PERSON NARRATIONWhat is it?"I" (the main character) am the narrator: I saw this, I said, I felt.... Everyone else and everything that happens is related to the reader through my personal lens. This is a unique approach because the reader gets full access to the character\'s self-awareness or lack there of. We readers see first hand what is going on in the protagonist\'s mind. When self-awareness, or lack there of, is a component of the theme, 1st person works well.Example: I felt sad. Susie looked at me, she looked confused. Jane shivered when she looked at me, she was probably angry. We know what the narrator feels, and what he notices the others do and what he thinks they feel.Considerations for using this narrative perspective:- Bonds the reader to the main character because there is no narrative distance between reader and character. - Empowers the reader to make his/her decisions about the character. You, the reader, feel this person is talking to you, you alone get to decide what you feel about him, no 3rd person tells you about him.- Remember, however, that the character might be an unreliable narrator, if this is the point, make it very clear so readers understand- It creates an immediacy of the story. This story is now, happening, important, and critical, thus, I - character - am stepping out of my "life" to tell it. - It only conveys as much as the character sees or understand. Things that happen outside of his awareness can\'t be relayed unless the author drops the pretense and switches to 3rd person, a trick often overused.- It can be difficult to write. All characters exist as the narrator sees them. Which means while they have their own voice, syntax, personas, those all must be filtered through the narrators view, not full-on. Dialog gets around this but again, it\'s often overused. - Do we want to spend this much time with this narrator? It might not be kind of person we can listen to for an entire book. People often complain about Catcher because of this, mistaking Holden\'s immature narration as a causality of bad writing.- It\'s difficult for new authors not to put their own voice into the characters. The character needs to have their own consistent vernacular and personality.- Rare, but what if your character dies? Story stops. Unless you pick it up with someone else or 3rd person but that is a big shift in the book.Examples of books that use 1st person narration well- The Catcher in the Rye (1951) is perhaps the best example. The immediacy of Holden\'s feelings, his reactions, his vernacular, his limitations is the theme of the book. Kerouac\'s On the Road (1951) in 1st person for similar reasons and works extremely well. Neither would have been as poignant in 3rd person.- Of course, if your character is a psychotic, deranged killer, you almost have to use first person, see Bret Easton Ellis\' American Psycho. Good example of a unreliable narrator.- Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley uses 3 different 1st person POV, nestled like Russian dolls, It allows the reader to sympathize with each character.(although believing that one character can perfectly recall another\'s words so exactly requires suspension of disbelief.) Technically, this is also an alternating narrative because it switches narrators.2. 3rd PERSON NARRATION (intimate)What is it?Story is not narrated directly from any direct perspective, but it is intimate with at least one main character\'s thoughts and feelings and what he/she notices and thinks. First person would say "I felt sick." 3rd person "He felt sick."This is the most common, and most easily employed type. Example: John felt sad. Susie gave him a confused look. Jane, shivered when she saw John\'s face.  We only know what John thinks, but we have actions that suggest what Susie and Jane think.Considerations for using this narrative perspective- The more removed we are from a characters mind, the easier it is to add texture to the stories; things like scenery, atmosphere, mood, motifs etc. Long scenery descriptions in first person are weird, because most individuals don\'t survey scenery to the extent a 3rd person narrator would.- Allows for richer characters due to multiple points of view, reactions, thoughts and motivations.- Similarly, can add tension because reader can more clearly see the emotions of fear and anger - as well as situation irony that lead to tension. - Often it is easier for authors to write because not every line has to be in the main character\'s syntax and vernacular. - There are many subtle variations on this POV style; you might be in the heads of 1 person and make them the de facto narrator (like 1st person POV but slightly removed), or perhaps 5 people - each one drawn out and complex.- Careful not to go into too many heads at once. Knowing what each and every person is thinking actually creates emotional distanceExamples of books that use 3rd person narration well- The Children Act, Ian McEwan\'s latest is in limited (and unreliable) 3rd person, the Judge, but only her thoughts and feelings are known and everyone else is seen by her. Fitting for her character as she struggles to comprehend the emotions and needs of others.- J.M. Coetzee\'s Disgrace is similarly inside the head of 1 character. The 3rd person allows for atmospheric descriptions and pacing and tone that wouldn\'t have worked in 1st person. At the same time, we\'re so intimate with the protagonist\'s thoughts that it achieves the best effects of 1st person narration. 3. 3rd PERSON OMNISCIENT NARRATIONWhat is it?Omniscient narration is a 3rd person narrative but without a primary character. Instead, the narration knows the thoughts and feelings of MOST OR ALL the characters.Example: John felt sad. Susie looked at him, confused if he was sad or mad. Jane felt cold when she saw John\'s face. Here, we know what everything is thinking, and it\'s a bit much.Considerations for using this narrative perspective- Can cause whiplash if too many heads are explored at once; create a break between what character x thinks and character y. - Is there a protagonist - at least one someone the reader can identify or care about?- Needs consistency, Character x\'s thoughts can\'t be open to us in one part and opaque in another. - This is very hard to achieve consistently throughout the entire book. Most authors break up perspectives by chapter rather than having them all in one scene. So while each chapter is a 3rd person intimate, the entire book has the effect of 3rd person omniscient.Examples of books that use Omniscient narration well- Cormac McCarthy\'s The Road - This narration briefly jumps into the head of the boy and the man. Because it doesn\'t jump very deep into either, it works and the reader is emotionally bonded to both of them (critical in a book where everything else is so alienating.) He also employs a lot of dialog, showing what the characters feel rather than telling. 1st person would have been much too immediate, too personal and frankly, too warm for the tone of this book.Jane Austen\'s Pride and Prejudice, of course, does this well. Austen allows us to know the thoughts of Elizabeth, Mr. Bennett and a few others. Like McCarthy, Austen hangs back on rambling, penetrating emotional synopsis, however, and presents the characters mainly in dialog - it feels like we are more closely to Eliza than we really are yet we still understand thoughts of most of the characters.4. OTHER NARRATION OPTIONS2nd person - rarely used, is when a character is talking to about himself. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Se...Omniscient (removed) - Ok, I made this up. But I take it to mean when a narrator is removed from everyone\'s head, the reader only knows what people think through actions. So there is no narrator (save Shakespeare\'s Chorus), and you might as well write a drama/play.This answer was how I think about POV in fiction writing, here are some other views (hehe):- Self-Editing for Fiction Writers, a great book written by editors, not authors. Chapter 3 lays out the different options with examples.-Writers Toolbox - How to understand perspective vs. POV and examples of each from an actual writer. 5 Quick Tips for Writing in Multiple Perspectives | WritersDigest.com Writers Digest is usually a good site, this article is about how to write well in multiple perspectives.'

S' (I\'m going to assume you\'re not cheating and that there is no evidence of you cheating that he could point to.)Sometimes people get paranoid and create a "drama" so others will pay attention to them. They are deeply afraid of being left out, forgotten (consider this is why you often see it with the elderly). The paranoia alleviates feelings of loneliness and abandonment. Even though in the long run it has the affect of alienating the very people they seek to connect to. The paranoia he\'s feeling - the idea that you are "cheating" - draws you in and makes you act in a way that is caring about him. Think about it, you deny you\'re cheating, you get mad at him, you emphatically tell him you\'re not cheating and that you love him. He feels like he\'s being noticed.He probably feels excluded from your life because you are working so much. He might feel like you\'ve forgotten him or that you will, soon. These are normal feelings that couples go through and it doesn\'t mean he\'s insecure or crazy or that you are to blame.It just means you need to talk about it and address what is really going on.Don\'t talk to him about his paranoia, talk to him about what he\'s feeling. Remind him that you haven\'t forgotten him, that you love him, that he\'s important to you. Tell him that when he accuses you of cheating, it hurts you and damages your relationship.If he can\'t engage with you on this level, if he still hides behind this "cheating" paranoia, then it might be time to move on. He deserves to feel noticed, but you deserve a partner who will sort through his emotions in a mature way.'

S" You are asking if this POV-based structure (jumping between 1st person Points of View (POV)) is overdone, expected, or boring?The answer is no, not necessarily.That being said, it won't be original or inventive (The Memento boat of innovative structure just for the sake of structure has sailed, don't swim after it), writing a book with a different perspective each chapter ISN'T a book idea. It's a structure/narration idea that you'd employ AFTER you've developed your book/thematic idea. It is also complicated to execute deftly. You might want to consider using a very intimate 3rd person POV rather than 1st person.Sheri Fresonke Harper has great points on things to consider, read her answer.Additional considerations could include:Does each chapter use different perspectives to advance a central plot (House of Sand and Fog: Andre Dubus III), OR is there one plot event and the novel is about retelling that event through different perspectives (What are examples of novels or short stories that use multiple 1st person points of view?).The former is useful for a complicated plot where things happen BECAUSE people aren't aligned. Dubus's novel is exactly that, the lack of empathy these people feel is what drives the plot, thus it dances successfully between two different 1st person POVs.The later is useful for a simpler plot and deeper, richer understanding of the humans involved. You'd use this to demonstrate a theme based on how different or similar people are. The plot becomes a tool to illustrate your theme.How many perspectives do you want? The more you have, the harder it will be to keep them consistent and to make the characters rich, deep and developed. The fewer you have, the more you have to convince the reader that you need these two perspectives and not an omniscient POV which is easier to follow.Either way, I wouldn't use more than two 1st person POVs, it will give your reader whiplash. Any more than 2 and I'd switch to 3rd person POVs.Each character must have a strong, unique voice. Character voice is extremely hard for beginner writers, most of us churn out characters that are variations of our own voices/thoughts. But to do different 1st person POV or even 3rd, you have to differentiate your characters. That means syntax, pace, phrasing, self-awareness, and emotions need to be unique and consistent for each one. And you have to do it subtly so they aren't cliched (see Marcus Geduld's answer).To repeat one of the things Sheri mentioned, because it is crucial - you have to create a character that the reader cares about, invests in, roots or (or against). If you dance around too much, it can be an aggressive way of keeping your reader from connecting or forming their own opinions. Readers will resent you for that. You can also use different POVs to wrap a plot in tension or an emotional mood, rather than move it forward. Perhaps the characters aren't at the same time and place, one comes first to set the stage, and the second one continues with the main story. Amy Tan often does this, specifically The Kitchen God's Wife, starts 1st person POV of the daughter, reflecting on her mother today, then switches to her mother's 1st person POV reflecting on her past. While the POVs aren't synchronized by time they are by theme and emotions."

I vaguely remember meeting him, I think I was opening the fridge at the time. He says today he instantly thought I was cool but dressed poorly. My roommate knew him already and said he was an asshole, but the cool kind of asshole (whatever that means). He was a finance guy so was a bit full of himself. I didn't think much of him until I got to know him. We used to text jokes to each other during class to see if we could make the other person laugh out loud. We had a similar biting sense of humor. I always made him laugh.And then we kept hanging out, laughing and talking, nothing too deep but over time he slowly SLOWLY let me see his kind, loving, tender side and I fell for him.He was in love with me from Day 1. Though he denies it."

S' This answer is more of an act than a line.For this you need 2 guys; a bar or drinking establishment, preferably crowded; and 2 women you\'d like to "pick-up."Guy 1 buys a drink (beer bottle) and goes over near the girls and asks casually "Would you mind holding this, I have to tie my shoe." She looks confused but does. He bends down. Guy 2 jumps into the scene shouting "It\'s a trap!" Grabs the drink (without spilling) and says "Sorry, but you were holding a thermal detonator!!"HAHAHAH!!! Makes me laugh even typing it out.IF you don\'t get arrested and IF they get the reference, they will love it. If not - do you really want to date someone who doesn\'t get this?If rejected, instead of walking away in shame, look at each other and one of you do the hand wave; "These weren\'t the girls we were looking for" Depart gracefully. With drink. And dignity.'

S' There are three lists you need to own/watch to save yourself from almost all* movie ignorance. Or, as you said, to know the "greats."1. Movies to seem interesting and bond casually with people at college/new job/Quora.If you want to sound pop-culturally relevant, hip, interesting, with it to the young folk - go with Noam Kaiser\'s list. It\'s dead on balls accurate.2. Movies to confidently refer to movies as "film" (and back it up when someone at college/new job/Quora calls you on it). I\'ll keep the list short (way, way too short), but I\'m happy to go into detail. These FILMS are great and will be great for a damn long time.Romance: It Happened One Night, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Breakfast at Tiffany\'s, Broken Blossoms, Before Sunrise.Comedy: The General, Big Lebowski, Clerks, Bringing up Baby, Fish Called Wanda, Forrest Gump, Fargo, Some like it HotWar: Bridge on the River Kwai, Schindler\'s List, Apocalypse Now, SniperWesterns: The Searchers, Stagecoach, Unforgiven, No Country for Old MenForeign: (By directors); Bunuel, Almodovar, Renoir, Kurasawa, Bergman, Truffaut, Ozu, Fritz Lang, Herzog, del Toro Drama (and everything else): Citizen Kane, On the Waterfront, Double Indemnity, Raging Bull, Good Fellas, Old Boy, The Fugitive, Network, Godfather I & II, Vertigo, Patton.3. Movies to understand the "quotes" everyone (Americans) use constantly.Did you think I made up the phrase dead on balls accurate? Please. My Cousin Vinny (1992)My husband and I talk in movie quotes. It might be one of the coolest things we do so I\'m going to give you an example:- Talk to me Goose.- You talking to me? I am Spartacus!- It ain\'t cool being no jive turkey this close to Thanksgiving. - I want the truth! - You can\'t handle the truth. - I coulda been a contender! I coulda been somebody. Instead of a bum, which is what I am. - What we got here, is a failure to communicate.- You wanna dance? Or do you want to dance?- You sentimental old fool.- Give him head? - Be a beacon?- That\'s the kind of thing an idiot would have on his luggage!- Obviously you\'re not a golfer.- Follow me, I know the way! Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na- And like that, he\'s gone. Got lost once in his own museum.**(And then we get stuck in Indiana Jones and never make it out.) Relax. You don\'t have to see these movies. Just repeat the quotes at the socially acceptable time. That\'s what everyone does. If you don\'t know any make one up and say it came from Donnie Darko (2001) or Full Metal Jacket (1987). Two movies everyone thinks they should have seen and are usually embarrassed to admit they haven\'t. Have fun! I\'m jealous. There are many movies I wish I could watch for the first time. I should mention that watching these movies won\'t give you a remote comprehensive understanding of film as an art form. But you didn\'t ask for that so, whatever.May the Schwartz be with you!!*You can\'t never fully avoid "Wow, you\'ve never seen XYZ??" So fucking annoying. I told an ex I hadn\'t seen Dune. \'Dune? You\'ve never seen Dune?! How could you not see Dune?\' Yeah well, Dune isn\'t a thing and now neither are we. Annoying. UNLESS the movie in question is the original Star Wars Trilogy and then you should be mocked, nay - thrown into a garbage masher on the detention level, if you haven\'t seen it. SW is the most available, most recognizable and most commonly watched movie of all time. Has there ever been a basement or living room that didn\'t screen it? No. If you\'ve managed to avoid it thus far, you\'re doing it on purpose. And you\'re a shit.**Movie Quote Mashup included: Spaceballs, Thomas Crown Affair, Cool Hand Luke, Trading Spaces, Caddyshack, Usual Suspects, Big Lebowski, Sneakers, Taxi Driver, Sabrina, Top Gun, Heat of the Night, On the Waterfront, Spartacus, Few Good Men'

S" There are many disturbing truths. To me, the most disturbing is how the actual thing is so vastly different than anything it's purported to be.Marriage is not unconditional love.There is hate. Resentment. There is bitterness, isolation, betrayal and pain. I don't feel love for my husband 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Nor does he. Marriage has inertia.There are times when we cannot access our love. Sometimes, it's marriage - not love - that keeps us married. This thing manifest in shared cutlery and mattresses, Thanksgiving rituals and holiday cards - this thing sometimes keeps us together.Marriage is not the agent nor the perfection of you.It doesn't fill your cracks and makes you complete. It's not what you're missing in life. It's not the fulfillment of your true self. Marriage doesn't do anything; it - perhaps - allows you to do things.Marriage is not enough.Marriage is not a signal of success or achievement to the world. I've done this, I'm married, stop worrying, stop doubting. Perhaps for a while, but not for long. Not for ever. The what's next questions persist. And nothing - not even marriage - is immune.Marriage can be a bad thing.Marriage endures beyond lies, beyond broken trust, broken dreams - if you want it to, it can. Marriages - good marriages, ones that work - must exist in dark spaces too, not just the light.Marriage has no baseline.With a few exceptions, there is no standard of what is good, normal, acceptable, and what is not. No one can tell you what to do with it, about it, it is entirely your responsibility to manage your marriage. There is no right answer so don't seek one.Marriage is bigger than you. Bigger than both of you.If my answer sounds like marriage is this mythical thing that cuddles in bed with you and your spouse and at times steals sheets - that's because it is. Well, it's not mythical, but it's there, amorphous. It's the third thing, between you, in your relationship. It's a responsibility, a commitment, a power, an profound intimacy. Ensuring we are seen, witnessed and bound to another before we expire. More than any other social institution we have as humans. (Paying taxes notwithstanding).(If you think I'm overly down on marriage please read any of the 150 or so answers I have written lauding it. You can't feast on the meat without delivering a kill shot. Kapow!)"

S" Because they don't understand and that can turn into judgment. In outgoing cultures, being extroverted is the norm, at least in terms of what you see. Things that are divergent from the norm, are seen as abnormal. Most people just don't know any introverts. And when you are divergent from these people's personal preferences, it can feel even more disconcerting for them. Because it's personal.You're fighting a large battle here - changing the mindsets of all the individuals around you. But you aren't alone. Many, many people have written on introversion. On Quora, in books, etc. Read up and send whatever you find interesting to the people who judge you.Try to separate those who care about you (and are worried because they don't understand and perhaps fear the worst) and those who are just being self-centered and judgmental. Attempt to make the first group understand (I'll talk to them if that would help!) and ignore the second group, as best you can. We all have people who will never understand us. Even extroverts.That being said, above all - make sure you always do what you want for the right reason. Make sure that if you avoid small-talk and interactions, it's because you want to, not because you're rebelling in concept. Introverts, - myself included - have a habit of being overly self-protective because we feel if we don't, no one else will. But sometimes we can do it too much for our own good. Understand yourself - sounds like you're nearly there (bravo!) - then educate others. And find strength in other introverts, we're all going through the same thing."

S' I\'m really good at small talk.Weather. Travel. Food. Downton Abbey. See? Look how interesting I am. Except, I\'m not. Well, I am - but you wouldn\'t know from small talk. You can\'t make yourself interesting in small talk. The nature of small talk is to be UNINTERESTING. Generic. Innocuous. It\'s the method humans have settled on in polite society to create bonds without offending anyone or being vulnerable.I\'m good at small talk because I LOATHE it. And thus, I don\'t let it remain small. If you want to be interesting, learn to do this too. How? MAKE SMALL TALK INTO BIG TALK, i.e. MEANINGFUL1. Ask an easy lead question.Where are you from? I love this one because there is so much great conversation that can come from it.Others might be;Is this your first . . . (if you meet at an event).Something topical that you\'d both know about given your circumstances (a speech, a person, weather, a meal).Or I sometimes comment on someone\'s name or outfit - whatever I find interesting.2. Ask a follow-up question. You asked; Where are you from? They tell you. Follow up with: What\'s it like this time of year? How long have you lived there? Do you like living there? Has it changed much in the past 20 years?  (Most places have and this is always interesting).The purpose of a follow-up is to let the person know you are interested in them and to prompt them with an easy conversation topic so you can engage. 3. Use physical communication to show interest and emotion.Imagine a robot saying "I find you interesting." Creeepy. Words alone don\'t work.To convey a genuine sense of interest, you have to emote.That\'s interesting. Really? How did that work? And show interest, surprise. Lean forward. Make eye contact. Show them that you are listening and care. (Just don\'t flirt - not appropriate.)4. Offer your opinion and an anecdote.Don\'t be afraid of saying "me too" or "that happened to me!". When I say "opinion" I don\'t mean religion or politics. I mean affirming what they said and relating to it. This forms a bond. Obviously, only if it\'s true.Nothing wrong with it but you might want to say "I\'m so sorry for interrupting." After you interrupt. Just in case.5. Have a "what do you do?" answer ready to go, in simple terms your grandmother could understand.When someone asks you what you do - and they will - don\'t think on the spot, have the answer ready. Say it in simple terms, nothing kills a conversation like someone using industry speak to another person not in the industry. It makes you sound pompous, not impressive.6. Some people are impenetrable. Don\'t fret. Move on.I can talk to anyone. Except . . .there are a few people who are as dull as toast. No, that\'s an insult to toast. Dull as as a toaster that doesn\'t have toast.You won\'t connect with everyone. No one does.Above all, this is CRITICAL and the most important thing you can doBE INTERESTED IN THE PERSON YOU\'RE TALKING TO.Actually care. That is the secret.Small talk is a way to get to know interesting people. Not to show you\'re interesting. People don\'t judge you based on your resume; they judge you based on how they connect to you. Care about them, you\'ll connect to them.'

Just keep saying, "It\'s our rule, it\'s the same for everyone.

S' Oh heavens, yes!Many attributes of writing (notwithstanding \'writing as a career\') are instinctively romantic, aka \'idealized\':It\'s a profession that relies on talents of creativity and even dreaming and pondering.When people write they self-express, it\'s empowering to even the weakest writers.Writing forces you to practice thoughtfulness, mindfulness, relaxation - like exercise, it makes you feel good.There is independence, not having a boss or manager. You do it for yourself.Learning, interacting, being inspired - things that others do for pleasure - are part of the work.The rules are made to be broken. Yes, there is a lot of craft in all types of writing, but breaking free of that *could* make you a better writer.The accolades! The upvotes, likes, fans etc. To be a writer is to be seen, loved.These are all wonderful attributes that probably have lured more than one innocent diary-writer into being more than a diary-writer. Add that to the ease with which one can get "published" (you really just need an internet connection and a few thousand words) and sure, writing is ideal!The reason it\'s overrated is that people erroneously think these wonderful attributes become EXPONENTIAL when you do it as a career. They\'d be wrong. I\'ve met zero full-time writers who romanticize their careers. They love it, but they see it for what it is and do it because it\'s worth the costs. What are the costs? Why is writing as a career not as ideal as it seems?Creating is a small part of it. The rest of it, is administrative. Editing, typing, publicizing, communicating, studying, etc. People don\'t see what you do as a career. More like an overwrought hobby. We hear a lot of "What fun, I wish I could do that!\' Well, you can. You just have to learn to not have much income or success.You are \'free\' because you make your own hours, yes, however \'Free\' to you is "can be taken advantage of" to someone else. Oh Ellen can do it, its not like she works or anything.Progress and accomplishment are mythical. Get used to not having any. People ask me where I\'m published. I\'m not yet.. . But I\'m getting better every week! I see the pity in their eyes.Every. Single. Thing. You. Do. Will. Be. Judged. And usually rejected. If it\'s not being rejected, get a new audience.You create something JUST to destroy it and remake it. And not necessarily for the better. Not super efficient.The hours. The time. The hours. The time. What did you do today? Ummm, I didn\'t write something awful. Also, I did some thinking . . You don\'t do it for yourself. We\'d love to just create something new and unique, but writers have to think about the commercial aspect if we want to survive. We have to self-promote and hustle. And compromise.It\'s lonely. Not just because it\'s often done in solitude, but because you create this thing that no one will see as you do. The way you feel about your work, that is yours and yours alone. My writing comes from a depth that I must travel to alone. I\'ve never felt so alone. Career writers see writing as hard work, but worth it. Occasionally it has rewards, but you don\'t expect them. You don\'t anticipate them. Our rewards are in making a good product.We can\'t romanticize. We\'re too busy getting our experiences into ideas our ideas into sentences our sentences into words and our words on a page. And then perhaps a wine before we tear it all up and try again.

S' You measure yourself as an inverse function of others\' happiness. We all do, I get dry sweats and night terrors every time my alumni magazine comes around. These people outshined me in college, they outshine me in life. Bah.But this isn\'t the right way to look at it. I\'m going to use algebra to illustrate.This is how you see your situation:YOU + Hy < YOUR PEERS + Hp [where Hy is your happiness quotient, Hp is that of your peers.]To switch this equation to =/>, you can change 4 inputs;1. Increase YOU: 2. Increase YOUR HAPPINESS (Hy)3. Decrease YOUR PEERS4. Decrease YOUR PEERS\' HAPPINESS (Hp)I know, confusing. Let\'s take them one by one to see what the hell I\'m talking about;1. Increase YOU What does this mean? It means, change the fundamental things that you value about yourself. Right now you list money, travel, good memories.But what if you changed what you value? What if you put your self-worth and life-worth into things that weren\'t so material or "Facebookable" to things that actually matter in the long-run?How do you treat other people?Are you kind to animals?Are you intelligent and curious?Have you meant something special to another other person?Have you used your talents to advance knowledge?Are you kind and compassionate?This is hard to change, yes. But it is sustainable. You WILL realize someday that Facebook posts don\'t matter. Why wait? 2. Increase YOUR HAPPINESSWhat does this mean? Let\'s say your value system is money, travel, good memories - Double down! Do things to make money - only. Travel even if you have to be dangerous. Only be friends with people who can help you make memories. Re-prioritizing your life isn\'t hard if you focus and commit. If you think this is the key to you being happy, do it! 3. Decrease YOUR PEERSWhat does this mean? Simply, it means, get new friends. Ones that aren\'t as impressive. When you aren\'t confronted with their amazingness, you won\'t feel bad about yourself.Although this would be easy to do cosmetically - defriend - it is disruptive, does it really solve your issues long-term? Impressive people have a way of always being around. I have alumni mags to prove it.4. Decrease YOUR PEERS\' HAPPINESSWhat does this mean? Get it in your head PEOPLE AREN\'T AS HAPPY AS THEY LOOK ON FACEBOOK. Really. They aren\'t. I ALWAYS post the best photos of myself having the BEST time, and doing the MOST amazing things. Isn\'t that what Facebook is for?People\'s lives are much more nuanced than you think, and their problems much larger. See their happiness differently. So those are your options.From my experience a few sound good, but don\'t work. Ditching your happy friends, is that really what you want? Good luck with that, Scrooge.Just BEING more exceptional, yes - sure, that helps. But, haven\'t you tried this? Haven\'t we all? And are you willing to make the sacrifices it takes?And #4, So cliche. Everyone says "Remember, no one is as happy as they appear!!" Easy to remember, difficult to accept in the moment. It\'s like telling someone with mouth cancer \'Just remember to not have mouth cancer. Smile!\' - OR - You can change your values. Stop prioritizing money, travel, memories etc. Measure yourself on who you are as a person.I know, it sounds hard. Impossible. Money, job, travel etc. are the world\'s agreed on barometer\'s of success. Who are you to change that?You are the voice of intelligence and reason. You are a good person. You\'re someone who will win at life. I promise you, in life (and after the age of 35) being a good person is what matters. All that matters.How to start? How do you change your values and start to deliver on them?Start with Facebook. Since you\'re probably on there already. Make a plan to read 10 posts from friends, and to make yourself feel positive about them. When you feel the self-doubt creep, imagine them being happy. Imagine the event, before and after the post. Imagine them laughing, feeling proud. Let it flow through you. Like yourself feel it too.Happiness is when I see others happy. - Desmond TutuPractice regularly. Happiness and selflessness are infectious and will influence more things you do and feel. What matters to you will start to change over time and materialistic things will matter less.Soon, you\'ll think, \'Why did I let this get to me? I\'m a good person. I bet I\'m the only one on Facebook who is truly happy for everyone else. I\'m awesome. I wish I knew how to post my awesomeness on Facebook. . . \'You can\'t, not really.

In fact, I can\'t exactly remember which one of us said it first or how it happened.We don\'t really have a *story.* But I\'ll attempt to tell our non-story here:We were living together in Palo Alto, about to graduate from Stanford Business School and feeling anxious about the fact that we had jobs in different cities. I took a job in Chicago and he in New York.So we discussed what to do: Should we stay together? Yes, we think so. Should we plan to visit each other regularly? Probably, makes sense. Should we just get married? Oooh, we don\'t know. We need to think. Maybe? But how do we know? We didn\'t know.I am 90% sure I was the one who said "Shouldn\'t we just get married?" Does that count as a proposal?Regardless, marriage was now in the air, it was out, it was between us. We thought about it. For a week or two. And in the meantime graduated GSB and planned our summer trip to hike in the National Parks in Southern Utah.And then we went out to a movie with friends. Up (2009) The first sequence, when Carl and Ellie are living out their life, growing older in love. Both of us took each other\'s hand and from that point, we knew. We wanted to be that couple. No - we WERE that couple already. That is really important. We recognized ourselves and our future life and marriage just kinda fell into place.We looked at rings the next day. I wanted one that looked like my mother\'s, yellow gold, single diamond. Classic. But they didn\'t have that. Yellow gold wasn\'t *in.* Which made me want it even more. They had to order it. My husband wanted to get me a bigger diamond, I talked him down a carrot, or half, or a third I can\'t recall. He forgave me.When he got the engagement ring he arranged an official proposal and it was lovely and I think my response was "Great. Go call my parents. Oh, and yes, of course!"It felt like nothing built up or romantic. It felt like us. Totally, completely us. Taking the next obvious step in our lives together.Thanks Disney.'

S' To be honest, the fact that it\'s expensive prevents me from stealing it. I "steal" inexpensive things all the time. Those little wooden stirrers from Starbucks, I use them to prop up plants I grow from seed. Is 5 stealing? What about 30?I once stole a nice computer bag out of a donate pile and used it for a year. That\'s stealing from Salvation Army, they could have sold it.I stole a bunch of perfume samples from someone\'s house - they were shiny and smelly and I loved them and used them.When I was really young, I used to go with Mom to the garden store and pick up all the fake flowers that had fallen into the aisle. The had come apart and were going to be swept up, but still - that\'s stealing.It\'s not good enough to say "Stealing is wrong" or "My conscious prevents me." It is a much more nuanced and complicated. When something is expensive, it has a much higher likelihood of belonging to someone. Someone owns it , values it, and it\'s not mine. And I don\'t think it\'s right to make it mine outside of the proper system.When something is extremely inexpensive (or tossed aside), it likely does NOT have ownership. (And in its aggregate it can\'t be expensive either). Thus, it feels more like picking up something that is useless to others and giving it a home.When I picked up the flowers that had dropped on the floor, I remember feeling love for them. Like I was going to take care of them and protect them, enjoy them. And I did. Until Mom found out and threw them away. I\'m not saying this is moral or rational or even socially acceptable. But it is honestly how I think about it.'

S' You don\'t like this non-credit world? Really?Oh, that must be because you are a current user. You\'re not thinking about it right. You\'re not thinking about it like Quora does. They are not interested in you. I mean they are, they want to keep you and keep your account active - if you have a good bio, ask good questions and write good answers. If you don\'t - it\'s fine if you lurk.But what they are REALLY interested in is the marginal non-Quora user who types into Google "What camera took the photo of Pluto and how does it work?" and the top return is a link to Quora. Because Quora has the best answers on the internet. This is where their growth is. To get to the BEST answer returned in a Google search, they have to get the BEST answer according to their algorithm.Your promotions were getting in the way. You promote bad content. You distort the system. I don\'t, because I\'m a Top Writer, and I have proven good taste - except, I don\'t. Crap. No, my promotions weren\'t good either, and I actually made more of a mess because I have so many credits and promoted so often.So now they\'re removing the untrustworthy human component which might not lead to the best answer on the internet, and replacing it with well, nothing. More reliance on specific titles, bios, answer length, citations and upvotes by people who also have a history of specific titles, bios, answer length etc.So the UPSIDE is that it\'s highly likely if you\'re not a Quora user and you type a question into Google, you will get the best answer on the internet and that answer will be on Quora. This is good for Quora is it\'s likely that those Tip Top answerers - Blue Check people - whose answer counts for more than yours because it\'s more likely to be the best answer on the internet - will be more likely to find and contribute to Quora. Quora needs these people. Thousands of of Blue Check folks are not on Quora. Yet.Both of these things are excellent for Quora in realizing its stated goal and for improving all-around content. (If you trust their algorithm).The DOWNSIDE is to current users, the community. - Loss of a primary user-driver; gaming - (Read Robert\'s answer) but they will solve that. It\'s easy enough to do outside of the algorithm and they certainly have the data to reward people for milestones.- Onslaught of A2As - they will figure this out too, how to prioritize them. For one, it will affect the Quora employees, I can\'t imagine Marc Bodnick putting up with endless A2As, can you?- No, the biggest loss is to the community. It\'s a tear in the social fabric. A fabric that\'s stitched when I upvote you and you promote me and then we mutually exchange a PM or remember each other\'s avatars and follow each other. And multiply this by 100k a day so that we all feel connected here to something bigger. This bigger thing connects us to Quora far more than wanting to know the best answers on the internet. The bigger thing this interconnectedness, this fabric - it is what makes us care.It\'s the fabric keeps us here, keeps us engaged, keeps us investing in others, keeps us writing. Maybe not providing "the best answer on the internet" but thoughtful, provocative, insightful things.To me, the human element - caring - is everything. Quora taking steps to remove that element, bit-by-bit, will absolutely make me less interested in returning to the site. But - and I don\'t say this in self-pity, not remotely, perhaps that is what they want? Or at least, they don\'t mind that consequence. I can accept that. Quora\'s a business. It will do what it has to do as a business. If not keeping me happy is part of that, so be it. Ultimately, is this credit change good or bad? Depends on how you use Quora. It might be good, bad or irrelevant. I have no insight into Quora\'s changes or motivations. The answer is speculation, not fact.'

S" What you're saying is that you expect others to care and love you the way you care and love them. There is nothing wrong with that, we all do that. We show love in different ways and then when we receive it, if it's not in the way we give it, we fail to recognize it. And even think it's not there. I prefer to be completely alone when I'm going through something hard. Not bothered, not forced to talk about it - just left to sort it out on my own. So, naturally, I give other people space when they are going through something hard. To me, it is me being considerate and loving but you can imagine how well that goes down with my friends. Not great.If they are really close to them, ask them how they'd want to be supported. What kind of things they'd need. Maybe talk about it not in the situation but when things are calm and normal.Get insight from this. Figure out how they want to be supported and that will give you clues as to how they are probably doing it for you. Maybe in ways you don't see. Try to recognize it.Consider your own habits and approaches. Are you really helping them the way they need it? Are you doing what they'd want? Or are you doing what you'd want?And finally, if you have friends taking advantage of you and your generous nature, then reduce your expectations of them. It will be hard and sad, but you have to tell yourself that this person isn't what you thought, and just won't be there for you. And find others who will do better."

S' You\'re both right. A profession is a signal to the outside world about your personality, intelligence and skills. Certain professions, like doctor, carry a more positive signal than others (but depends on specifics).(1) People will open doors for you because of a profession. Sure. They might trust your opinions, your judgement. They will see your title or job and think "This person will be smart, giving, kind, mature . . . " any number of things.Signal: I\'m a doctorInterpretation: He\'s a doctor, he must be smart, hard-working, and care about helping others.Why do they think that, just because you\'re a doctor? No. Because of what it takes TO BECOME a doctor. It\'s rigorous! Only the brightest and best do it!But you have to live up to the interpretation that your profession is making. I.E. they will also hold you to a standard based on what THEY think you should know and be like and if you fail to meet their criteria, you will fall from their grace just as much as you would anyone\'s.Signal: I\'m a doctorInterpretation: He\'s a doctor, he must be smart, hard-working, and care about helping others.Test: Doctor is at restaurant, someone is choking, Doctor doesn\'t know how to administer the Heimlich Maneuver or just decides he doesn\'t want to, everyone in restaurant and soon entire town hate said Doctor.In this case, the Doctor FAILED to meet expectations, and now no one gives two shits he\'s a doctor.Your brother can become a Doctor, but that alone won\'t get him lasting respect. He has to actually BE the kind of things that being a "Doctor" signal to the rest of the world. That is why becoming a doctor is such hard work.(1) Example of a profession having different signals different places, in U.S., an "lawyer" is someone who has gone to an accredited Law School and passed the BAR to practice law. It is rigorous, full of exams and tests and not everyone makes it. In Mexico, "licenciado" is a term that can be used to mean lawyer. It can ALSO mean anyone who has a degree. When I see someone from a Spanish-speaking country with "LIC" on their business card, I don\'t think it means attorney nor that they necessarily passed rigorous schooling and exam to become one.'

S' This question really affected me and I feel for you because I have been there, many times. Since moving to England, where they use the word mental to mean a lot of things, I say it. That was mental. Or you\'re being mental (to my husband). I could imagine a situation where it pops out at someone who feels it more deeply and personally. And here is the thing, I have a mental illness! But I throw it around. I do to reduce the power of it, make it mean something less. But as you said, it\'s less about that word and more about "letting it show."I live with this fear every day. I have anxiety about it every hour of every single day. I\'m afraid that someone will see, think I\'m not normal, treat me with gloves, be afraid of me, think less of me, reject me, hate me. Call me mental. Crazy. Not normal.I feel most of the time like I have this awful monster inside of me. (The term is derogatory, I\'ve played with making it less so - like "Polar Bear." I\'m just not there yet.) A monster of sadness, anger, hatred, fear, panic, mental illness, all bad things. I have to keep him fed, tame, and hidden. It takes tremendous energy. And it is so lonely sometimes I can\'t think straight.But when I do that, keep him down, people love me. Except, that doesn\'t last. Because I tell myself it\'s only because they don\'t know. If they really saw this monster - they\'d fear me. Judge me. Diminish me. Leave me.Most people are ok hearing you have a mental illness. They even ask about it. How are you doing? How is that mental illness? No one is ok seeing it. No one wants to see the monster. Once they see it, that\'s all they see. You can\'t put it back, you can\'t get them to see the normal you. It\'ll never be the same. Even the ones who say, no, I know, it\'s ok. I\'ll love you. You know they won\'t.So, what do you do? You ask about getting thicker skin. Which is, in a sense, building a stronger cage for the monster. That might work, and should work around random people - you have no need for them to affect you. You are paranoid that this person actually thinks you are crazy - he or she has no idea. I PROMISE you, he or she doesn\'t think you are any more crazy than anyone else. You are hiding it more than you think. Trust me on that, if I\'ve learned one thing, it\'s that we\'re better at "not letting it show" than we think.Another solution is to let this monster out of the cage, for walks, occasionally, with people you trust. Do you have people around whom you can have your mental illness? You have to. You have to let someone in and let someone help you with this. The reason that your question affected me is that I immediately realized, I don\'t have anyone. No, I have one person, my husband. He\'s the only person I show. He\'s the only person in my life who I can SHOW my monster to. Not even my cats! Ha. That makes it worst, I realize now, not showing people - hiding it, makes it worse.The first step is telling someone, people, you trust, about this. Letting them in. Tell them what you feel. What happens. What you go through. I think the second step, is helping other people with THEIR monsters. I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve let people cry to me. Tell me things. Show me the darkest parts of themselves. Everyone opens up to me. It took me a while to realize, THESE are their monsters! Just, more tame than mine. But it really isn\'t that different. All humans have depths and darkness.Next step, show them yours. I\'m not there yet. Maybe we can work on this together? In the meantime, I\'ll start calling it my Polar Bear, maybe that will remove some stigma. No more monster.'

I don\'t follow the blogs about crafts written by men.It might be that there are just not females writing about the things you care about. I love movies.

The power of these words has diminished and that affects the people who really need to use them. Sexist would be if you don\'t follow, read or like someone JUST BECAUSE a female authored it. Regardless of topic, writing, viewpoint, content - if it were written by a male, you\'d like it. But not by a female.I don\'t know whether you are sexist. But let\'s put that aside and not try to solve it now, ok? The simple thing to do is to read more female writers. Start here:What women do you recommend following on Quora?It\'s ok to do this, you\'re not giving them special treatment because they are female, you\'re holding them to the same standard, you\'re just forcing yourself to read - not like - their work.It\'s ok to not like something a female writes. It\'s ok to not agree with something a female writes. It\'s ok to like something specific written by a male rather than a female.It\'s ok to have interests and hobbies that are dominated by male POVs (although, like me with movies, you might want to check on this).It is NOT ok to not read females or not like their writing JUST BECAUSE they are female.

S' There are MANY stories that feature central characters who are unloved and/or unloving (societal, romantic, familial love). Here are a few, most have been made into films but the books are better.Child of God - Cormac McCarthyThe Color Purple - Alice WalkerFrankenstein -  Mary ShelleyThe Old Curiosity Shop - Charles DickensAmerican Psycho - Bret Easton EllisCatcher in the Rye - J.D. SalingerStoner - John WilliamsAnd as far as movies go - look no further than Citizen Kane (1941). Or M (1931) , Taxi Driver (1976), or Sunset Blvd. (1950). I\'d write this story same way I\'d start any story: with an outline. K.M. Weiland has written a fantastic book Outlining Your Novel: Map Your Way to Success, I recommend. I borrow conceptually from it here, but not directly; 1. Theme/premise - What is this about, what are you trying to say? With the concept of "main character is unloved" there are a few ways this could go.Examples include:Someone who is unloved is bound to take it out on societySomeone who is unloved is bound to take it out on parentsUnloved person was really loved all the time, just couldn\'t see itUnloved person is unable to also give love and will reject love in all its formsUnloved person is actually better at giving love than most people.Unloved person will spend entire life trying to find love.Unloved person can find self-love and live happily.Find a theme that hasn\'t been explored to death by literature and find one about which you can say something unique. It helps if you are innately attracted to one of them.OR you could write a story that isn\'t about love, primarily, it just features a character that is unloved as a background motivation (like Citizen Kane):Person wants to aggregate all the wealth in the worldPerson wants to redeem himself by being overly generous, saviorPerson mistrusts everyone and is concerned with others\' downfall2. Story /Plot - What actually happens to develop this theme? Depending on which specific theme you choose, your story arc or plot could go a variety of ways. The most simple way to structure is;(1) Beginning, (2) Middle + Climax, (3) Resolution.I tend to make it chronological first to get the plot right, then I play around with what happened when. I call it Memento-ing the story. I might start with the outcome, not the tragedy, then a flash-back to show how it got there.Examples of a plot include:(1) Unloved person is unloved and (2) then finds love, destroys it (3) lives alone.(1) Unloved person is unloved (2) then doesn\'t find love and (3) takes revenge(1) Unloved person is unloved (2) expects love, is disappointed (3) loves anyway.3. Ironing out the details. This is actually the bulk of your work, (I\'m giving a HIGH level overview, but you should put a lot of pre-writing energy and time into these aspects).Characters - what are character motivations? Start with main character, depending on your theme, it might be to find love, to give love, to reject love, or love might not be the main theme. Do you need a secondary character? Who are they, what are their motivations? Write character backstory, remember; what you are really looking for as you explore your characters\' history are the epochs, the catalysts, the notable events that have marked your characters\' lives for better or worse in a way they\'ll never forget.- Outlining your Novel, K.M. WeilandWhat about supporting characters - who are they? What are their motivations? What roles to do they play? What happens to them? What are their backstories?Setting - Where does this take place? Is it a small domestic drama? (Like Jane Austen) or is it a sweeping epic (Like Citizen Kane)? When does it take place, current, past, future? Over 70 years or over 2 weeks, 2 hrs?Plot - You have the main plot, but you need details. You can use What if questions and let your creative percolate and then regulate with structure. Or start with structure and use it to get creative.A few specific plot structures:http://www.writerstoauthors.com/...http://english.learnhub.com/less...Depending on whether you are a bottoms up or top down writer, either way might work (I\'m a bottom\'s up - I generate creative flurry first, then fit it into a structure).Narrative voice -  Will this be in first person? From whose point of view? What are limits or bonuses of having either/or?Keep flushing these things out until you have pages of character information and backstory, a plot line on a wall with key turning points and changes, and lots of research that you probably won\'t ever use.And then, my friend, WRITE. Like the wind (but with organization and purpose).There are many ways to outline and structure both WRITING and the WRITING PROCESS. A quick internet search will pop up many options. This is just what works for me.'

S' There are a few reasons this could be offensive. Or at least make someone bristle at it and perhaps, question your intentions.First, your use of the word "Mexican." Mexican isn\'t a race, it is a nationality and ethnicity. It wouldn\'t be appropriate to say someone "looks Mexican" unless you are in place that is predominantly Mexican people (Like El Paso). Latino, Latin, Hispanic are more appropriate terms to describe a generic individual from Latin America (because many immigrants of descendants of immigrants in the U.S. are from countries other than Mexico). Referring all Latin descendants as "Mexicans" is ignorant. Like referring to all Asian immigrants as Chinese.Second, without more context, what you say could be derogatory. It\'s not derogatory to call someone Mexican, just like it isn\'t to call someone Jewish.But to describe looks? What do you mean by that? How does someone listening know that you mean nothing by it? Especially if they are a Latino who HAS heard derogatory statements made about them based on their skin color, height, hair - all sorts of things. Political correctness, though clunky and annoying - is supposed to make our speech more neutral so we can avoid such misinterpretations when our intentions aren\'t clear. I\'m not saying this is perfect, but it might have been better if your statement was more neutral "I could see someone mistaking you for a Latino" Rather than "You look Mexican." Does that feel right?I am not politically correct, not by a long- shot. To make up for that, I make my intentions clear, and leave room for doubt and discussion. Example: I visited a good friend of mine Vishwanath Ram in Texas. Vishy is Indian, he has tan skin, thick dark hair and he lives in a community where there are a lot of Mexican immigrants and citizens.I asked him if he was ever mistaken as Chicano (what local Mexican\'s call themselves) by locals and I didn\'t mean to offend him, I was just curious. This might be offensive to someone, but it wasn\'t to Vishy. (And if it was I hope he says in the comments).You asking this here, without prejudice, shows just the kind of openness I\'m talking about. Very cool.I also follow the rule that the people who raise the most stink about what is offensive to someone else (on things that really aren\'t that offensive) but can\'t tell you why it\'s offensive do so to hide the fact that they have no idea what they are talking about and have never actually interacted with someone of the supposed offended party in their life. These people suck. Ignore them.'

S' White light (a.k.a. continuum) generation is a nonlinear optical process which can happen when ultrafast pulses of laser light propagate through certain media (examples of such media can be seen/purchased here).The first ingredient of white light generation is the Kerr effect, which causes the index of refraction to be different depending on the intensity of light ([math]n=n_0+n_K I[/math]). A focused pulsed laser has intensity which is variable in space (as any beam would if it is focused to a small spot) and also in time. The second ingredient of white light generation is self-phase modulation, which is a consequence of an intensity-dependent index of refraction coupled with a beam intensity with a strong time-dependence. The rising edge of the pulse will see an increasing index of refraction leading to an increase phase lag, and the trailing edge of the pulse will see the opposite. This instantaneous phase shift will result in an instantaneous frequency shift such that a spectrum broader in frequency than the original is produced.source: Self-phase modulation'

S" I am aware of the term 'optical pumping' being used in two contexts.Producing a laser (this is by far the most common usage)A prerequisite for lasing is population inversion, in which there are more electrons in an excited energy level than in the ground state. Shining light on the system (a.k.a. optical pumping) is a common way of producing population inversion.Producing a non-equilibrium configuration of electrons/atoms/molecules in a sample using a laserIn some experiments, one wants to create a situation which is not thermodynamically stable and watch how it comes back to equilibrium. One way to achieve the former is to shine laser light (often short laser pulses) on a material. This is sometimes called optical pumping (if it uses optical frequencies), especially in the context of a pump-probe experiment."

Many professors mispronounce words or make grammar mistakes when they speak, and frankly, from the standpoint of a native speaker, it is not jarring and it does not make them sound less intelligent.My inclination to not correct English grammar mistakes comes from listening to other people (usually not native speakers) correct others' grammar in their presentations. I feel this is not a good use of people's time, and feedback on their content would almost certainly be more helpful. I understand that there are other languages which are much more rigid than English, in which people tend to judge others' intelligence based on their spoken execution of the language. However, English is a more flexible language and it also has a lot more non-native speakers than most other languages. Thus, in my opinion, people come off pedantic when they frequently correct spoken English grammar without solicitation in the context of academia where the speaker is known to be highly educated."

S' The human voice box (see: Larynx) is a resonant cavity of sorts, which amplifies sounds seeded by vibration of the vocal chords. An analogy of this is a guitar, where plucking the strings produces the initial sound, but this sound is amplified by bouncing around in the body. Helium has a higher speed of sound than air so it tends to amplify higher frequency sounds.The simplest way to think of the voice box (or any resonant cavity) is that sounds will be amplified if you can fit an integer number of wavelengths in the cavity. Lets call the dimension of the cavity L (units=meters). For the case of the voice box, this is presumably varied by the phonal muscles, but keep in mind that our brain has internalized that a certain configuration is required to produce a given pitch. The speed of sound is denoted by [math]v_s[/math] (units = meters/second). Frequency is given by [math]v_s/L[/math] (units = 1/s), so a higher sound velocity will favor higher frequencies for a given cavity size. The speed of sound is 349 m/s in nitrogen (our atmosphere is mostly nitrogen), 326 m/s in oxygen (good quantity of oxygen in there too), and 1007 m/s in helium (see: Speed of Sound in Various Gases). When our vocal chords vibrate during speech, they produce multiple frequencies, and our voice box instinctively conforms to the correct dimension to produce the pitch we are seeking. When the cavity is filled with helium instead of nitrogen and oxygen, the vocal chords and voice box operate as usual, but the higher frequency sounds are amplified more because the speed of sound is nearly 3 times bigger in helium.'

S' I experienced the trauma of Liboff\'s quantum mechanics book in my undergraduate introductory class, coupled with a professor who thought this would be a good idea. My main problem with the book is that it is terrible as an introductory textbook because it is written in such a way to show off to an expert audience how well another expert has synthesized quantum mechanics and distilled it into \'simpler\' language (and also "remixed" it into an uncoventional exposition order). This attempt to appeal to an expert audience is perhaps why some professors are drawn to Liboff, but undergraduates are decidedly NOT experts, and they need more thoughtful pedagogy.Below are some specific complaints, based on the 4th edition of the book. If there is any justice in the world it is that there has not been a 5th edition.The book is ~2-3x longer than it needs to be and could have benefited from some serious editing. There are only a handful of exactly solvable problems in quantum mechanics, so 840 pages is completely inappropriate for a first go-round. The book is fluffed up with numerous \'real world\' examples which are too specialized for a general undergraduate physics audience.The first actual physics exposition comes in chapter 7, starting p 187. The first 1/4 of the book is filled with history and mathematical formalism, which is unacceptable for a physics textbook. Some people have this erroenous idea that one needs to learn all the mathematics they need before they tackle physics concepts. If someone has chosen to be a physics major, they will almost certainly be more engaged if you introduce mathematical concepts as necessary to explain physics concepts. This book could have started with just one introductory math chapter, like many other quantum mechanics books.Concepts are presented in a weird order which doesn\'t properly reflect a natural pedagogical progression. Harmonic oscillator before rectangular barrier problems with each of them occupying a fraction of a chapter? Higher dimensional versions of these canonical problems presented a few chapters later? WKB approximation towards the beginning of the book and perturbation theory at the very end?Liboff is bad as an introductory textbook, but it also isn\'t great as a reference book to have on your bookshelf. Even as a paperweight it is failing because the cover is fraying prematurely.'

S" It depends. The more you know about your superconductor, the more hard limits can be placed.If you are thinking of a specific material which becomes superconducting by a certain mechanism, then the theoretical limit can be quite modest. For example, if one considers specific materials whose superconductivity is described by Bardeed-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, one can theoretically tune the parameters which are favorable to superconductivity--high density of electron states at the Fermi level and high electron-phonon coupling--within physical limits to ascertain what is the theoretical limit for this material. This sort of analysis was done by McMillan in 1968, and the maximum possible Tc was found to be 40K for specific superconductors that were known back then [1]. This paper has often become victim to a convoluted game of telephone where people got the idea that BCS superconductors could not have a Tc above 40K, which isn't the case.If you are thinking of a specific mechanism of superconductivity (lets stick with BCS since that is the only mechanism supported by a plurality of experiments on materials it claims to describe), you can place limits on Tc based on the elements which exist on the periodic table. One factor which is favorable for BCS superconductivity is atoms which can vibrate very fast, which tends to be lighter elements. The lightest atom is hydrogen, but the problem is that it does not have high density of electron states at the Fermi level because it is not a metal. This can be mitigated by pressurizing the crap out of it. Metallic H under high pressure is expected to become superconducting at approximately room temperature (300-350K) [2][3], so this is the theoretical upper limit for BCS theory. Metallic atomic hydrogen has never been achieved in the lab, but recently, researchers have been able to subject a compound containing a lot of hydrogen--H2S--to very high pressure in order to achieve the highest experimental Tc ever--203K [4]If you are thinking of a specific material or class of materials for which the mechanism of superconductivity is unknown, assessing a highest possible Tc can be quite tricky. An example of such a class of materials is the cuprate high temperature superconductors for which the highest Tc was measured to be 164K under high pressure (133K under ambient pressure) [5]. In this case, the approach one could take to put a theoretical limit on Tc is to pick a mechanism among those that have been suggested and consider the factors that have been empirically shown to raise Tc in cuprates. Some of these factors are charge carrier concentration (doping), the apical oxygen height, the magnetic exchange energy J, and disorder. If any of these factors play into a given proposed theory, one can answer how much a given variable can raise Tc within a given proposed theory which might or might not be the correct one.If someone is completely agnostic about the material and the mechanism of superconductivity--perhaps thinking about materials which have not been discovered yet--it is very difficult to put an upper limit on Tc. If we have learned anything about superconductivity in the 58 years after BCS theory explained the mechanism for one class off superconductors, we have learned that superconductivity is a very common ground state for materials to assume. Many materials have been discovered which would not have been predicted to be superconductors by BCS theory, so there are likely multiple pathways for achieving superconductivity, just like there are multiple ways to make a magnet. With material and mechanism space wide open, a much higher Tc is possible. If we were to set an absolute upper limit, a good inspiration is neutron stars, which are widely believed to exhibit superfluidity (of neutrons) and superconductivity (of protons) with transition temperatures of one billion Kelvin [6].[1] W.

S" A LinkedIn profile for someone in an academic career is different in that it is almost never the primary way in which they showcase their skills, accomplishments, and qualification.For academics who are not looking to transition into a different career, a LinkedIn profile does not serve the same utilities as it does for people in other professions.A means for someone to contact them in a professional capacity: contact information for academics is usually available on their institution's websiteVisibility to recruiters: the 'recruiters' for academic positions are professional academics themselves, and they either contact people by the means above or because they personally know them alreadyJob postings: very few academic jobs are posted on LinkedIn. Because LinkedIn is not particularly useful for academic careers, the LinkedIn profiles of academics tend to be less thoughtfully curated, and they are often just a copy/paste of their CV (which can stretch on for well over 10 pages for senior people). In academic CVs, words like 'investigated', 'studied', and 'searched' count as action verbs, and the really brave among us will manually enter all their publications into an interface which was not meant to handle tens or hundreds of papers with multiple authors. What LinkedIn is useful for is cultivating or maintaining ties with people in industry. This can be useful if one wants to leave academia, if one's student wants to leave academia, or if one wants to start a company based on their research. However, these purposes are explicitly not for an academic career. See also: How important is LinkedIn for PhD students?"

S" When I was an undergraduate in physics many of the exams were HARD (but usually open book, open notes), such that the average grade was well below 75%. No doubt there were some exams which were doable by a majority of the class, but these do not stick out in my mind. This approach has both good and bad points.Good:Real physics problems are challenging, and finding a solution within three hours of seeing the problem is an unnatural occurrenceBecause of the blessings bestowed upon us by the god of partial credit, we were encouraged to try very challenging problems which is helpful for future coursesIt is difficult for professors to come up with exams of the appropriate length and difficulty to be doable in 3 hours but sufficiently challenging to differentiate people who mastered the material better than others, and also not repeat textbook problems or problems from previous year's exams. It is understandable if professors prefer to spend time on other things (teaching is not their main duty in a research university), and as long as they rescale the scores as to not penalize students for this circumstance, no one is hurt.In many of my classes, there were people who were off-the-charts geniuses, but no people who were off-the-charts dunces. A very difficult exam can capture this side of the bell curve better.Bad:Some students will be discouraged, even if the grades are rescaled.The students who are not discouraged may internalize the notion that all difficult exams are meant to be unsolvable, which is a problem if a later course presents difficult looking problems which are meant to be solved completely.Not all difficult exams are created equally. If the 'difficult' problems are really just standard derivations in a later course, this unfairly advantages people who happened to read the more advanced textbook and/or bring it to an open book exam.Thus, arguments can be made favoring both 'impossible' exams and 'challenging but doable' exams. For service courses which are intended for people of all majors, it should probably lean towards the latter. For advanced courses for people in the major, it is probably better to leave this to the discretion of the professor."

The only exception is if you are very injury prone or if you simply don't like running that much.Cross training can mean different things. It can mean alternate aerobic activities such as biking or swimming. These will not help your running (because the impacts and biomechanics are so different) other than maintaining aerobic fitness in the case of injury. Another type of cross training is strength training, and this can indeed improve your running if the type and intensity of activities is chosen appropriately."

S' As someone who works in condensed matter physics, but not specifically on graphene, I am a bit cynical about what is fascinating about graphene because I have heard every spiel 50 times before. A Dirac-like band dispersion? Okay, other materials do this too and have more fun with it. Potential applications in touch screens? Right, everything is transparent if it is one atom thick. An optoelectronic super-material? Call me when you scale the peak of the Gertner hype curve.The one finding that really intrigued me is related to local strains in graphene: gigantic pseudomagnetic fields. When graphene is laid out on a substrate, it naturally exhibits bubbles, wrinkles, dimples, and other local distortions. A certain type of distortion--a triangular bubble--causes electron levels to be quantized in the same way that they would be if they were exposed to a magnetic field of hundreds of Tesla!* For comparison, the magnetic field in a MRI magnet is ~1 Tesla, the biggest DC field that can be produced in a lab is ~25 Tesla, and the biggest useful real magnetic field that can be produced in a lab is ~100 Tesla and this exists only for ~1 millisecond. source: Science MagazineReferences:Strain-Induced PseudoMagnetic Fields Greater Than 300 Tesla in Graphene NanobubblesPseudo magnetic field in strained graphene: Revisited*this is NOT a statement that graphene produces the highest magnetic field ever made.

S' The main "disadvantage" of graphene is that it is not the mythical wonder material that some people believe it is. Reading the questions on Quora, one might conclude that graphene (which is a one-atom-thick sheet of carbon) can be fashioned into bullet-proof vests, skyscrapers, and every last component in your smart phone. This, and especially the applications harnessing a severe misunderstanding of graphene\'s mechanical properties, is far from true. Graphene is a wonderful material for studying basic physics (though certainly not the only interesting material out there) and it might one day be used in select technologies (e.g. transparent conductors for touch screens), but it will not revolutionize every sector it touches by any stretch.'

S" Answering the question itself (not the details): yes, it is possible to change the color of a material gradually and permanently by applying a voltage, and the mechanism I am thinking of is ion conduction.There are materials called 'solid electrolytes' (see Fast ion conductor) which conduct ions, but not electricity, when a voltage is applied. Ions move by hopping from void to void in the crystal structure, and an applied voltage (and possibly an increased temperature) give a portion of the ions sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier for this process. One specific example of a solid electrolyte is Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)(Y2O3+ZrO2), the artist also known as cubic zirconia, where oxygen ions (or the vacancy thereof) can be conducted from one side of the crystal to another by applying a voltage (see images below). Normally, YSZ is transparent, but a different concentration of oxygen and/or oxygen vacancies can change the color by:changing the lattice parameters such that the band gap changesIntroducing 'color centers'--states inside the band gap which absorb light and give the material an increasingly brownish appearance as their concentration increasesReference: V. R. PaiVerneker, et al, Phys. Rev.

S' Helium is a relatively scarce and non-renewable resource on earth. In addition, it has many uses in industry and in research, some of which cannot substitute something else for helium, so there is a large (inelastic) demand for this scarce resource. These three factors conspire to make it expensive (~$15/Liter (125 grams) for liquid helium in the US).Scarce:Terrestrial helium is almost solely a biproduct of uranium and thorium fission. These elements are not very abundant on earth (see: Abundance of the chemical elements) Helium is extracted from the earth through natural gas mining, where it typically constitutes only a small percentage (<5%) of the gas in the mine. There are costs associated with distilling this small constituent from the rest of the gas, and the effort is only worthwhile if prices are high enough.Non-renewable:The earth is not producing new uranium and thorium, so that which exists on earth is pretty much the only source of heliumOnce helium is released into the atmosphere, it becomes uneconomical to recover it because it is so diffuse--only 0.000524% (see: Atmosphere of Earth)Demand:As the smallest non-reactive atom, helium is the only element that can be used to detect small cracks in vessels that need to be able to withstand extreme pressures (both low and high)As the cryogen with the lowest boiling temperature, helium is extensively used in research applications, such as the Large Hadron Collider as well as low temperature physics labs at your local university. While there are theoretically other ways to cool something to very low temperatures, these alternate methods are not an appropriate substitute for every situation because of space, vibration, durability, magnetic field, and other concerns.Hospital MRI machines and the semiconductor industry also make extensive use of helium.The only factor that diminishes the cost of helium is that it is non-reactive so it can be recycled indefinitely.'

S" For helium-4, the more abundant isotope, bringing extraterrestrial sources back to earth is a worthless proposition because of the quantities that are required. For helium-3, it may be economically feasible to mine it on the moon, but we haven't come close to completely exploiting all the ways of manufacturing it on earth.My answer to Are we really running out of helium?, received many ridiculous comments about how we don't have to conserve helium on earth because we can just get it from the moon (or better yet, Jupiter. Seriously, people? fucking jupiter??), so I thought I would address this here.BackgroundAll of the helium-4 on earth is produced via radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, and hence there is a finite amount which can ever exist. Moreover, once it is released into the atmosphere, it becomes so diffuse that it is stupid expensive to recover it. Finally, the helium which does exist in the atmosphere is slowly being released into space because of its low atomic mass. Thus, helium is a non-renewable resource on earth and one which is non-substitutable for some applications, particularly for leak-checking certain types of pressure or vacuum vessels and for cooling things down close to absolute zero temperature for scientific study. Helium makes up almost a quarter of the mass in our universe, and it is found in abundance in our sun and in gaseous planets in our solar system. Additionally, there is some quantity on the moon. However, this does NOT mean that it is practical with today's, tomorrow's, and next century's technology to extract helium from these extraterrestrial sources and bring it back to earth. In the rest of the answer, I will primarily make reference to lunar mining for the obvious reason that it is over 1000 times closer to the earth than Jupiter is.see also: Inna Vishik's answer to Are we really running out of helium?Helium-4These days, liquid helium-4 cost ~$1000 for 100L, and this amount of helium might keep a physics experiment at 4.2K for one week. This 100L of liquid helium weighs only ~12.5kg. An equal volume of water would weigh almost 10 times as much. According to wikipedia, previous space shuttle launches had payloads of ~15,000kg (and this didn't go as far as the moon, but whatever). This is only $1.2 million of helium at today's prices, and launching a shuttle to reach the moon (which is a lot cheaper than say, jupiter) is at least two orders of magnitude more expensive, not to mention the cost of actually finding and mining helium on the moon. Helium-4 is a very poor candidate for extraterrestrial mining because you really need a lot of it (unlike, say, platinum) to do anything useful. Long before prices rise enough to make extraterestrial mining a topic of conversation, you will see the end of recreational helium balloons, all research/industrial users will be required to recycle, and mining operations will become more keen on extracting/selling smaller amounts of helium instead of just releasing it to atmosphere.Helium-3Helium-3 is a rarer isotope of helium, and most of it is manufactured as a byproduct of nuclear energy/weapons, rather than mined like helium-4 (though it can also be mined). In low-temperature physics, He-3 is required in order to reach the lowest temperatures currently possible for bulk solids--down to milliKelvin temperatures. It also has potential as a fuel for nuclear fusion. He-3 costs over $2000 per liter (note that I quoted the price for He-4 per 100L) , but much smaller quantities are needed than of He-4, excluding the possibility that fusion applications become more ubiquitous one day. In recent years, only ~8kg per year were used in the US. He-3 is more common in the moon's crust than it is on earth (see: lunarnetworks.blogspot.in). This coupled with the fact that it is 100x more expensive and used in orders of magnitude less quantity than helium-4, might make lunar mining a less ridiculous proposition. However, the earth's resources of He-3 have not been utilized to their full capacity, so I foresee an effort in that area before lunar mining is considered.see: Page on fas.org"

S" The time lag is ~5-20 femtoseconds, depending on the energy of the photons and materials parameters of the metal. One femtosecond is [math]10^{-15}[/math] seconds or one quadrillionth of a second. This is super fast, but there are emerging experiments which can perform measurements on this time scale and faster (see: Attophysics). Below are details about where this time lag comes from.The photoemission process can be divided into three steps, each of which can be assigned a timescale.Electron receives energy kick from photonExcited electron travels to the surface of the materialElectron exits the material, losing energy equal to the material's work functionHow long does each of these steps take?Step 1: Like the well known momentum-position Heisenberg uncertainty relation, there is a similar one for energy and time. Thus, when one knows the energy of a process, they can assign a timescale to it which is inversely proportional, based on this uncertainty. The relevant energy in the first step is the energy of the photon, which can vary by many orders of magnitude. For the sake of argument, lets pick something on the low end, say 10 electron volts (eV). This corresponds to a timescale ([math]t=h/E[/math], using planck's constant, h, in appropriate units) of 0.4 femtoseconds (fs). Step 3: I am going out of order here because this step is similar to 1. Here, the relevant energy is the work function of the metal, which varies a bit among materials, but 4.5 eV is a good guess. This corresponds to a time uncertainty of 0.9 fs.Step 2: This step is given by [math]\\frac{\\text{how far the electron travels}}{\\text{how fast it is going}}[/math]. Lets only consider primary electrons, which make it outside the sample without scattering with other electrons first. Thus, 'how far the electron travels' is given by the electron's mean free path in the material. This is not a strong function of which material you consider, but it is a strong function of the electron's kinetic energy after it received a kick from the photon (see image below). Using the 10eV kinetic energy, we get a distance around 1 nm. For a measure of how fast the electron is going, we can use the fermi velocity, which varies a lot among different materials. A typical value (give or take a factor of 10) is [math]10^5[/math] m/s. Thus, we get [math]10^{-14}[/math]s, or 10 fs, as the time it takes the electron to travel to the surface.Thus, we get 11.3 fs altogether for the time lag between arrival of photon and emission of photoelectron, for the particular experiment and materials parameters considered here.Inelastic mean free path of electrons in a solid (many different materials are compiled in this graph) in nanometers, as a function of the electrons' kinetic energy.

Photoemission of secondary electrons happens via a multi-step process, not by having two electrons absorb part of the photon's energy simultaneously.Photoemission due to the photoelectric effect is described via the 'three step model.'An electron in an occupied band absorbs a photon and gets excited into an unoccupied state. At this point, the work function of the material has not entered into the picture yet.source: Page on springer.comThe electron travels to the surface of the material. It is during this process that it can scatter with other electrons and impart some of its energy. The electron escapes from the surface of the sample and loses energy corresponding to the material's work functionThe possibility of producing another photoelectron can happen either in step 1 or step 2:Step 1: if the photon has high enough energy, it can excite an electron from deep below the Fermi level ('core states'), leaving behind a hole. If the hole is filled by a lower energy electron (close to the Fermi level), this process will produce another photon which can photoemit another electron. This is the principle behind auger electron spectroscopyStep 2: the energized electron can collide with other electrons as it travels to the surface and impart some of its energy. If this energy is enough to exceed the work function and the second electron manages to make it to the surface, it can also be photoemitted. If the photon energy, and hence the first electron's kinetic energy, is very large, such a scattering event can happen multiple times and possibly lead to the photoemission of more than two electrons. This process, together with auger processes described above are utilized in photoemission electron microscopyFor more details on photoemission, see Inna Vishik's answer to Are the valence electrons of metal responsible for the photoelectric phenomenon?"

S' I get very excited for Nobel week every year, probably because this is a form of celebrity gossip which is socially acceptable among my cohorts. At the same time, it is pretty clear to anyone who does science thatmany important developments never receive a Nobel prizemany deserving scientists never receive a Nobel prize either because of politics or because of the limits on the number of people who can share onemany scientists (knowingly, eagerly) work on problems which are interesting and fundable but almost certainly won\'t yield a Nobel prizeNone of these points negate the value of big science prizes in general, but they do highlight the reasons that other research prizes exist and are considered very prestigious by practicing scientists. In physics, the names of a few such prizes can be found here. These prizes are chosen by a jury of knowledgeable scientists (like the Nobel, and unlike some billionaire funded \'contests\' which have emerged recently), and many of them honor contributions to a given subfield over a long period of time, rather than a singular discovery, which may be a better metric of a scientific productivity.As for the article in the question details, I disagree with some of its points, maybe because I am a physicist, not a biologist.Prizes tend to honor serendipitous discoveries. Serendipity plays a role in all of science, from the high school teacher who inspired one\'s initial interest, to the university/lab they decided to join in their PhD, to the procedure that they randomly decided to do on tuesday which led them to discover the effect that they published in their paper. Thus, I don\'t see the merit of discounting serendipity. That being said, Nobel prizes span the full spectrum between accident and billion-dollar-deliberation. For example, the 1987 Nobel prize in physics (high temperature superconductivity) was for a serendipitious discovery (though the recipients might argue otherwise), but you do not put 50,000 tons of ultra-pure water a half mile underground (Super-Kamiokande, part of the 2015 Nobel prize in physics) just to see if maybe something happens.Prizes de-emphasize replication and incremental progress. These ills are the faults of the funding agencies, not the prizes."The prize industry contributes to a deeper problem in scientific research: We throw resources at a privileged few who have already achieved enormous fame." If we are talking about the Nobel prize specifically, this is a ridiculous claim because there are so few Nobel laureates--maybe a hundred living ones per general research field (Chemistry, biology, physics), out of thousands of PIs in those fields. Moreover, a good portion of these receive a Nobel prize after they retire (see: Christopher VanLang\'s answer to How long do Nobel Prize discoverers need to wait to earn their Nobel Prize?), and many recipients become less active in research after being honored. Nobel laureates do help institutions attract better students, but this effect is secondary to the reputation of the institution itself. It is true that resources and funding are disproportionately provided to scientists who already have plenty, and this phenomenon is becoming much worse with the increased role of private philanthropy in funding research, but it is unlikely that prizes (especially not the Nobel) are a strong driver.'

S" Many people succeed at one or more outside ventures while pursuing a PhD in physics, so the first step is to behave like it is a natural thing to do and not seek validation on the internet.How you divide up your time will depend very much on how your research operates (do you have to come in at a specific time? Do you need to produce something to show your adviser every week?), so I can't offer a daily schedule, only general guidance.PeriodizenWith creative endeavors like PhD research, novel writing, and programming (when it is used to produce something, which is probably the best way to learn a new language), it is often not a good idea to work on it just two or three hours at a time. If you are creating something novel (no pun intended), you don't know what your next step is, and you might accomplish exactly nothing in three hours, other than collecting your thoughts. Not to mention how interruptions can further fragment the creative process. Instead, it might work better to prioritize project A for a period of time, say until an impending deadline, and prioritize project B for a period of time after that. For example, if you have an important presentation related to your PhD coming up, you should focus most of your time on that, and maybe use an hour or two in the evening for more 'brainless' activities related to your novel and programming, such as checking for typos and commenting your code. After the deadline related to your PhD research passes, you can try to work shorter days and spend more time on your novel for a fixed period of time.DeadlinesPressure makes diamonds, and sometimes peoples can only be productive if they have a pressing date on which they need to have something to show for their work. PhD research naturally has deadlines (sometimes soft ones) in the form of presentations, papers, applications, referee reports, and the start/end of a semester. If you don't have enough of these to make you productive, you might consider making new ones, such as volunteering to give a presentation at a student journal club or setting up a meeting with someone important that you need to be prepared for. As for your outside interests, those would benefit from real deadlines too (not something soft that you can back out of). Perhaps you could ask someone to read over a chapter of your novel (assuming you are not working with a publisher/editor already), such that you need to actually finish a chapter for them to read. SleepSleep is essential for being productive at creative endeavors, and many young people are delusional about how much they need, thinking they are one of those rare specimens who do fine with 4 or 6. You probably are not one of those people, and if you don't get enough sleep, you will end up wasting those extra two hours sitting at your computer not producing anything."

S" There are research groups and collaborations that strive to discover and/or engineer new high-temperature and/or novel superconductors. I previously discussed one set of strategies here. Because condensed matter physics, materials science, and solid state chemistry are empirical sciences, people search for new and/or high temperature superconductors based on known superconducting materials and physics which is understood about superconductors. Meanwhile, many other scientists work to understand unconventional and high-temperature superconductors that have already been discovered, in order to eventually formulate new pathways for engineering new superconductors. Below are some examples of recent systematic searches for high temperature superconductors:Searching for new high temperature superconductors based on iron-based high temperature superconductorsOne of the most important developments in superconductivity research in the past decade was the discovery of a new family of high-temperature superconductors: the iron-based superconductors. For four years starting March 2010, the person who discovered superconductivity in these iron pnictide materials, Hideo Hosono, led a consortium of 6 professors (mostly solid state chemists) in an effort to discover new (hopefully high-Tc) superconductors and engineer useful products out of iron-based superconductors. In the end, this group synthesized ~1000 new compounds, and superconductivity was found in several tens of new compounds. None of them had a high Tc, but they did have success in engineering wires out of iron-based superconductors for applications. This collaboration also emphasized publishing their failures--the compounds which were synthesized but not found to be superconductors--in order for future researchers not to waste time.

Based on this prediction, together with an understanding of what causes conventional superconductivity in metals, a group in a Max Planck Institute has searched for many years for superconductivity in hydrogen-rich gases which have been metallized under high pressure (albeit not as high of a pressure as is needed to metalize atomic hydrogen). They had a modicum of success when they achieved superconductivity in pressurized silane (SH4), but their big breakthrough came in the past year when they created a superconductor with a Tc of 203K by subjecting hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to very high pressure. This is the highest transition temperature achieved in any material ever. Although this search was based on known physics, the predicted Tc of H2s was only 80K, so this high Tc was a discovery and a breakthrough indeed.Brief description of the science: Inna Vishik's answer to What is the mechanism of sulphur hydride's high-temperature superconductivity?Original paper: Page on nature.comFree version: [1506.08190] Conventional superconductivity at 203 K at high pressuresH2S was compressed in a diamond anvil cell to make a high temperature superconductor. Image source: This New Superconductivity Research StinksSearching for new and high temperature superconductors at interfaces between two materialsThe first two methods for searching for superconductivity--playing with materials chemistry and applying pressure--are fairly 'traditional' methods. A different approach is to create novel physics at the interface of two materials. One well-known system where this has worked is the interface between lanthanum aluminate and strontium titanate (LAO/STO), where superconductivity has been discovered at 300 mK, even though both starting materials are semiconductors (review paper: Emergent phenomena at oxide interfaces). While this is not a high Tc by any stretch, this work brought this approach to a wider audience. More recently, researchers have found that a single unit cell of FeSe grown on STO has a Tc which far exceeds the Tc of FeSe as a bulk crystal (see: High-temperature superconductivity at the FeSe/SrTiO${}_{3}$ interface...I think this is the first report, but not 100% sure). The origin of this high Tc is still a topic of research and has been connected to charge transfer at the interface, interfacial strain, and interfacial electron-phonon coupling. This system is also a highlight of the approach of searching for high temperature superconductivity at interfaces.More info: Page on bnl.govMonolayer of FeSe on STO (right).

S" There are a couple of points in this questions and in the existing answers which need to be addressedCapacitive touchscreensTouchscreens operate like a bunch of parallel plate capacitors, where the capacitance C is given by [math]\\epsilon A/d[/math], where [math]\\epsilon[/math] is the permitivity of the dielectric material (how electrically polarizeable it is) between the two conducting plates (which are Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) films in the case of most smartphones), A is the surface area of the capacitive element, and d is the distance between the plates. The capacitance relates the amount of charge accumulated on the plates to the voltage between them: [math]C=Q/V[/math]. The position sensitivity comes from having a grid of parallel plate capacitors on the screen, and you can see this grid when you tilt your phone at certain angles in the correct light.Most modern touch screens work by modulating the charge on the plate, not by changing the distance between the plates. You can tell this is the case by trying to use your smartphone while wearing gloves: it simply won't work unless your gloves have conductive thread in the fingertips. Old school touch screens did/do operate by changing the distance between plates of a capacitor, which is why you had to press down hard 10-15 years ago. As such, modern touchscreens respond just fine to metal objects. I tried coins, keys, and bobbypins on my android, and the phone responded to all of them, though the gesture recognition algorithm seemed a bit confused at times.Touch screen mechanism is basically a parallel plate capacitor with (usually) ITO used in both plates. There is an additional external layer to protect the ITO from getting wiped off. image source: Capacitor Stylus pensThere are passive (the rubber tipped pens) and active styluses which operate by very different means. The passive ones can be substituted by a nail if you really want to risk scratching the screen. The active ones are little RF transmitters which give the phone/tablet information about the stylus's location and pressure. The active styluses, when they are operated in conjunction with certain programs or features, use software mechanisms to ignore gestures which do not originate from the pen."

S" Most of the top Kenyan runners come from a single tribe--the Kalenjin people (which make up a sizable minority of Kenya's population). Runners who win on the world stage in the modern era, regardless of their country of origin, are genetic freaks of nature. Still, there are certain physiological and cultural traits which happen more frequently among the Kalenjin which may explain why Kenya can successfully identify and groom to world's top male and female distance runners. Many of the arguments below are derived from The Sports Gene by David Epstein.PhysiologyThe Kalenjin people evolved in the hot lowlands and moved to the highland more recently, so their general physiology--longer and thinner limbs and shorter stature-- is optimized for dissipating heat. Heat dissipation is a big factor in success in distance running. Other important physiological factors are longer legs relative to the body height (for obvious reasons) and thinner ankles and calves (to decrease the energy required to swing the leg), which successful Kalenjin runners appear to have. Additionally, being born and raised at altitude (but not too high altitude--8000 feet or so) is thought to confer advantages in the blood's oxygen carrying capability which cannot be replicated simply by training at altitude as an adult.See also: Running economy : the forgotten factor in elite performance.Feedback loopThere are some factors which require an input of one or two successful runners (in this case, it was Kipchoge Keino* in the 1960s), which set of a cycle of excellence. Because running is seen internally as an important national sport, other factors arise which help maintain this.Young Kenyans see how their countrymen and women have successfully lifted their village out of poverty using the winnings from a few international races, and distance running becomes a mechanism for opportunity. In addition, college track teams in the US see the talent pipeline and recruit runners from Kenya. Thus, running also provides an opportunity to receive higher education abroad (e.g. Kenyas running pipeline to US schools is strong - The Boston Globe)With running being a popular national sport, it is more probable that the rare unicorns get identified and trained from an early age. In most countries throughout the world, the children with the proper stature and athleticism get funneled into soccer. In addition, I get the feeling that in the west, people have no idea about the ideal physiology for a distance runner, so they keep funneling kids that are way too tall into track.With the steady pipieline of top talent, training groups have more members which can push each other to maximize their natural talentCultural factors outside the feedback loopPain tolerance is another huge component in successful distance running, and some people speculate that a painful coming-of-age ritual (crawling through stinging nettles; getting circumcised with a sharp stick) practiced by the Kalenjin (perhaps historically? The linked article isn't clear how prevalent it is in modern times) may have contributed to sexual selection of a population with exceptional pain tolerance. See: How One Kenyan Tribe Produces The World's Best Runners*Kipchoge Keino Set Standard for Kenyan Runners in 1968Addendum: running to/from school (often barefoot, as the legend goes) is probably not a huge factor, at least in modern times. Kenyan runners get asked this all the time in interviews, and many of them deny running to school and indicate that they wore shoes."

S" The Fermi surface is the locus of zero-energy excitations in a metal. Superconductivity is a low energy electronic phenomenon, defined (in part) by a superconducting gap which is centered on the Fermi surface. The Fermi surface is determined by the number of charge carriers and the type of bonding the material undergoes, and it can be measured experimentally by a number of experimental techniques (see: Inna Vishik's answer to What kind of qualitative and quantitative information can be obtained from ARPES? and Inna Vishik's answer to What is the significance of the De Haasvan Alphen effect?)The pairing symmetry describes how the superconducting wavefunction transforms with respect to exchanging electrons. It has a spin and an orbital (spatial) component. The spin component is either singlet (Cooper pairs of opposite spin) or triplet (yes, this can happen too), and the corresponding orbital component must be even for singlet pairing (s,d,g wave) or odd for triplet pairing (p,f wave). The pairing mechanism (is superconductivity mediated by phonons or something else) is a distinct question, though certain pairing symmetries may favor one mechanism over another. (see: Inna Vishik's answer to What is a d-wave superconductor vs. an s-wave superconductor?)To answer the original question, to the best of my knowledge people cannot predict a pairing symmetry just by knowing a superconducting material's Fermiology without any further information. Once they have further information from thermodynamic, spectroscopic, and magnetic probes, they can narrow down the possible pairing symmetries, which can then be confirmed by order-parameter sensitive probes (spin susceptibility measured by NMR Knight shift and specifically constructed Josephson junctions are the gold standards for ascertaining the spin and spatial component, respectively, but a myriad of other techniques exist when these are not possible for whatever reason). Notably, any technique which experimentally measures superconducting pairing symmetry is implicitly looking at the Fermi surface (even if they don't know what the Fermi surface looks like) because superconductivity only affects the electrons very close to the Fermi surface.This paper (free preprint here)is a nice example of using a material's fermilogy, together with information from other experiments, to argue for some pairing symmetries over others via process of elimination."

S' There is nothing shameful about dropping out of a marathon. Powering through legitimate illness or injury on race day just to make it to the finish line (and the ER immediately afterwards) is much more foolish, and in my opinion, an action people should actually be ashamed about. In the absence of such an extreme situation, there is a lot of merit in dropping out after it is clear that you will fall far short of your racing goals, in order to save your legs for another race and/or more training.Elite runners drop out of races all the time because the damage they would do to their body by running an ill-fated race to completion is far worse than the embarrassment they would feel from failing to complete the race. Recreational runners can also adopt this rational attitude and see dropping out as an opportunity to do more training (starting right away because your legs are not as thrashed as they would be if you finished the marathon) and kick ass (however you define it) next time.See also:When To Drop Out Of A RaceThe DropoutWhy did Paula Radcliffe drop out of the marathon?'

Some people take umbrage at all women's running events because of the girly flourishes--cheap jewelry, truffles, all pink everywhere. I admit this is corny, but so are those races where people are expected to dress in a costume, so women's races are hardly the only culprits. Some people argue that in this day and age, where women already participate heavily in road races and only compete against other women for placement and prizes, all-women's races are a bit superfluous. Perhaps, but many of these races (not NWM) are organized by women-focused athletics brands (which need to exist in the marketplace because women have distinct apparel needs), so it seems more like a natural branding exercise to me. What did piss me off about the women's races I have participated in outside of NWM (and all this was in the bay area, so it may be a regional problem) is that 1) there was an overemphasis on praising mediocre accomplishments, like participating in the first place (is the implication that women are like elementary school children and need to be patted on the head and encouraged at every step?) and 2) the field was not very competitive, even by recreational-runner standards (which is probably related to point 1).This is not to say that all women-focused races suffer from the ills described above.

S" Superconductivity in [math]CaC_6[/math] (graphene layers with calcium atoms arranged in an orderly way between them) is a persistent phenomenon. There is basically one research group in the world which has claimed transiently enhanced (in one case room temperature) superconductivity under certain light-excitation conditions in other materials, and these results are very controversial in the research community. On the other hand, time-persistent superconductivity is a fairly ubiquitous ground state that many materials (some exotic and some mundane) realize at low temperature (and sometimes not super low temperature).Researchers have been thinking about how to make graphene superconduct for a while. Part of this stems from the sexiness of graphene among certain corners of the condensed matter research/funding community. But on the scientific side, graphene (and other carbon-based materials like buckeyballs and diamond) have an attractive feature for superconductivity: high frequency phonons (because carbon is a light atom which tends to form very stiff bonds). Unfortunately, most carbon-based materials are insulators or semimetals, which don't have enough electron density for phonon-mediated superconductivity to happen. This is why carbon-based superconductors need some other source of electrons. Diamond can superconduct if it is doped with a lot of boron. Buckeyballs can form fullerene superconductors when they are arranged into a crystal lattice together with alkali metal atoms. And graphene can superconduct if it gets extra electrons from calcium atoms, and the paper linked in the details studied the electronic structure of these materials using ARPES (see Inna Vishik's answer to What kind of qualitative and quantitative information can be obtained from ARPES?) which were discovered by a different research group and synthesized by a third research group.

S' Like all piercings, it hurts in the moment you are getting stabbed, but not too much afterwards, unless it gets jostled during the months long healing process. A conch piercing is subject to jostling if you have long hair, if you sleep on your side, if someone grabs your ear, or if you wear certain types of headphones. Some of these activities are hard to avoid, so expect a bit of pain, though not excruciating, in the first few months. Ear cartilage piercings nominally take 9 months or so to heal, but in my experience, the conch took a year or two to fully settle such that it was not easily perturbed by headphones, hair tangles, and side-sleeping.'

S' In my field, I wouldn\'t characterize most papers as being badly written, though minor mistakes like typos are more common than in a typical newsstand magazine. Part of the explanation for decent writing is that there is a uniform structure for journal articles, so people do not attempt unique exposition techniques which they do not have the rhetorical agility to handle. Additionally, it is common for papers to be read carefully by several sets of eyes: the co-authors, a friend/colleague not on the paper, the referees, and sometimes the editor.For the papers where the two factors above do not produce a readable manuscript these are some reasons why:The paper was rushed, because of pressure from competing research groups or to meet a deadline. As a journal referee, I read A LOT of papers in this stage of the revision process, and no referee who actually reads/cares lets a paper get published in an incomprehensible form. I suspect this factor is what plagues the CS papers in the answer details.Whoever wrote the paper is not a native speaker of English (assuming an English language journal obvi). This is where another set of eyes would be useful, but research groups based in other countries might not have access to native speakers, other than professional translation services. I\'m not sure how well professional translation services are equipped to implement some of the subtle exposition tricks used in scientific writing (e.g. "These data are not inconsistent with the following possible explanation...")Some papers are just so esoteric (even by the standards of basic research) that they probably won\'t be read/cited by many people.

S" The best route for making a high salary with a physics degree is to not work as a physicist--instead go into finance or a hot startup. This route is most natural for subfields which are very mathematical (fun fact: not all of physics is super mathematical) and also have a large computational component. If this is what you want to do, be a theoretical physicist of some sort (specific subfield not too important) but not the exclusively pencil/paper kind. Or better yet, don't major in physics if your primary goal is to make a lot of money.If your goal is to earn a good salary (or even a relatively high salary) while working as a physicist in academia (I can't comment on the options, if any, outside of academia), your subfield is not too important, provided it is a field which is expected to stay active in the near future (see: What are the most active fields of physics for graduate students to consider nowadays?). Your probability of earning a decent salary is higher if you end up being a professor (not some soft money position) at a top, private research institution (many public schools are fantastic for research, but the salaries are lower). Some fields have more positions than others, so your choice of subfield does have some impact on your liklihood of becoming a professor. Condensed matter and biophysics (especially experiment) seem to have comparatively good prospects, but other subfields probably do too (if you're really curious, go through all the listings here and see which subfields are most 'employable.') There are physics professors who make very high salaries (e.g. Steve Weinberg at UT austin), but this does not correlate with a specific subfield--it usually correlates with being a top talent in one's subfield and being willing to move for a higher paying position.If you are curious about specific numbers for physics professors' salaries, most public universities in the US publicly list all employees salaries as required by their state's law."

S" As a woman who will not tolerate a partner who does not have a Green's function for every situation, I fully understand your specific intellectual needs. Unfortunately, most professors move in social circles where it is common to have a spouse/serious girlfriend by age 30, so your pickings will be slimmer than you might assume from the stereotypically non-panty-dropping nature of the profession. Still, with the following advice, you might increase your chances for success.Narrow your search. There is a wide array of institutions of higher learning in the Boston area. Honestly assess what you are bringing to the table. Is it most compatible with a professor in a world-renowned research university or a commuter school? Narrow your search even more. One must be driven and focused in their chosen specialty to become a professor, so if you date one, you will hear about their work. Pick a department which does not bore you to tears.Carefully select your victim. Academic departments have one or more weekly colloquia where professors, students, and postdocs congregate to listen to research presentations. The professors sit in the front and they tend to ask more questions than junior people. Stalk these eager beavers and make a mental note of the ones who do not have wedding bands. Go to the department website and research the names and offices of your potential mates.Find out if your chosen prince is single (not all men without a wedding band are). A single professor will be in his office late in the evening and on weekends, and a married professor typically won't. You must gain access into their building and present yourself during these key hours.After these four steps, you can just do whatever the girly magazines suggest for catching a man's attention. I have no idea what this is, but presumably it involves dropping a writing implement on the floor or flipping your hair. Good luck!"

S" Difficulty (or more precisely, utter failure) is a common experience when trying to do a novel or challenging experiment. In the academic context, when one has already sunk money and/or time into a specific experiment, the goal is to make it work, even if the working form ends up being different or less ambitious than the initial conception.I view tinkering and conceptual re-evaluation as existing on a spectrum. On one end is the brainless moving of knobs and rebooting of random components in hopes of an easy fix; this is often what we default to for initial troubleshooting or out of crushing desperation. On the other end of the spectrum is completely redesigning the experiment from scratch, and one hopes it doesn't come to this. In between is where the most progress is made. It is hard to specify a course of action without knowing the specific experiment and the specific difficulty, but I can give some general advice.Get organized. Make a list of the things that might be going wrong, and formulate a strategy for isolating/troubleshooting each of these variables.Get some sleep. It is easy to get into a rut of trying things, failing, and then trying a similar thing, and this cycle can sap your creativity. If you just leave it for the night, you might come back refreshed the next day with new ideas.Talk to people. Others might be able to solve your difficulty: they might have unique expertise that you don't have or they might have the benefit of a fresh set of eyes. Even if they can't solve your problem, the act of articulating the problems with your experiment can clarify the difficulties in your own mind.Be patient. Sometimes it can take months to troubleshoot a problem with an experimental setup and/or a funky result.Make it work. Experiments often fail, but (in academia at least) it is important to still have something to show. Sometimes this involves pivoting on the problem you are studying. For example, if you were trying to measure a tiny signal in system A, you might look for a system B with a larger signal, even if it is a bit less spectacular. It is good to have these sorts of backup plans when formulating a research problem. Sometimes making it work means changing your goals entirely. Instead of trying to measure a tiny signal in system A, you might write a paper about the upper limit of this tiny signal based on the capabilities (characterized by other means) of your experiment."

A similar device which people are probably more familiar with is a damping dashpot which is sometimes installed on heavy doors to make them close more slowly (see image below)--when you try to close these doors faster than they are designed to go, they offer resistance.Image sourcecutout of pneumatic table leg.

S' In solids and liquids, heat can be transported by both atomic lattice vibrations (specifically, acoustic phonons on a crystalline solid, which generalize to sound waves in a liquid) or free electrons. In addition, liquids can support convective heat transfer.Liquids have lower thermal conductivity than solids because at the atomic scale, they are basically disordered solids. Disordered solids also have poorer thermal conductivity than solids with a high degree of crystallinity because acoustic phonons are scattered at imperfections such as lattice dislocations, impurities, and grain boundaries. Metals tend to have higher thermal conductivity than non-metals (try putting your hot coffee in a copper mug) because the former has free electrons to carry heat and the latter does not.For the specific case in the question, glass vs mercury, the glass in the question likely does not have a high degree of crystallinity at the atomic scale, which limits its lattice thermal conductivity. In addition, it is an insulator (and a pretty good one if it is transparent), which limits its electronic thermal conductivity.'

The question details indicate that you are a ChemE major. If your ChemE curriculum was like my undergrad friends', it included courses in quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and electromagnetism. Thus, you are in a better position than most people with your same question. Still, taking a MOOC (or even better, a course at your university) in these three subjects may be helpful in demonstrating that you have taken the courses in the form that physicists like to teach them. Research experience is a must for anyone applying to a PhD program in the US, because research is the 'job' you are being 'hired' to do.If your research interests overlap with ChemE, EE, or materials science at all, you might consider also applying to those PhD programs (as a parallel, not alternate strategy) in a school which is liberal about allowing cross-departmental PhD advising.

S" Sort of. Electrons in a metal undergo fluctuations which are mathematically similar to Brownian motion.There are several models to describe electrons in a metal. The simplest model is the Drude model, which treats electrons like a gas of classical particles which collide with each other leading to resistivity. Of course, electrons are quantum mechanical objects, and the next level of 'rigor' treats delocalized electrons as waves labeled by their momentum state. Further corrections introduce interactions between electrons and the ion lattice and electrons and other electrons. Although each successive theory is more 'correct' than the former, each model has some degree of truth and/or usefulness in it. As such, physicists often simultaneously have several descriptions in mind when trying to understand condensed matter phenomena. The entire preceding paragraph is background for the following disclaimer: Brownian motion is a classical phenomenon, but electrons are not classical. Still, there is a phenomenon in metals called JohnsonNyquist noise (sometimes just Johnson noise) which is directly analogous to Brownian motion via the Fluctuation-dissipation theorem (which applies equally to quantum and classical systems). The easiest way to think about Johnson noise is by adopting a classical picture of electrons in a solid (which I will do below), though it can be described quantum mechanically as well.Every resistor (and all real metals show some resistance) has noise at finite temperature which is proportional to the resistance (which itself is a function of temperature) and the temperature--this is Johnson-Nyquist noise. In a classical picture, this arises from an increased number of collisions when ions are moving around more energetically (increased temperature) or when there are more impurities introduced into the metal (higher resistance at the same temperature). The analogy to Brownian motion is that a particle in a fluid will also tend to jostle around more when collisions are more probable: higher temperature and higher mobility of the particle. This analogy isn't just handwaving, it arises from the fluctuation dissipation theorem, which states that thermal fluctuations of a physical variable are directly related to impedance (dissipation) of the same variable. Stated in another way, viscous drag of a particle through a fluid arises from the same phenomenon which causes it to jostle when there is no external force applied: discrete collisions with fluid molecules. Similarly, the scattering events that an electron encounters as it traverses a metal under an applied voltage are the same scattering events it encounters in the absence of a voltage. The difference is that electrons are quantum mechanical, but this is one of the beautiful things about physics: sometimes you encounter very different systems which are described by the same mathematics."

Don\'t copy and paste the abstract, because you will likely need to include more background.Third paragraph: explain significance of findings. This is the most important paragraph, and what you write here will depend on the type of journal you are submitting to. For journals which strive for more \'high impact\' papers, one emphasizes how this work is an important discovery or how it solves important problems in the field. For specialists\' journals, one might emphasize how this work will be a resource for future researchers in the field. Closing sentence/paragraph: sometimes one includes: "This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere." Sometimes one gives evidence that this will likely be a well-cited paper: "We have presented parts of this work in several major conferences of the field, and almost every time it has become a central highlight...". Usually close with: "Thank you very much for your consideration."Sincerely, Corresponding Author (which isn\'t always the same as first author and/or the person submitting the manuscript)In addition, some people include a list of "excluded" referees (e.g. people with a conflict of interest) at the end of the letter: "Due to the conflict of interests caused by directly competitive nature of the research, please do not ask following individuals to review the paper." Some journals have a separate section in the submission procedure where this information can be provided.The easiest way to construct a coverletter is to work off one that a colleague has successfully used for the same or a similar journal. It is not clear how much they actually sway the editors\' decision to send a manuscript out for peer review, because the importance of a work is very hard to judge by someone outside the field, other than through external signifiers like the authors\' reputations.

S" Among some sectors of the experimental physics community, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is perceived as being more capital intensive than other small-lab-based experimental techniques. This characterization isn't necessarily accurate, because most small-lab-based physics experiments are 'expensive'* these days since most experiments are quite specialized and don't enjoy any economies of scale.The main factor potentially driving up the cost of STM is vibration isolation. If you want to study atoms on sub-atomic length scales and maintain position registry 1000 atoms away, you need to make sure that the STM tip does not vibrate relative to the sample too much. It should be noted that vibration isolation is not always a money sink. For some types of experiments, it is sufficient to just build the STM on a floating table in a lab space which is situated on the buildings' foundation (basement if there is one, first floor if there isn't). For more extreme vibration isolation, one needs to float the entire lab floor on which the STM sits (plus one or two more vibration isolation systems on top of that), which quickly escalates costs. In addition, an STM experiment which requires that much vibration isolation is likely to be operated at very low temperatures, so throw a dilution refrigerator on top of that.*the word 'expensive' needs to be qualified here: I mean several hundred thousand up to several million dollars. This is expensive by most civilian price scales, but is much cheaper than large facilities like the LHC, and much cheaper than most types of federal expenditure. Thus, it actually represents a good bang-for-the-buck as far as science funding is concerned."

Brewer correctly pointed out, researchers primarily use liquid helium to cool down high temperature superconductors, though applications of these materials strive to operate with much cheaper liquid nitrogen. There are a number of reasons that researchers use liquid helium:Many high temperature superconductors (e.g. all Fe-based HTS materials and several important cuprate HTS materials) have transition temperatures below the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. Physicists have different standards than normal people as to what constitutes high temperature.Some experiments strive to measure ground state properties, and some experiments would suffer from unacceptable noise/broadening if they were conducted at liquid nitrogen temperatures. See: Zhun-Yong Ong's answer to Physics: Why do scientists crave to reach the absolute zero?Many experiments use cryostats designed to be operated with liquid helium (to study those materials which don't do anything above liquid nitrogen temperature), and it is often non-trivial to operate these machines with a different cryogen.So how much liquid helium do researchers use to study high-Tc? This is highly variable. As I discussed at the end of this answer, there are two general types of cryostats (excluding mechanical cryocoolers): a bath cryostat where the sample is in thermal contact with a bath of liquid helium (surrounded by a vacuum jacket and a liquid nitrogen jacket; so if an experiment uses a bath cryostat, it will require liquid nitrogen, perhaps 100L per week of cold operation) and a flow cryostat where the sample is in contact with cold helium gas. In all cases, the experimental setup has a lower temperature limit, and the sample is in thermal contact with a heater to raise it's temperature above this lower limit if needed. The amount of helium that an apparatus uses depends on several factors including: The quality of thermal insulation from the environmentThe thermal mass of the object one needs to cool downIs optical access required? At very low temperature, radiation is a big source of heating, so experiments which have a port to admit light will require more helium and will have a higher base temperature.The operation temperature and cooling procedure of the specific experimentTo throw some numbers out there, I have primarily worked with flow cryostats in experiments that required optical access, and one helium dewar (100 L) lasted 3-7 days at base temperature (5-10K). These numbers are not necessarily applicable to any arbitrary experiment, because of the factors listed above. However, it should be noted that helium is a non-renewable resource on earth (and it is completely asinine to mine He-4 in space), so most labs try to conserve as much helium as they can. The best way to do this is to re-compress and re-use helium, and many labs/institutions are installing helium liquifiers (which typically use a bit of liquid nitrogen to condense impurities in the helium) to address the scarcity of this singularly important research tool."

S" There have been ~8 years in which the Nobel Prizes in Physics has been awarded for breakthroughs in superconductivity and closely related phenomena. Not to mention the many awards for experimental and theoretical techniques which are crucial for studying superconducting materials. Additionally, high temperature superconductivity is one of the most important unsolved problems in condensed matter physics (though not the only one; condensed matter is not defined by a singular problem, which makes it such a vibrant field). Still, many condensed matter physicists (including Nobel laureates) do not believe that there will be a Nobel prize awarded for a theoretical explanation of the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity*. Why is this?Seemingly every theorist thinks that they solved it already, with some data supporting their explanation and other data refuting it.It is debatable if there is a Nobel-worthy breakthrough to be had there. For instance, if the mechanism is just a different 'pairing glue' (e.g. spin fluctuations instead of phonons), BCS theory already permits this.There might be a Nobel prize to be had related to other aspects of high-temperature superconducting materials, such as strong electron correlations.So why do people continue to study high temperature superconductors? First of all, most scientists are not driven by dreams of winning a Nobel prize. When they start working on a difficult problem, they have no idea if their solution will work, and if they do find a solution, there is often no way to know if their insight is important, because that is predicated on how it influences the field in the future. That is to say, if you write 'winning a Nobel prize'** as a goal on your statement of purpose for graduate school admissions, the committee will assume you are a lunatic and toss your application in the trash. People work on high temperature sueprconductivity because it is a special problem in condensed matter physics which has enough richness of research problems and materials to sustain decades of activity--there is a lot of new physics to be learned***. In the relatively short time I have been an active researcher, I have seen other materials systems (and small sub-topics in high-Tc too) get discovered, become trendy, and get resolved all in a matter of a few years. Meanwhile, high-Tc perseveres as a source of deep research questions and field-specific research prizes.*High temperature superconductivity in research-speak refers to two specific materials systems: cuprate high temperature superconductors (which superconduct above liquid nitrogen temperature) and iron-based superconductors (which superconduct below liquid nitrogen temperature, but above 30K). The highest superconducting transition temperature ever is in H2S under high pressure (203K). This is not discussed in the context of high-Tc because 1) it was discovered last year and our language has already been solidified 2) it's mechanism is understood (it is a conventional BCS superconductor).**If winning a Nobel prize is really your goal, then condensed matter physics is a great field to be in, because there are an infinite number of potential research questions with new ones being invented all the time.***Another such system is VO2, which features an insulator-metal transition near room temperature which people have struggled to explain. Ed Caruthers studied this in his PhD decades ago, and people are still making discoveries worthy of high-impact publications to this day."

S" My advice is in the context of a race, intended for recreational runners who want to achieve good performance.TrainingIf you formally train for races, there are training plans available online, or you can hire a coach (in person or online). This is not necessarily a requirement for recreational runners. However, you should run to prepare for a running race (not bike, not elliptical, not swimming), and you should not run an entire 5K at race pace during training. If you want to have 5K-pace running in your program, this should be in the form of shorter intervals (400m-1 mile). Running every run in its entirety as fast as possible is a recipe for burnout and/or injury.Longer runs are important, even for a 5K. Professional 5K runners typically have 16-20 milers in their training program. A serious recreational runner might have 10-20 milers. If covering the full distance is not an issue for you and you want to improve your performance, run some 5-8 milers at least.Race daySeed yourself correctly at the starting line. If you have no estimate of your projected finish time, do not line up right at the front, and do not toe the start line unless you are likely to place in the top 10. This is a courtesy to other racers, but you will benefit if you surround yourself by people going at a similar pace. If you are not sure where to stand, ask the people around you their projected finish time and move up/back accordingly.Pace yourself correctly. Do not sprint the first 200m like an 8 year old. You will likely achieve your optimal finish time if you run close to an even pace, assuming consistent terrain.Dress for the occasion. If it is 60 degrees outside, dress like it is 85, because you will get hot as you run. If it is 85 outside (not unlikely since many 5Ks are during the summer), prepare to run slower than you might wish. If you usually run with a water bottle, don't be afraid to carry one during the race, even if people around you don't have them. At the same time, you don't need to pack your gear belt like you are a mule commuting across the desert; a 5K isn't that long.A warmup is helpful for a shorter distance race. This might involve jogging from your home instead of driving (if feasible), or it might involve jogging around the starting area for 5-20 minutes."

S' One method to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes on a rooted tree is by storing the [math]2^k[/math]th parent of each vertex.Suppose that for each node on the tree, we knew two quantities:The depth of the node (that is, the distance of the node from the root)The [math]2^k[/math]th parent of the node for all [math]k[/math] upto [math]\\log N[/math]The depth and the [math]2^0[/math]th parent can be easily calculated using a dfs: 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\nchar seen[NMAX];int depth[NMAX];int parent[LGNMAX][NMAX];vector<int> adjlist[NMAX];memset(seen, 0, sizeof seen);memset(parent, -1, sizeof parent);void dfs(int u) { seen[u] = 1; for (int i = 0; i < adjlist[u].size(); ++i) { int v = adjlist[u][i]; if (seen[v]) continue; depth[v] = depth[u] + 1; parent[0][v] = u; dfs(v); }}Once the [math]2^0[/math]th parent is found, the rest of the parent array can be filled in easily.1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nfor (int i = 1; i < LGNMAX; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) { if (parent[i - 1][j] != -1) { parent[i][j] = parent[i - 1][parent[i - 1][j]]; } }}I will explain how to find the LCA using these quantities in [math]O(\\log N)[/math] per query. As an example, consider the following graph where we want to find the LCA of the vertices [math]u=8[/math] and [math]v=9[/math].The first thing to note is that the depth of the LCA is going to be less than or equal to the depth of both vertices. Thus if the depths of the two vertices are not equal, we can make them equal by going up the ancestry tree of the further vertex as much as necessary. We can use the parent[][] array to do this in [math]O(\\log N)[/math] time, essentially by looking at the binary representation of the height we have to jump:1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nint getparent(int u, int k) { for (int i = 0; i < LGNMAX; ++i) { if (k & 1) u = parent[i][u]; k >>= 1; } return u;}In this case, we go up to 7 from 9.At this stage, if the two vertices under consideration are the same, we are done (would have been the case if we started with 7 and 9, for example). If not, we need to find the smallest number [math]x[/math] such that the [math]x[/math]th parent of [math]u[/math] is the same as the [math]x[/math]th parent of [math]v[/math].To do this, we can use the parent[][] array again. Find the largest value of [math]k[/math] such that the [math]2^k[/math]th parent of [math]u[/math] and [math]v[/math] are different, and update [math]u[/math] and [math]v[/math] to be those parents. Continue till [math]k=0[/math], and it is easy to see that the vertices we end up with will be just below the LCA.Again, we are essentially building the distance from the vertices to the LCA bit-by bit. Here is the full LCA function including the height-adjustment: 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\nint LCA(int u, int v) { // Adjust the heights if (depth[u] > depth[v]) { u = getparent(u, depth[u] - depth[v]); } else if (depth[v] > depth[u]) { v = getparent(v, depth[v] - depth[u]); } // If the vertices are now same, we are done if (u == v) return u; // Go as far up as you can such that vertices are different for (int i = LGNMAX - 1; i >= 0; i--) { if (parent[i][u] != parent[i][v]) { u = parent[i][u]; v = parent[i][v]; } } // Parent of u (or v) is now LCA return parent[0][u];}The depth-first search takes [math]O(N)[/math] time, and the following parent array computation takes [math]O(N \\log N)[/math]. Both the getparent() and LCA() functions need to be run at most once per query and take [math]O(\\log N)[/math] each. Thus the overall time complexity of the solution is [math]O((N+Q) \\log N)[/math] and the space complexity is [math]O(N \\log N)[/math]. There are algorithms which can find LCA in linear space and time with a different preprocessing, but they are conceptually harder and this one should be enough for most competitive programming applications. In any case, here is a link with an explanation of the [math]O(N)[/math] solution : Range Minimum Query and Lowest Common Ancestor'

S' This problem can be solved using the Convex hull trick.Consider the square of the distance from a producer at [math](a,b)[/math] to a point on the x-axis [math](x,0)[/math] where a consumer could be located. This is equal to [math](a-x)^2+b^2=a^2+b^2+x^2-2ax[/math]. We need to find the [math](a,b)[/math] pair for which this quantity is minimised. Since [math]x^2[/math] is same for all producers once the consumer is fixed, we will try to minimise the remaining quantity [math]f_{(a,b)}(x) = a^2+b^2-2ax[/math] over all [math](a,b)[/math] pairs for given [math]x[/math].First, note that [math]f_{(a,b)}(x)[/math] is a is a linear function of x for each [math](a,b)[/math]. The problem is thus all about picking from a set of lines the line with the lowest height at a certain x-coordinate.Consider the above image as example. We have four lines [math]l_1 \\ldots l_4[/math]. Initially, it is [math]l_1[/math] which is the lowest line. Then [math]l_2[/math] takes over, and finally [math]l_4[/math] becomesthe winner. For the given query location [math]x[/math], [math]l_2[/math] is the line with the lowest height at that point.So how do we find the lowest line for the points efficiently?We will make a few observations. First, note that if two lines are parallel, only the lower one ever has any chance to be the lowest line at any point. So discard all but the lowest line out of sets of parallel lines.Next, note that in the figure, the lines which attain minimal height have monotonically decreasing slopes from left to right. This should not be surprising : A line with a higher slope can never become lower than a currently lower line by going further to the right. So we will first sort all the lines in decreasing order of slope.We will now scan this sorted list from left to right and build up the list of lowest lines and the coordinate ranges for which they are lowest. Keep a stack to store the candidate lowest lines. Initially push the first line to the stack. The initial candidate range at which this line is lowest is [math](-\\infty,\\infty)[/math].While processing an element [math]l[/math], first check the intersection of the line with the line [math]m[/math] at the top of the stack. If the intersection point is before the candidate range at which [math]m[/math] is the lowest, it means that [math]m[/math] can never be the lowest line for any range (This is what happened to [math]l_3[/math] in the above figure) - so pop m off the stack. Continue popping elements till you find a line where the intersection point [math]p[/math] lies in its candidate range. Update the right limit of the candidate range of the line as [math]p[/math], and push the current line to the stack with candidate range [math][p,\\infty)[/math].Once this preprocessing is done, finding the lowest line at a given x-coordinate is simple. We can binary search over the ranges of the candidate lines and see which one [math]x[/math] falls in. Alternately, we can sort the x-coordinates of the consumers first and scan the ranges from left to right.Pseudocode: 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\nGiven : (a[i],b[i]) for i=1 to M : x[j] for j=1 to Nfor i = 1 to M line[i].index = i line[i].slope = -2 a[i] line[i].intercept = a[i]^2 + b[i]^2endsort line[] in decreasing order of slope, breaking ties in increasing order of interceptstack sline[1].range=(-inf,inf)push line[1] to stackfor i = 2:M if slope[i] == slope[i-1] continue while (c = x-coordinate of intersection of line[i] and s.top) <= s.top.range.left pop from s s.top.range.right=c line[i].range=(c,inf) push line[i] to stackendfor j = 1 to N binary search on s to find line[i] such that x[j] lies in line[i].range output line[i].indexendComplexity of the solution is [math]O((N+M) \\log M)[/math].'

S' If all the numbers were powers of a certain prime p, how would you solve the problem?Let the numbers be [math]p^{e_1}, p^{e_2} \\ldots p^{e_N}[/math], with [math]e_1 \\geq e_2 \\geq e_3 \\ldots e_N[/math]. The gcd of a subset is just the smallest power of [math]p[/math] in the subset. For making things simple, when there are multiple equal numbers, we will say that the highest index number is what is chosen as the gcd. That is, if [math]e_1=e_2[/math], we will say that [math]\\gcd(p^{e_1},p^{e_2})[/math] is actually [math]p^{e_2}[/math].With this, let us see how many subsets [math]p^{e_i}[/math] is the gcd of. Clearly, [math]p^{e_1}[/math] is the gcd of only the set [math]\\{p^{e_1}\\}[/math]. [math]p^{e_2}[/math] is the gcd of only the sets [math]\\{p^{e_2}\\},\\{p^{e_1},p^{e_2}\\}[/math]. In general, [math]p^{e_i}[/math] is the gcd of [math]2^{i-1}[/math] subsets.Thus the product of gcds of all subsets is[math]\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n (p^{e_i})^{2^{(i-1)}} = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n p^{e_i 2^{(i-1)}}[/math]The products have to be done modulo the prime [math]P=10^9+7[/math]. Also note that [math]a^b \\equiv a^{b \\bmod{(P-1)}} \\bmod{P}[/math].In the more general case, the trick is to deal with primes individually.First, sieve up to the limit ([math]10^5[/math]) and find all primes in the range - there are less than 10000 of them - and the smallest prime factor for each number. This can be used to factorise the numbers efficiently. For the primes [math]p_i[/math] which are found, keep a list [math]e(p_i)[][/math] which stores the prime powers as above.For each [math]A_i[/math], find its prime factorisation [math]p_1^{q_1} p_2^{q_2} \\ldots p_k^{q_k}[/math]. For each such [math]p_i[/math], add [math]q_i[/math] to the list [math]e(p_i)[/math]. After all the [math]N[/math] numbers have been processed, use the procedure above for each prime to find the gcd product. The product of the gcd products of all primes gives the required answer.ExampleSuppose the array is [math]1,2,3 \\ldots10[/math]. The primes in the range are [math]2,3,5,7[/math]. After processing all the 10 numbers we find for each prime:2 : [math]e[2]=\\{3,2,1,1,1\\}[/math] : Subset gcd product = [math]2^{35}[/math]3 : [math]e[3] = \\{2,1,1\\}[/math] : Subset gcd product = [math]3^8[/math]5 : [math]e[5] = \\{1,1\\}[/math] : Subset gcd product = [math]5^3[/math]7 : [math]e[7] = \\{1\\} [/math] : Subset gcd product = [math]7^1[/math]The required answer is just [math]2^{35} 3^8 5^3 7^1 \\equiv 622607273 \\bmod (10^9+7)[/math]'

S' Using the fact that K is very small (10), we can compute this efficiently using matrix exponentiation.Define [math]f(N,K)[/math] to be the the number of solutions of [math]1 x_1 + 2 x_2 \\ldots K x_K = N[/math]. Let us first find the recurrence for [math]f(N,K)[/math].Let [math]i[/math] be the largest value such that [math]x_i > 0[/math] in a solution. The number of such solutions for given [math]i[/math] is just [math]f(N-i,i)[/math] since the remaining sum of [math]N-i[/math] has to be made out of terms [math]x_1 \\ldots x_i[/math]. Summing this quantity over all values of [math]i[/math] gives the total number of solutions. That is, [math]f(N,K) = f(N-1,1) + f(N-2,2) \\ldots f(N-K,K)[/math].Now, note that evaluating this recurrence naively would take [math]O(NK)[/math] operations, which is too much for the given constraints. So we will reduce the complexity by using matrix exponentiation.Define the vector [math]v(N) = [f(N,1) \\ldots f(N,K) \\ldots f(N+K-1,1) \\ldots f(N+K-1,K)]^T[/math].[math]v(N+1)[/math] can be found from [math]v(N)[/math] by multiplying it by a recurrence matrix [math]M[/math]. The first [math]K(K-1)[/math] rows of [math]M[/math] would just shift elements of the vector up whereas the last [math]K[/math] rows would implement the recurrence found above.For example, when [math]K=2[/math], the matrix equation would look like this:[math]\nv(N+1)\n= \\begin{bmatrix} f(N+1,1) \\\\ f(N+1,2) \\\\ f(N+2,1) \\\\ f(N+2,2) \\end{bmatrix}\n\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} f(N,1) \\\\ f(N,2) \\\\ f(N+1,1) \\\\ f(N+1,2) \\end{bmatrix} \n= M v(N)\n[/math]Since [math]v(N+1) = M v(N)[/math], we have [math]v(N+x) = M^x v(N)[/math]. If matrix multiplication is performed in [math]O(L^3)[/math] where [math]L[/math] is the size of the matrix, the matrix power can be found in [math]O(L^3 \\log x)[/math] using exponentiation by squaring. Thus after finding the values of [math]f(N,K)[/math] for [math]N \\leq K[/math] using the recurrence, matrix exponentiation can be used to find the solution in [math]O(K^6 \\log N)[/math], which should be efficient enough for the problem.'

S' The present beef issue in India is not about religious harmony or tolerance at all. It is all about the rise of political Hindutva ideology.Just like in this question, the beef issue in India is reduced to a Hindu-Muslim issue. In addition to Muslims, many other groups of Indians eat beef. These include Indians from regions like the north-east and Kerala, from other religions like Christianity, and even Dalits.In many parts of India, beef-eaters and cow-worshippers have been tolerating each other for centuries. In places like Kerala, the issue of tolerance did not even come up since even Hindus eat beef. And in many parts of India, Muslims and other minorities have been abstaining from beef partly out of tolerance and partly out of fear for their lives.Political Hindutva wants to extend that last state of affairs to the rest of India. It is all about enforcing the will of one section of society over the others. There is nothing about religious harmony or tolerance in this. I had written a similar answer on this topic.Basically a cow is a material item and not a purely religious object. Real tolerance would be accepting that it means different things to different people. As much as it is an object of worship for you, it is a source of milk and meat for me. Tomorrow, if a more extremist group comes along and tells you that the cow is so holy to them that you should not milk it, would you give in to them in the name of tolerance? If that seems absurd, understand that the demand of stopping eating the cow sounds the same to beef-eaters.Whether I eat beef or not, you get to live the same way. You still get to worship the cow and you still get to not eat beef. When you ask for others to live their lives based on your beliefs, it stops being about communal harmony and tolerance and starts being a political power game of imposing rules on others. When political parties with no standing start asking for beef bans in places like Kerala, it is time to realise that it has become cultural oppression, trying to paint the whole of India in one narrow brush. When political groups start using beef and love-jihad and such scare tactics to raise communal issues, consolidate Hindu votes by portraying Muslims as the other and win elections, it is just a political tool.Giving in to such forces and accepting a nationwide beef ban, for example, would go against the very idea of pluralism and tolerance in India.'

Have you invented that plant growth potion yet?R25 : Actually I am doing Physics. You know, you grow up and things change.

And I write code and do theory to study this. There is so much of exciting Physics stuff.R11 : Oh, so you just sit in front of the computer all day? You don't go to the lab and do experiments?

It is so bad to have only one hour of computer science in school. I have to share a computer with two other students, I am allowed to play games only once in a term, and now I have to learn programming too - it is so hard.R25 : Well, it gets quite boring to play with computers all day. You will be doing a lot of programming, so pay attention to that. And don't worry about the computers at school. You will get your own in a couple of years, and the first thing you do will be deleting everything useful in that.R11 : So where do you do PhD? In CUSAT?R25 : Actually I am at EPFL. It is a university in Switzerland.R11 : Switzerland, you live in Switzerland? How is it living outside Kerala? How did parents let you live away, weren't you scared?R25 : Hey, don't get so excited.

S" Use linearity of expectation.We are essentially asked the following problem:You are given N objects [math]0 \\ldots N-1[/math] with specified weights [math]w_i[/math]. At each step, you pick an object out of the remaining ones with probability proportional to its weight and discard it. How many steps will it be before object 0 is picked?To solve this, find this first : What is the probability that object i is chosen before object 0? This is clearly [math]\\frac{w_i}{w_0+w_i}[/math] since the other objects don't matter while deciding the relative ordering between object 0 and object i.Using linearity of expectation, the expected total number of objects picked before object 0 is just the sum of probabilities of picking each of them before object 0. That is,[math]E = 1 + \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N-1} \\frac{w_i}{w_0+w_i}[/math]Intuitive, isn't it? Although I have to admit that hindsight is 20/20. I thought of this only after seeing the solution, and perhaps couldn't have come up with it myself during the contest."

S' This problem can be solved using dynamic programming over subsets (using bitmasks).SolutionThe first thing to note is that [math]b_i < 2 a_i - 1[/math]. This is because, had the inequality not been satisfied, we could have replaced [math]b_i[/math] with [math]1[/math]. This would have resulted in the value of [math]|a_i-b_i|[/math] reducing, without affecting any pairwise gcds. Thus all [math]b_i[/math]s lie between [math]1[/math] and [math]58[/math].One way to make all [math]b_i[/math]s pairwise coprime is by ensuring that prime factors of any element do not divide any other. Since there are only [math]16[/math] primes upto [math]58[/math], we can do dynamic programming over the subsets of these primes.Define [math]\\rm{DP}(i,S)[/math] = minimum value of [math]\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{i} |a_j-b_j|[/math] on choosing [math]b_j[/math]s such that their only prime factors are the prime numbers in the set [math]S[/math].Let us find a recurrence for [math]\\rm{DP}(i,S)[/math]. [math]b_i[/math] can be any number in the range [math]1 \\cdots 58[/math] whose prime factors are all in [math]S[/math]. Let [math]j[/math] be one of such numbers, whose prime factors form the set [math]T \\subset S[/math]. It is clear that the cost due to the current element is [math]|a_i - j|[/math]. Also, the minimum cost you can obtain from the previous elements is clearly [math]\\rm{DP}(i-1,S \\setminus T)[/math] since none of the factors of the current element can be used in previous elements. This gives a total of [math]|a_i - j| + \\rm{DP}(i-1,S \\setminus T)[/math], and minimising it over all [math]j[/math] gives us [math]\\rm{DP}(i,S)[/math].The base case of the recurrence is clearly [math]\\rm{DP}(0,S) = 0 \\;\\forall\\; S[/math]. With this base case and the above recurrence, [math]\\rm{DP}(n,\\{2,3,5 \\cdots 53\\})[/math] gives the minimum cost.ImplementationSubsets are usually represented by bitmasks in dynamic programming. If set [math]S[/math] has elements [math]a_1 \\cdots a_n[/math], its subsets can be represented by [math]n[/math]-bit binary numbers. The bijection between subsets and bitmasks is that element [math]a_i[/math] is present in the subset iff the [math]i^{th}[/math] bit of the mask is [math]1[/math]. For example, the subset [math]{a_1, a_3, a_6}[/math] corresponds to the mask [math](100101)_2 = 37[/math] (Bits are read from right to left).We start with the set of primes under 58.1\nint p[16]={2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53};In our solution, we require the factor set for each number. To do this easily, we precompute the factors in mask form. 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\nint factormask[59];for(int i=1;i<59;i++){ //Initialise with the empty subset factormask[i]=0; for(int j=0;j<16;j++) { if(i%p[j]==0) { //p[j] is a factor of i //We need to set the jth bit of mask to 1 factormask[i]|=(1<<j); } }}With this done, we can dive into the recurrence. Note that, in addition to the [math]\\rm{DP}(i,S)[/math] variable we defined in the solution section, we also need to find the best value of [math]b_i[/math] so that it can be output in the end. For this, along with [math]\\rm{DP}(i,S)[/math], we keep another variable [math]b(i,S)[/math] which stores the value of [math]b_i[/math] which gives the minimum for [math]\\rm{DP}(i,S)[/math]. We will do the DP by memoised recursion to avoid calculating some unnecessary values. 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\nint DP[101][1<<16],b[101][1<<16];memset(DP,-1,sizeof DP);int calc(int i,int mask){ //Base case if(i==0)return 0; //Check for memoisation if(DP[i][mask]!=-1) return DP[i][mask]; //Start by assigning 1 to current element //1 has no prime factors, so mask passed is unchanged DP[i][mask]=calc(i-1,mask) + abs(a[i]-1); b[i][mask]=1; //Now consider all values j from 2 to 58 for(int j=2;j<59;j++) { //Ensure that all factors of j exist in mask : This is true iff (mask&factormask[j]) == factormask[j] if((mask&factormask[j])!=factormask[j]) continue;  //Factors of j can be removed from mask using (mask^factormask[j]) int cur=calc(i-1,mask^factormask[j]) + abs(a[i]-j); if(cur<DP[i][mask]) { //We found a better j DP[i][mask]=cur; b[i][mask]=j; } } return DP[i][mask];}We can now call calc(i,(1<<16)-1) and then build the [math]b_i[/math]s in the end. 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n//(1<<16)-1 is the mask corresponding to all the 16 primesfullmask=(1<<16)-1calc(n,fullmask);//Build the b_i s backwardsvector<int> b_out;for(int i=n,mask=fullmask;i>0;i--){ int cur=b[i][mask]; b_out.push_back(cur);  //Remove the factors of cur from the mask and continue mask^=factormask[cur];}Output b_out in reversed order and we are done.'

S' This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.First, define our DP function as best(i,j) = minimum distance sum for the first i villages on placing j post offices such that there is a post office at village i.Let us see how we can compute best(). We will start with the base case best(i,1). This means that all villages from 1 to i have to be assigned to post office at i. Thus we have1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nbest(*,1)=0for i=1 to N for j=1 to i best(i,1)+=dist(i,j) endendHere, dist(i,j) is just the distance between villages i and j.Next let us look at the recurrence for best(i,j) for j>1. Since we know that the last post office is at village i, we just consider all possibilities for the location of the previous post office and take the one which gives the minimum cost1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nfor i=1 to N for j=2 to K best(i,j)=best(i-1,j-1) for k=1 to i-2 best(i,j)=min(best(i,j), best(k,j-1)+cost(k,i)) end endendHere, cost(k,i) = minimum distance sum for assigning villages in the range k...i to post offices at village k and i. Note that if we evaluate this naively using a loop from k to i here, the overall complexity of the routine would become O(N^4). We can take care of this by precomputing cost() before the best() recurrence evaluation [1].1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\ncost(*,*)=0for i=1 to N for j=i+1 to N for k = i+1 to j-1 cost(i,j)+=min(dist(i,k),dist(j,k)) end endendThus, both cost() and best() can be evaluated in O(N^3) which should be enough for the given constraints.Now what is the final answer? The last post office could be anywhere and the remaining villages have to be sent to it. We just choose the position which gives the minimum sum: 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\nret=best(N,K)for i=1 to N-1 cur=best(i,K) for j=i+1 to N cur+=dist(i,j) end ret=min(cur,ret)endreturn ret[1] There are alternate ways to take care of this without precomputation. One is to interchange the k and j loops in the evaluation of the recurrence for best(). Do you see how evaluating cost(k,i) inside would then not worsen the asymptotic complexity?'

S' No. All Indian citizens are equal irrespective of whether their citizenship was attained by birth or by naturalisation. This is one thing that I really love about the constitution of India.Article 84 of the Constitution of India describes the eligibility criteria for members of parliament:A person shall not be qualified to be chosen to fill a seat in Parliament unless he -a) is a citizen of India, and makes and subscribes before some person authorised in that behalf by the Election Commission an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule;b) is, in the case of a seat in the Council of States, not less than thirty years of age and, in the case of a seat in the House of the People, not less than twenty-five years of age; andc) possesses such other qualifications as may be prescribed in that behalf by or under any law made by Parliament.There is no other law made by the parliament that prohibits foreign-born individuals from becoming members of parliament, and thus it is not required that the MP be born in India. Articles 74 and 75 describe the provisions regarding the council of ministers and the Prime Minister, and there are no additional eligibility criteria there.That is, a foreign-born citizen who satisfies the eligibility criteria can become the Prime Minister of India.'

S' The authority that feminism has to fight in India is tradition and religion. Indians - men and women alike - value these so much that any changes are resisted if they question them, even when they are beneficial. Had injustice been inflicted by an external authority, people would have found it easy to protest.The two major religions in India are Hinduism and Islam. The former proclaims that women do not deserve freedom (Na sthree swathanthryam arhati [1]), and the latter tells its followers that men are caretakers of women (Arrijalu qawwamoona ala nnisai [2]). We happily put women on a pedestal, worshipping them and placing heaven at their feet. We treat them as precious things which should be protected, even at the cost of their freedom. The very basis of feminism that men and women are equal and deserve to be equally free goes against the foundations on which the Indian society is built. Questioning this foundation would make a lot of the structure that is built on it come crashing down.In comparison, the constitution of India treats gender equality as fundamental. Not that it doesn\'t have its faults, but it was a manuscript way ahead of Indian society at the time it was written, and I believe even today. The nation of India was born with universal adult franchise and no legal barriers for women from occupying even the highest constitutional posts. When the law is significantly more progressive than the society, feminist fights have to be more social than political - and this is extremely difficult.Coming back to the social aspect, sexual purity of women is ridiculously overvalued in India. Part of this is the need to ensure that her offspring are from the same religion and caste as her - or rather, her protectors. The entire caste system in India has survived millenia due to endogamy. Women\'s genitalia are the locks to safekeep family honour. All this means that girls\' freedom is significantly curtailed to keep her sexually pure, which ironically leads to more sexualisation of women and sexual violence. How different would India have been without arranged marriages?Think about just one "feminist" goal : sexual freedom for women. Every woman should be able to decide what she does with her sexuality. She should be able to freely date and marry people she chooses. To me, this is a very fundamental and reasonable expectation of freedom. But we have feminists being labeled as promiscuous sluts for this.That has always been the narrative. Reasonable demands by feminists have been represented as extreme. When women started going out for day jobs, they were painted as heartless and selfish people who wouldn\'t cook for their husbands (poor man, how can you expect him to work in the kitchen and cook for himself) or care for their children. Women joining politics were portrayed as wanting women to dominate men. Those advocating clothing freedom and social freedom were depicted as scantily clad and getting drunk in nightclubs with men. Think about all movie stereotypes about feminists from a couple of decades ago. We just cannot imagine a family and social structure where women do not live their traditional roles.To me, that is the basis of the problem. The society simply cannot accept even the basic, reasonable demands of feminism. Men are afraid of not only losing their privilege but also worried about the women they were "entrusted with". On the other hand, women have to constantly confront breaking their tradition and religion, and also worry about the consequences of losing the "protected" status - the backlash for violating the social status quo can be serious and violent. As a result, feminism is caricatured and misrepresented as extreme, and both men and women are afraid of identifying with it.The number of women in our parliaments and slate legislatures is abysmal [3]. The literacy differential between genders is more than 16% [4]. We still kill our children for being born female. Those claiming that women have equality (or more-than-equality) in India are closing their eyes to the social reality. Irrespective of how feminists are labeled and stereotyped, the feminist movement will continue to confront the social structure to make things better.[1] Manusmriti 9:2[2] Quran 4:34[3] The 545 : A Brief History (Or The Lack Thereof) Of Women In Parliament[4] Census of India : State of literacy'

Saudi Arabia prohibits public practice and proselytism by followers of other religions, conversion from Islam, and atheism. Such actions by a theocratic state are clear human right violations. I wish that Saudi Muslims and the international community would put pressure on the Saudi government to change such laws.I have seen some Muslims justify this practice by saying that it is the law of the land, but the point is that such a law itself is unjust. Section 377 is the law of the land in India, but the existence of the law does not make persecution of gays just. At least the Muslims who believe that they should have the right to practice and propagate Islam and build mosques in non-Islamic nations should support the same rights for non-Muslims in Islamic nations as well.Finally, I hope that people living in secular nations like India would realise that such oppressive laws in nations like Saudi Arabia are not a model to be followed but avoided at all costs. The number of people saying "If Saudi Arabia has laws for X, why don\'t we introduce similar (replacing Muslim with Hindu) laws in India?", even on Quora, is downright scary.'

S' The (u,v) th element of the k th power of the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph gives the number of paths of length k between u and v.This is easily proved by induction. The case k=0 is straightforward. The k th power of the adjacency matrix A is just the identity matrix, and the number of 0 length paths between u and v is 1 iff u=v and 0 otherwise. Alternately, you can take k=1 as the base case and note that the number of 1 length paths between u and v is given by the (u,v) th element of A.Now, consider the (u,v) th element of [math]A^{k+1}[/math]. This is equal to the sum of [math]A(u,w) A^k(w,v)[/math]. Since [math]A(u,w)[/math] is non-zero and equal to one for precisely the neighbours of w, this expression is equal to the total number of paths between v and the neighbours of u with length k. But every such path corresponds to a u-v path of length k+1 since each such path consists of an edge from u to its neighbour, followed by any k length path from the neighbour to v. We have thus proved the inductive step.Finally, note that the matrix exponentiation has to be performed using exponentiation by squaring to reduce the number of matrix multiplications needed from O(k) to O(log k).'

S' Because the earth is too light/the moon is too far.When a celestial body revolves around another, its orbital speed depends upon the the mass of the central object ([math]M[/math]) and the orbital radius ([math]a[/math]) [1] through:[math] v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{a}},[/math]where [math]G[/math] is the gravitational constant. Using [math]M_{\\rm{sun}} = 2 \\times 10^{30} \\rm{kg}[/math] and [math]a_{\\rm{earth}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{11} \\rm{m}[/math] we obtain the orbital speed of the earth-moon system around the sun to be 30 km/s.Plugging in [math]M_{\\rm{earth}} = 6 \\times 10^{24} \\rm{kg}[/math] and [math]a_{\\rm{moon}} = 3.8 \\times 10^{8} \\rm{m}[/math] shows that in comparison, the orbital speed of the moon around the earth is merely 1 km/s.That is, even when the orbital velocity of the moon around the earth is opposite to that of the earth-moon system around the sun, it is too small to make it seem to move in the opposite direction when viewed from the sun. The situation would have been very different if the earth were a thousand times more massive.In fact, the orbital speed of Jupiter around the sun is just 13 km/s, whereas its moon Io orbits Jupiter at 17km/s. As a result, it would be seen as retrograde from the sun.Notes:[1] We assume here that the orbitting object is much lighter than the other, and that the orbits are circular. When these conditions are not satisfied, the equation becomes slightly more complicated but the results do not change qualitatively.'

S' Yes, I would let a doctor who got in through reservation treat or operate me and my loved ones.Here are the reasons why:1. The medical entrance examination tests candidates on a lot of things which are completely irrelevant to their career as a doctor.Take a look at the syllabus (pdf) for AIPMT : There are many topics like electromagnetism, thermodynamics and botany which have nothing to do with the knowledge or skills a doctor requires. Many physics topics would be difficult for students who are weak in mathematics but would make excellent doctors. Given that even a difference of a few marks results in a huge change in ranks, there is going to be a serious lack of correlation between the ranks and the aptitudes of students. In general, especially with the abundance of coaching centres, entrance examinations do not check how good an engineer/doctor/scientist the student would become but how well they have prepared for the particular examination. I am quite confident that I could have aced the medical entrance if I had prepared for it, and I am equally confident that I would have made a very shitty doctor.Post-graduate entrance exams have less problems with irrelevant topics, but still suffer from flaws. Candidates are not tested on their surgical or diagnostic skills but on knowlege of topics alone, and this suits better learners than better doctors or surgeons. There is still the issue of coaching and dedicated preparation making a big difference in the exam without making a significant difference further on.2. Even if the student gets a seat through reservation, to become a doctor, they have to clear their courses like everyone else.If a student gets into an MBBS programme through reservation, this does not guarantee that they will become a doctor. They have to learn their subjects and pass exams and have their medical rotation like everyone else. They get their degrees only if they pass all their subjects satisfactorily. I see no reason to use entrance examination scores as a better marker for their ability as a doctor than their performance at the medical college.3. Reservation picks the top candidates from the respective categoriesReservation does not mean that you provide a seat to the worst candidates or someone totally random. There are still category-wise ranks and the top students from each category are the ones getting in through reservation (top based on whatever metric the exam uses, not necessarily top doctors as argued above). Had the number of seats been increased, most of them would have got in without reservation itself. Many a time, the reason to keep cutoffs and entrance exams is just to pick a handful of candidates from a large group. If there are only 100 seats for a course or a job, it does not mean that candidate #101 was unfit for the job - they would have got in if there were 101 seats instead. Especially in the context of India where there are way more qualified candidates than there are educational/employment opportunities available, I would argue that the number of prospective good doctors we have is many times the number of seats and it is all right to pick the best SC/ST/OBC candidates even if they are not at the very top of the rank lists.There would be a difference between reserved and payment seats in this last point. Someone with a lot of money could buy a seat or job in spite of being the absolute worst of the lot, and there would be no one to stop them. Still, the outrage is always against reservation and rarely against these seats. One wonders why.PS: I support caste-based reservation in education and employment. My various answers on the topic on Quora can be found here.'

S' I don\'t think so.There is a lot of anti-Indian content on Quora. When I see those, I report them. Quora admins are quick to act on such content (random example) and block/ban the askers. I have found them very receptive to the problems faced by Indian users and I feel that there is a genuine effort to make Indians feel at home on Quora.But unfortunately, many Indian users on Quora have the same kind of behaviour. There is a lot of content from Indian users that violate various policies, especially "Be Nice, Be Respectful" policy:Examples of behaviors that violate the "Be Nice, Be Respectful" policy include:Personal attacks, including hurtful, insulting, or hostile comments.Making unjustified accusations against other user(s).Engaging in a pattern of behaviour that constitutes harassment of a targeted person or persons, e.g., by making threats, repeated annoying and unwanted contacts, repeated personal attacks, or posting personal information.Racial, sexual, homophobic, ageist, religious, political, ethnic, or other epithets directed against another contributor.Using someone\'s affiliations as a means of dismissing or discrediting their views (this does not include pointing out a conflict of interest of relevance to the discussion at hand).Speculating on the real life identity of an anonymous user.Even prominent users are not immune to this. Some users who write very good answers on some topics indulge in appalling racist/sexist/homophobic behaviour in other topics, and often make personal attacks. I have reported content from multiple top writers for violating policy.In that way, users\' actions on Quora mirror the real world. How many times have we seen very respected individuals at the top of their fields end up saying absolutely uncivilised things? Many prolific users end up doing the same on Quora too. This is not just about your views being controversial. Saying that a certain religious practice affects the society negatively could be a controversial thing, but Quora is not going to kick you out for that. But Claiming that a certain group of people are lesser humans and deserve fewer rights is not a mere controversial belief, your proclaiming it on Quora alienates other contributors and makes their Quora experience significantly worse. The moment you stop talking ideas and start attacking people, you are not making Quora a better place.And Quora does not take those things lightly. The way I see it, they are happier to lose a few prolific contributors who act like this than alienate an entire group of people. I believe that this is the right thing to do too. There are lots of spaces on the internet where you can say absolutely horrible things about individuals and their identities with no consequence, and I am glad that Quora is not one of them. I have not felt that the policy violation banhammer falls on Indians unjustly and disproportionately. If there are users who you feel have been banned unjustly, go through their edit log and you will probably be able to figure out why the ban happened.'

The result is obvious if [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] have opposite signs. So let us consider the case when [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] have the same sign. Without loss of generality, take [math]a,b \\geq 0[/math].Consider a triangle with two sides of lengths [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math], with the angle between the sides equal to [math]\\gamma=60^\\circ[/math].Schematic of the triangle [1].According to the Law of cosines, we have [math]c^2 = a^2 - ab + b^2[/math]. Since the square of the third side has to be positive, we have our result.In fact, we can use the same result for other values of the angle [math]\\gamma[/math]. Considering all the angles in the range [math]\\left[0,\\pi\\right][/math], we obtain that [math]a^2 + x a b + b^2[/math] is always positive for [math]-2 \\leq x \\leq 2[/math].Alternately, you can think of this as being a weighted mean of two positive numbers [math](a-b)^2[/math] and [math](a+b)^2[/math] with positive weights and is thus positive.[1] Image source: Wikimedia Commons.

S" Because the first clocks were made in the northern hemisphere. At northern latitudes, the shadow of a sundial moves clockwise through the day.Before the advent of watches and clocks, sundials were used to measure time. One common way to build a sundial is to have a rod pointing in the direction of the pole (north/south, depending on the hemisphere), and tracing the motion of the shadow would give you the time [1].Sundial at Kingussie, UK [2].Now, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. At northern latitudes, this means that the tip of the shadow of the sundial moves clockwise. When people from the northern hemisphere invented watches, the hands were made to follow the direction of the sundials. This is why we have clocks which move clockwise. However, in the southern hemisphere, the motion of the shadow is reversed.Sundial at Perth, Australia [3]. Note how the hour markings are anticlockwise.Things would have been different if clocks were invented in the southern hemisphere. We would have had a different definition for clockwise!Notes:[1] There would be small seasonal corrections due to the ellipticity of the earth's orbit.[2] Image source: Wikimedia Commons.

S" These are Diffraction spikes.The shared image was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope which is a reflecting telescope. Reflecting telescopes have a secondary mirror which stands right in the path of the incoming light.Schematic of a Cassegrain telescope [1].This is required to take the light collected by the primary mirror out of the telescope system where it can be read. But this creates a problem since the secondary mirror can't clearly be floating in space. It is thus held in place using a support structure.Support structure for the secondary mirror of a Newtonian eflector [2].Light from strong point sources diffracts around the supporting structure, causing diffraction lines in the image which depend on the shape of the support arrangement.Diffraction spikes produced by various support arrangements for the secondary mirror [3].This is what happens with the Hubble images as well [4]:The cross shape visible on bright objects (such as stars) in Hubble images is a form of distortion that is visible in all telescopes that use a mirror rather than a lens to focus light rays. The crosses, known as diffraction spikes, are caused by the lights path being disturbed slightly as it passes by the cross-shaped struts that support the telescopes secondary mirror. It is only noticeable for bright objects where a lot of light is concentrated on one spot, such as stars. Darker, more spread-out objects like nebulae or galaxies do not show visible levels of this distortion.If you look closely, you can see that the lines emanating from the stars in the four directions are not of uniform intensity but show intensity oscillations typical of diffraction.Sources[1] Source: Wikimedia Commons.

S' Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama\'at is a denomination of Islam.Mirza Ghulam Ahmed [1].This sect was founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. He claimed to be the Islamic reformer of the fourteenth century and the promised Messiah in Islam. Though Ahmadi Muslims accept most of the teachings of mainstream Islam, there are a few controversial beliefs which make them different from the rest of the Muslim community, with the most important difference in the belief about Jesus. Most Muslims believe that Jesus was spared from crucifixion and is alive in heaven. But Ahmadiyya belief is that after escaping crucifixion, he moved to Kashmir and lived and died there. Thus Jesus was not the Mehdi awaited in Islam, and Ahmad himself was.Needless to say, Ahmadi beliefs are highly controversial in the mainstream Muslim community. The belief that Muhammad is the last prophet is central to mainstream Islam, and the status of Mirza Ghulam Ahmed in Ahmadiyya belief is unacceptable to non-Ahmadi Muslims. Most Muslims consider Ahmadis to be heretics and Kafirs. As a result, they face persecution in many Islamic nations, especially in Pakistan. The first Muslim Nobel Winner Abdus Salam had to leave Pakistan when Ahmadis were declared as non-Muslims by a constitutional amendment. After his death, his tombstone was defaced to remove the word "Muslim".Abdus Salam\'s tombstone, defaced to remove the word "Muslim" [2].Qadiani is a religious slur used to refer to Ahmadi Muslims, based on Mirza Ghulam Ahmed\'s birthplace. Avoid this word.Dawoodi Bohras are a completely different group. They are a sect of Shia Muslims.[1] Source : Wikimedia Commons. Image in Public Domain.[2] Source: Wikimedia Commons.

S' This is a tricky dynamic programming question.Let us start with a naive DP solution of high complexity.Definewin(i,j,k)=1 iff player i could have emerged as the survivor after battles involving only players in the clockwise range from j to k (that is, if j>k, the range wraps around n)Clearly, i has to fall inside [j,k] for win(i,j,k) to make sense. Also, the clockwise range is taken as linear even if it spans the full circle. For example, if n=5 and j=3,k=2, the range looks like [3,4,5,1,2]; and 3 cannot fight 2 until everyone in between has been defeated.We need to find a recurrence for win(i,j,k). The last duel has to be won by i. The opponent of this duel has to be some muskeeter i\'. Without loss of generality, suppose the i\' is situated clockwise to i. Consider all the musketeers who lost to i\' or lost to someone who lost to i\' and so on. It is easy to see that all these musketeers have to be situated in a contiguous segment [k\',k] for some value of k. Similarly, before i defeated i\', all the musketeers who lost to i or lost to someone who lost to i and so on, form another contiguous segment [j,k\'-1].Thus we obtain the recurrence:win(i,j,k) = 1IFFthere exist i\', j\' : ji\'j\'<i and win(i\',j,j\')=1 and win(i,j\'+1,k) = 1 and i defeats i\'ORthere exist i\', k\' : i<k\'i\'k and win(i\',k\',k)=1 and win(i,j,k\'-1) = 1 and i defeats i\'We are essentially looping over all possible last opponents and the segments they have conquered individually. The complexity of this recurrence to fill the win(i,j,k) table is O(N).Can we do better?Yes. the important thing to note is that the players to the left and right of i are independent. Since they do not "talk" to each other, everything to the right can be finished off before the left, or vice versa. This suggests that we can split our win function into two:rightwin(i,k) = 1 iff i could have emerged as the survivor after battles involving only players in the clockwise range from i to kleftwin (i,j) = 1 iff i could have emerged as the survivor after battles involving only players in the anticlockwise range from i to jIt is easy to see that win(i,j,k) = leftwin(i,j) AND rightwin(i,k).The recurrence for rightwin(i,k) is essentially the same as beforerightwin(i,k) = 1IFFthere exist i\', k\' : i<k\'i\'k and rightwin(i,k\'-1)=1 and leftwin(i\',k\')=1 and rightwin(i\',k)=1 and i defeats i\' The leftwin recurrence is symmetric. The tables rightwin(i,k) and leftwin(i,j) can be filled in O(N) and thus, win(i,j,k) can be computed for all values in O(N).It seems we can still do betterFor this, we have to finally use the fact that the range wraps around. Suppose we want i to win. Imagine all the players standing in the circle and duelling each other till only two are left : i and some i\'. All the musketeers between i and i\' (clockwise) have to be defeated by one of them (or someone who defeated them...). Similarly, all musketeers between i\' and i (clockwise) have to be defeated too.Thus we modify the definition of our rightwin function slightly:rightwin(i,k) = 1 iff i and k can defeat everyone in the range (i,k) togetheri can survive the full set of duels if there exists some i\' such that rightwin(i,i\') = rightwin(i\',i) = 1 and i can defeat i\'. It is easy to see that, with cooperation, our recurrence simplifies further:rightwin(i,k) = 1IFFthere exists k\':i<k\'<k such that rightwin(i,k\') = rightwin(k\',k) = 1ANDi or k can defeat k\'We can evaluate the rightwin(i,k) table thus in O(N) time. Since N100, this should be quick enough.'

S' Less than a Giganewton.Back of the envelope order-of-magnitude estimation time.The power that the earth receives from the sun is of the order of S = 1 kW/m^2. Radiation pressure exerted on a surface is the incident power divided by the velocity of light c [1]. The total force that is exerted on the surface can thus be found by multiplying the solar constant by the effective area of the earth A and dividing by c.F = S A / c= (1 kW/m)  (  (6  10 m)) / (3  10 m/s) [2]~ 10 - 10 NHow big is this force? Burj Khalifa weighs 500,000 tons. The total gravitational attractive force between the building and the earth is thus mg = 5  10 N. The radiation pressure force that the sun exerts on the earth is thus weaker than the gravitation force due to one building on earth.Meh.Notes:[1] This is for a perfectly absorbing surface. For a partially reflecting/transmitting surface, there will be an extra pre-factor which we neglect since this is an order of magnitude estimate.[2] We are treating the effective area of the earth as a uniform disk. Once the curvature and reflection are considered, things get more complicated.'

S' If the city blocks are coloured black and white alternately like cells of a chessboard, every street connects a black block with a white block.Let us first state the problem in graph theoretic terms. We will denote the blocks by vertices of the graph and the streets by edges between them. The problem then reduces to this : Given the degree of every vertex in a graph but one, find the degree of that vertex.Now, for a general graph, it turns out that this problem cannot be solved. To see this, consider the two graphs below:Both graphs have vertices A and B with degree two. But vertex C in the graph on the left has degree two, whereas in the one on the right it has degree zero. Thus the solution is not unique in general, and we cannot find it just from the other values.But it turns out that in this particular case, we can indeed find the degree of the missing vertex. This is because the graph of blocks and streets is bipartite. Colour the blocks black and white alternately, as in a chessboard. Every street then connects a black block and a white block. That is, the total number of streets ending on black blocks has to be equal to the number ending on white blocks. Coming back to the graph theoretic formulation, the sum of degrees of black vertices is equal to the sum of degrees of white vertices. Using this, the degree of the missing vertex can be found easily.For example, in the sample case, assume that the central (missing) vertex is coloured black and has degree X. The sum of degrees of black vertices is 2+3+X+1+0 = 6+X, whereas the sum of degrees of white vertices is 2+1+3+1=7. Equating, we find the sample output X=1.'

S" Most Indian Muslims have not read Bhagavad Gita.Many of them would have come across the more famous verses, but very few would have read it from beginning to end. I will go ahead and say that most Indian Muslims have not even read the Quran with the meaning from beginning to end, rather than merely reciting it in Arabic.Religion is mostly transferred from generation to generation rather than chosen personally. Most Indians are Hindus and Muslims and Christians simply because their parents were too and brought them up with the same religion. Their religious identity has little to do with their understanding of their own religious texts, leave alone a comparative analysis of religious texts from other religions. Most people would have come across mythological stories from their religions and others' too, but heavier books are a totally different matter.However, Indian Muslims do respect the Bhagavad Gita as a holy book of the Hindus. They do not consider it holy themselves, but do understand that it is something important for the Hindus. Except for those indulging in proselytizing, Muslims in general do not go about denigrating Gita or comparing it with the Quran. Since they don't read it and don't consider it something to follow, the question of respecting the teachings is moot.Muslims do have an issue with Gita being imposed on them as a part of saffronisation of education though. Why wouldn't you just keep your religious texts to yourself?"

S' Indian athletes and sportspersons end up close to last in many Olympic events. Rather than being ashamed of them, we still support them and award them sporting honours. The list of Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and Arjuna awardees consists of multiple individuals who failed to win a medal at the Olympics. But they are still the best we have got, and they have done their best at the highest levels of the competition.The case of Indian ACM ICPC teams is not very different.I was in a similar situation a few years ago. Abhimanyu, Pratik and I threw everything we could at the problemset, but ended up close to the bottom of the table. We had a particularly bad day, as we should have been able to solve 3-4 problems with our knowledge and might have ended up closer to the middle of the table on an average day.Everyone has such bad days. I have seen my very bright students end up without a medal at the IOI. I am quite sure that the Delhi team would have done far better on their average day. They did not get to the World Finals through a lottery, they did very well in the Indian regionals and got their deserved place to represent India and their college at the World Finals. This is truly the highest level of the competition, the competitive programming equivalent of the Olympics. If the best that India can offer can only do so well (the best Indian team this year ranked 69), it is plainly unfair to blame a team on what is a national problem.Why does India do so badly on such contests? This question would need a long answer. To summarise, competitive programming in India is still a very young and narrow field, and students are rarely encouraged and motivated to follow it. Nobody gets to spend their energy towards such pursuits in school since their purpose is to be fodder to the JEE machine, and they do not get faculty guidance even once they enter college. At some level, competitive programmers in India are a group of amateurs who are there just due to personal motivation and their peer groups, and they pretty much learn the whole thing on their own. Would you expect a self-coached athlete who starts practicing a few years before the Olympics to win a medal there?Things will change eventually. Hopefully, the competitive programmers of our time will become faculty at colleges and start coaching the next generation systematically. Hopefully, competitive programming will start picking up at school level and there will be consistent programming culture in colleges rather than sporadic highs when a few good participants happen to be in the same year. Faculty and seniors and the expanding online content dealing with competitive programming will then be able to coach students to the top level. When that happens, I believe that Indian teams will be as good as anyone else.Till then, I will celebrate our best teams today instead of shaming them. Satwant, Kunal and Archit - well done and good luck for the next time.'

S' Stop blaming Muslims for the electoral losses of BJP.The last time UPA won the elections at the national level was in 2009. Since you have to be 18 to vote in India, everyone who voted in that election had to be born in 1991 or before. Muslims formed 12.61% of the population of India according to the 1991 census. Even when all the deaths between 1991 and 2009 are taken into account, there would have been six to seven non-Muslim voters for every Muslim voter. It is a pretty unequal contest, don\'t you think?.How do Muslims vote anyway? Here is the CSDS data from the 2007 election.Source: Indias 2009 Elections: The Resilience of Regionalism and EthnicityLess than half of the Muslims voted for UPA. Under the assumption that voter turnout is proportional to the population percentages, this means that barely 6% of the total votes polled were Muslim votes which went for the Congress. That year, Congress by itself received 28.55% of votes as opposed to BJP\'s 18.80%. UPA received 37.22% of votes compared to NDA\'s 24.63% and less than a sixth of the UPA votes were from Muslims. Even without a single Muslim vote, Congress and UPA would have clearly outperformed BJP and NDA by a huge margin.There are multiple other trends to be seen. Sure, Muslims did not vote much for NDA - but neither did SCs who form a much bigger chunk of the population. STs mostly voted for UPA as well. On the other hand, most of the upper caste votes ended up with NDA. UPA had near-universal approval, with at least a quarter or more votes from all groups but one. Why are these trends never under scrutiny and only Muslims have to answer every time that BJP loses/Congress wins?Even when AAP won in Delhi this time, there were people claiming that Muslims were behind it. Seriously, this has got to stop. No party can come to power in India on Muslims\' votes alone. And Muslim votes are no more or less misguided than Hindu votes in India.Now that we have established that Congress does not come to power "riding on the Muslim vote bank",How do Muslims feel when Congress comes to power?Well, the Muslims who voted for Congress would have felt pretty good - just as the Hindus would have. Running the country is serious business, and it is nice to see the people you voted for doing it. Similarly, the Muslims who voted against Congress would be feeling bad. I am going to wager that educated Muslims are going to be way more pissed about the claims floating around that Congress won on Muslim vote bank than on the fate of their own vote.Personally, I kind of feel relieved when Congress wins at the national level. As much as I hate their corruption and dynasty rule, they are the lesser evil with a chance at the national level. I disagree with both the social and economic policies of NDA. There might be better parties at the state level in various states, but none of them have the critical mass for the whole of India.Finally,How can BJP get Muslims to vote for them?This is kind of going to be hard. The first thing they have to do is kick some nutcases out of their party. People like Sakshi Maharaj and Yogi Adityanath make at least one statement every week which translates to "Don\'t vote for us" for non-Hindus. They spew venom and continue to keep positions in the government. If BJP deals with these folks seriously, people are going to take note.Go easy on the saffronisation of everything. Stop trying to impose religion as culture on secular India. Leave the school kids and science out of your political games. And stop trying to rewrite history blaming everything from Sati to the caste system on Muslims.Offer true secularism as an alternative if you feel that Congress is a false secular party. Showing off yourself as a party of Hindus and going for majoritarianism is not doing yourself any favours. Ditch majoritarian laws like insane punishments for possession of beef which affect non-Hindus disproportionately.Next, you need to shave off some of your appendages. BJP grew up as the political wing of RSS, but it is time to reform the RSS and the Sangh Parivar. It is high time that BJP started controlling RSS instead of the other way round. VHP and Bajrang Dal are not making you any dearer to the minorities. Deal with those groups and their leaders like Pravin Togadia sternly.Try to attract Muslims at the party level and mentor them politically. If you have active Muslim members at the grassroot levels and sufficient number of Muslim faces at the state and national levels, it will help you reach out to more Muslims who are not yet open to the idea of BJP.Finally - and most important - go for inclusive development. It is relatively easy to bump the GDP by going top heavy. But there are millions of Indians at the lowest economic strata who have not been too well served by the governments till now. These people are composed of a disproportionately high number of SC/STs and Muslims. By coming up with policies that improve the status of these groups, you have a good chance of getting their votes - and that would mean a lot of Muslim votes.Heck, if you do all this, I will vote for you. Of course, if you do all this and manage to gain some Muslim votes, you might lose the support of hardliners who voted for you only to teach Muslims a lesson. I have no clue how to keep both groups. Good luck with the balancing act!Seriously folks, stop getting worked up about vote banks. Every individual gets one vote, and they have their own reasons to vote. Every voter has different needs, and expects different things from their government. If you plan to form a government, it is your job to provide people what they need the most. People don\'t become a vote bank when they don\'t vote for you just because you can\'t provide it.'

S" Restaurants are extremely expensive in Switzerland. Go to an average restaurant and have an average main dish, and it will cost you 20-25 CHF. Some restaurants give you a student discount, but the price even after the discount is going to be pretty high.The first cheap option you have is fast food restaurants. If you don't care too much about your health, there is a McDonalds in every corner of town that you can use (and other chains like Burger King, though less common). There are also a lot of Doner Kebab shops, and the food there is relatively cheap as well. Having a decent meal in either of these places should cost you under 10 CHF.Since you are a student, you might be lucky if your campus has decent restaurants. EPFL for example has half a dozen restaurants where you can have a very good meal for 8 CHF. The meals are usually balanced as well as tasty, and having so many restaurants on campus with multiple items on the menu guarantees sufficient variety.The cheapest and healthiest option, of course, is to cook for yourself. Buy raw materials from the nearest Migros. Look for Action (items on discount) or the M-Budget items (which are essentially permanently on discount). You should be able to obtain most spices there too, and the more exotic ones can be purchased from the Asian stores. Cooking large-scale and having multiple meals (or sharing with others) would be the way to go. This should be quite cheap - even if you eat non-veg, you can reduce the price per meal to 4CHF or less. I cook my royal pairing - chicken biriyani and shrimp roast - for 7/8 meals with around 30 CHF.Sticking to this routine, you should be able to keep your food expenses per month under 250CHF.

S" Let me turn the question on its head:Muslims, Christians, Dalits and Keralites eat beef. Hindus consider the cow sacred and worship her. The first group is tolerant enough to let the second group do as they please. Why can't the second group return the favour and show this tiny amount of tolerance?It all depends on what you consider as tolerance. For me, tolerance is about letting others follow their way of life - not about changing your own habits. When X and Y - people of different religions - live together,X not allowing Y to follow their religious practices is intoleranceX letting Y follow their religious practices is toleranceX changing their personal habits to suit Y is unnecessaryNon-Hindus giving up beef would fall under the third category.Ask yourself the question : Does someone else eating beef affect your personal practice of religion in any way? You are not being forced to eat beef, and you are not being forbidden from any ritual involving the cow or otherwise. When you are able to live in exactly the same way as you would if others did not eat beef, how are they being intolerant?One analogy I can think of would be alcohol/pork. These items are forbidden for Muslims. Should they be banned by law, or should non-Muslims give up these items voluntarily to not offend Muslims? Or think interfaith marriages. According to Islamic law, Muslims are not allowed to marry Hindus. Most traditional Muslims would fume at the thought of a Muslim marrying a Hindu - it really offends them. Should interfaith marriages be banned because of this? Should Hindus break off relationships with their Muslim girlfriends/boyfriends? Definitely not. The individuals involved in the activity have nothing to do with the people getting offended. And those getting offended are not being forced to drink alcohol, eat pork or marry outside their religion.My personal request to you would be to open your mind. Cows are not purely religious items. They are material things, and they mean different things to different people. This is not like the abstract concept of a God. If a Muslim or a Christian insults Shiva, you can say that they are being intolerant and doing this to offend you - Shiva does not exist outside the framework of Hinduism. On the other hand, when they eat beef, they are not doing this to offend your religious sentiments - they are only eating what they consider food.Finally, how can non-Hindus expect tolerance from Hindus when they are not tolerant themselves?The answer is that non-Hindus expect nothing of that sort from Hindus. I expect that you will let me follow my religious and cultural activities, and my personal habits - and I will let you follow all yours. I do not expect you to change a thing in your life for me. I understand that our ways of life are different, and things I hate might be part of your habit and vice versa. I will let you do all those things I consider against my religion as long as you don't force me into them as well. I expect that you will not make me change my personal life just because it goes against your religion. And I will make sure that I don't force my personal habits which go against your religion on you. I will not steal or disrespect your cow. And when I buy beef from someone who slaughtered a cow they did not consider sacred and cook it, I will make sure that I don't feed it to you. If you demand that all food items containing beef and all materials made using beef carcasses at some point be marked prominently, I will support your demand as well.Isn't that what pluralism and tolerance are all about?"

S' As a group, I don\'t think that Indian Muslims think too much about Ambedkar.He is just known as one of the major figures related to Indian independence but that\'s it. I remember my Usthads mentioning Gandhi and Nehru in my Madrassa, but never Ambedkar.This is due to two reasons:Ambedkar\'s contributions are not given sufficient weight in the school history textbooks or in popular cultureAmbedkar did not directly influence Muslims the way he influenced DalitsAmbedkar was the leader of Dalits, and brought honour and identity to hundreds of millions of them nearly single-handedly. Nearly every Dalit alive today knows how much they owe to this man, and adores him - practically worshipping him. Muslims do not have such a direct relationship with him and do not appreciate him as much, since his contributions to modern India are not covered so much in the textbooks compared to Gandhi or Nehru.Personally, I have immense respect for him - especially with my Muslim identity.My first serious encounter with Ambedkar was when his biography was part of the reading material for one of the quiz competitions in my state. I was too young (13 if I remember correctly) and not so well-read to appreciate his contributions, but I had immediate respect for the man who started off at the lowest level of society and fought everything to become the leader of oppressed millions and the principal architect of the constitution of India. This is what he started from (from his biography on Wikipedia):He used his position in the army to lobby for his children to study at the government school, as they faced resistance owing to their caste. Although able to attend school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or assistance by the teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. Even if they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste would have to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; the situation he later in his writings described as "No peon, No Water". He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he had to take home with him.If I were in his position, I would have given up. I guess that was the whole point. The upper castes systematically excluded the Dalits from education, making it difficult to downright impossible at every level for them to achieve education and social status. To this day we have teachers forcing Dalit children to clean toilets in India. And a century ago, this man was able to fight it out and reach the top.After that competition, I went on with my life and did not think of Ambedkar more than the occasional passages about him in my textbooks - Until I was in college and decided to watch the biopic Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar (love you and miss you, DC++). Admittedly, I watched the movie primarily because Ambedkar was portrayed by Mammootty. That was a very well-made movie and a very moving portrayal of the man and his struggle. I then actively read about him a bit, and was more attracted to him.Even ignoring his humble beginnings, what he did was monumental. Had he not existed, the condition of Dalits and backward communities in India would have been abysmal (not that it is particularly great even today). He is the reason SC/STs have representation in legislature today. His championing of the Dalit Buddhist movement was one reason caste Hindus had to worry and start caring - at least namesake - about Dalits. He once famously said to Gandhi, "Mahatmaji, I have no country". If Dalits feel any less like that today, it is thanks to Ambedkar.Beyond Dalits, his effect on the laws of India is also huge. Being the first law minister and the chairman of the Constitution drafting committee, he had a major role in ensuring that the constitution was the perfect social document for India. It outlawed untouchability and discrimination, and ensured civil liberties and social rights for everyone. I believe that, without a man who had to suffer so much himself at the helm, we would not have had such constitutional guarantees. His drafting of the Hindu code bill was the first serious instance of legislative social reform in independent India.Overall, I respect him a lot. In my eyes, he is the number one architect of modern India. I believe that Indian Muslims need to appreciate him more, for quite a bit of religious freedom we have today is thanks to him. Muslims will be well served by having an Ambedkar among them to achieve social reform and overcome the backwardness the community faces today.'

S' Indian movies rarely criticise religion itself but just certain social aspects of religion which have a negative effect.Think about the recent movies which have caused much outrage : PK, OMG - Oh My God, and Dharam Sankat Mein. These movies do not criticise Hinduism in its entirety but only practices such as godmen and wastage in the name of religion. OMG even has Krishna as a main character. Essentially, these movies only talk about the flaws in the present interpretation and practice of Hinduism but do not question the idea of Hinduism itself. As a result, I have seen even staunch Hindus love these movies and not feel that they say anything bad about Hinduism. There have been better treatments of controversial practices in Hinduism such as Diksha before, and I believe that movies questioning things such as the caste system in Hinduism would be more of a "problem" to Hinduism than these movies. But nobody makes movies about such serious issues.Now coming to your question, Why movies about Hinduism and not Islam?The first reason is that very few movies are made about Muslim society in India in general. Look at the list of highest-grossing Bollywood films. Of the top 25 grossing films, only two (Dhoom 3 and My Name Is Khan) have the main star portraying Muslim characters. I bet that you can do a similar analysis with the list of Bollywood films of 2014 and find that barely 10% of all reasonable-budget films are made centered on the Muslim society (Muslims do get a lot of representation in Bollywood films as antagonists). The "Muslim social" has pretty much died. When only one in ten of films are made about Muslims, isn\'t it only fair that only one in ten of films criticising religion are about Islam?The second reason is that some of the biggest problems with Islam are not pertinent in the Indian context. In the question details, you talk about stoning women in Islam and barbaric sharia laws. Who stones women in India in the name of Islam? Sharia laws considered barbaric are usually criminal laws, and India has the same criminal law for everyone.The third reason is that movies do talk about problems with Islam which matter in India. OMG talked about all religions, and Dharam Sankat Mein talked about the Imam trying to force conversion. Fiza and Shahid were about Muslim youth joining terror groups, and Nikaah was about the issues with the Islamic requirement that a divorcee can remarry his wife only after she has been married and divorced by another man (The Malayalam film Ghoshayaathra was about the same issue). Bazaar was about bride-buying from poor Muslims by expatriates. I am sure that there have been various other movies in other Indian languages about those issues, such as the Malayalam films Paadam Onnu: Oru Vilapam about the problem of early marriages among Muslims in Kerala, Uppu about polygamy, and Alif about women\'s issues. As Pankaj Tripathi points out, movies criticising problems with Islam have been made even in Pakistan.In short, I believe that Indian movies till now have focused on only criticising certain aspects of religion (as supertsitions and "fake religious" practices), at the same time glorifying religion and spirituality instead of questioning them. I would like to see movies questioning religion itself rather than religious practices. I would also like to see more movies about Muslims in India in general, rather than just having them as sidekicks or villains. Movies can be a strong vehicle for social change, and our society will be well served by well-made movies talking about issues with both Hinduism and Islam, such as caste system and oppression of women.PS: I haven\'t been watching movies for quite some time, and I have absolutely no idea of movies from most other Indian languages. It would be great if you can suggest more movies (Hindi or otherwise) about social issues among Muslims, and I will add those to the answer.'

S' In your introductory course, you would have learned about materials with a linear response (linear homogenous isotropic dielectrics are the only things anyone deals with usually). That is, the polarisation induced is proportional to the electric field. The consequence of this is that the light scattered by such objects has the same frequency as the incident light.But in reality, material response is not linear. Many materials have a nonlinear response and the relationship between polarisation and field is more complicated. In many cases, we can express the polarisation as a power series in the electric field. The first term in the series after the linear one is usually quadratic, and it results in scattering at twice the frequency of incident light, which is known as second harmonic generation (SHG).Now, these nonlinear effects are highly dependent on symmetry. For example, in crystals which show centrosymmetry, there can be no second harmonic generation from the bulk of the material but only from the surface. Thus we usually differentiate between bulk SHG and surface SHG.'

S' How about "It is a policy that aims to correct the massive under-representation of SC/ST/OBCs which is a result of long-standing and ongoing discrimination, and requires quite a bit of time to achieve its goals in the Indian society where caste is still strong?"The number of SC/ST/OBCs in India falls in hundreds of millions. The number of educational/employment options affected by reservations is too small to uplift the whole lot of them in such a short amount of time. We are talking about correcting centuries long discrimination in a few decades (actually the full extent of reservation as it stands today is a very recent phenomenon). This is quite impossible in today\'s society where marriages are still caste-based and Dalit children are still forced to clean toilets and even raped and killed for attending school.A lot of policies targeting the massive population of India work like this, requiring a lot of time. We started a universal literacy programme around independence - that has not turned India 100% literate in the past 6 decades, but we are slowly getting there. We also started a family planning programme decades back. We have not yet achieved replacement fertility yet, but we are getting there as well. If you would not use the binary logic and ask for such programmes to be scrapped, why the hurry in ending only reservations?In fact, the reservation policy is showing slow success. Reservation policy has started to improve the lives of SC/STs. They are starting to get adequate representation in the lowest levels of employment. Let it continue for a few more generations so that they can attain vertical mobility and achieve proportional representation in all levels of employment and get to enough positions of power so that discrimination is reduced. When you start a policy to solve a problem, you end it when the problem is solved - not after an arbitrary amount of time.PS: I have written many answers on Quora supporting reservations and addressing common oppositions. They have been compiled here.'

S' This answer is from the perspective of a Muslim man from Kerala, who has just seen women around him. There are multiple answers on the page from Muslim women who wear the Hijab completely out of choice, and explain how that is the general trend. Please read and upvote those answers : Lyn Folks, Nina Sakinah, Cassandra Strand, Zoha KhanChoice is a complicated word.Is a woman wearing a burqa out of choice if she is doing that:Because her religion requires it to?Because that is the social expectation?Because her family asks her to?First of all, there are differences in how exactly Muslim women cover their heads. Some women cover their heads with shawls or ends of their sarees. Some keep pinned headscarves, some others wear the purdah without covering their face. Then there are some who cover their face too, and some who go so far as to cover their eyes with nets. The proportions of who does what varies from region to region, showing that this is not a monolithic Islamic custom but one with serious regional influence. In Kerala, for example, I am yet to see a woman who covers her face. My mother wears a headscarf and saree when she goes to teach in school or for other public functions, but she wears a Purdah without face covering when she goes to the mosque. The wide variety of clothes Muslim women use to cover their head can be seen here : List of types of sartorial hijab.The reasons why Muslim women wear these clothes are equally complicated. At one end of the spectrum, there are women who wear it merely as a cultural symbol - one that identifies them with Islam - without even thinking of it as a religious requirement. At the other end, there are women who are forced to wear it and won\'t be allowed to leave home without it. Majority of the Muslim women fall somewhere in the middle.Most women who wear religious clothing as a religious wear voluntarily also follow the many other compulsory things in Islam. Their adherence to clothing is no different from their praying five times a day or their fasting in Ramadan. Would they have done it if the religion had not asked her to? Surely not. But is that a lack of choice? I believe that it is not, but it is a debatable question. Then we have women for whom wearing Islamic clothing is a social thing. When everyone around you is dressing in a certain fashion, you naturally tend to follow the custom. There is also the point that you are brought up and encouraged to dress that way. Even if there is no compulsion, there is the invisible social pressure, not very different from any other peer pressure. An interesting contrast in the Indian context would be the Saree. It is a much more complicated piece of clothing to wear, and is quite restrictive. Yet, many Indian women wear Sarees every time they leave home. Is it purely out of choice? Would they have continued to wear the Saree if that was absolutely not a social expectation from them? I don\'t think so.Finally we have women who are forced to wear Islamic clothing. Their "choice" is to stay at home or go out in Islamic clothing. This is an absolutely horrible state of affairs, but exists in many parts of the world.Overall, the question of choice is very difficult to answer primarily because it depends on your definition of choice. There are women who are doing it completely voluntarily, and some who are being forced into it.But what I hope you will take away from all this is that every Muslim woman is an individual, and what she wears is the product of her individual circumstances. Do not look at a Muslim woman with prejudice merely because she is wearing Islamic clothing. You can say nothing about how free or empowered she is based on what she wears. And please try not to "force-empower" them by banning Islamic dressing, especially in educational institutions and employment. Education and financial independence are the way to individual freedom, and banning Islamic clothing from these places will just result in many Muslim women leaving these avenues voluntarily or involuntarily.'

And being one of billions, means that we are part of one great moving evolving process in this thing called life. As a Top Writer, I can find ways to be special. I can attach my ego to my little badge given to me by people that I don\'t even know. I can say that I\'ve written a few things that have touched other people. I can say that I\'ve enjoyed writing here and have enjoyed even more getting good feedback and even being published. Writing is my thing. Other things, not so much. But what I cannot say is that this makes me someone that stands out as special, privileged, or better than others. Everyone likes to feel special, and there are all kinds of ways to do that. I can use my Top Writer badge to bolster my self esteem on days that I really need it. When I feel insecure, I can remember a compliment I\'ve gotten and feel a bit better. I\'m sure there is something you can use as well. But that way of relating to oneself always falls short. It\'s nice, but it\'s not enough. It\'s about being special simply because you are alive. Because you are a human being. In this way, I can say that yes, I am special- and as a human being, so are you. You are actually the most important person in the world. You have to be because if you do not believe that, you will not be in the driver\'s seat of your own life, which means you will always allow others and outside situations to define you "as less than." You must believe you are the most important person because if you don\'t, you will not be taking your life seriously- for all the right reasons. Let me explain.Being the most important person means many things. It means that you get to be the creator of your own life. It means that you get to be limitless, that you choose to see yourself that way- regardless of struggles. Above all else, it means that you get to put into motion a life that is meaningful, rich, loving, beautiful and generous. You get to generate something. Not only for yourself- but for others too. This is how you leave your signature on the world. Being a special person to yourself- first and foremost- is what will make you shine like a diamond in this world. Go be your own diamond, friend.'

Those days when things break down- when the toast gets burnt at breakfast, or we spill our coffee on our report.

From there on, it seems it\'s one calamity after another.On days when things don\'t go our way, we can feel like we\'re in a bad movie- like life has its own agenda for us which is to cause things that don\'t normally dysfunction, to do so with full force.It\'s days like those that we might believe we have no access to choice or even free will. Like all of our moves just play out in some big story that we have no dominion over. So what do you do on days like this? When you think there is no hope for turning it around?Look at the sun. Look at the moon. Look at a friend. Gaze at a body of water. Look at the leaves blowing. Search for the face of an animal. Anything natural will do. Just look at it, intently, for a while. Let its energy carry you away a little. Let it wash over you with something warm, something simple, something that feels right. And as you look at this lovely thing, this piece of nature, let your mind be still for once today, on this day where nothing seems to be going the right way. Just still it as you meditate upon this piece of nature, this work of art that is your friend, or that sun- whatever. And then tell yourself these words, "It stops here because I say so." And to seal the deal, look some more- until you are ready to start your new day. No matter how bad things seem, it doesn\'t get to be bad unless we allow it to. There is always more room for an attitude of positivity- a position of lightness (not denial) -even on the worst days. '

American steak is too thick and heavy. Hamburgers included.3. The portions are laughably much too big. One big American helping would serve about 4 people in Japan as a share.4. American desserts are ridiculously sweet and barely edible.5. There is too much fat in Western food in general. Japanese people are generally not big fans of cheese, so anything with cheese or cream in it becomes automatically an issue.6. American coffee is too watery.7. English and German food is not well liked by Japanese which includes heavy baked dishes, french fries, and baked beans. 8. Our salad dressings are pretty nasty for Japanese tastebuds. Particularly the creamy ones.9. Western style sushi is totally off and not the same as Japanese sushi. We don\'t get the rice right.10. The flavors we choose for potato chips are completely different than what Japanese choose. For example, salt and vinegar versus soy sauce and butter flavor. 11. American chocolate is too sweet.

You do not wake up in the middle of the night sweating over causing another person's pain. You do not feel that knot in your stomach because you were a jerk yesterday and hurt your mother, or your brother, or you friends, or your lover. You get to feel relaxed around your very own instincts over time, because you begin to trust your own deepest motives. You know that if anyone in your life dies today, your last interaction with them was clean, loving, and kind. You know that if you die today, that all of your interactions are exactly what you wanted them to be. You are not unnecessarily torturing someone, withholding, or leaving them with guilt or shame.

Some people who say they don't believe in anything supernatural, paranormal, or even spiritual, are actually terrified of anything that is not logical or rationally based. Most people are easily spooked and that sensation does not come from the logical part of the brain. A friend of mine, Gerard Senehi, used to do shows for people that would scare the hell out of them. He moved objects without touching them, bent spoons by just twirling them, and levitated cigarettes and other objects. He was good. Really good at this.I was at several of his shows and he would literally scare people some people to death. His shows defied all reason and logical thinking. They were filled to the brim of acts that would make the hair on your arm stand up. And some of his so-called tricks were so elaborate, no one could figure out how he did it without having some kind of special powers.I witnessed people actually get angry during his show and run out the door.

He put everything he had behind doing what everyone thought was an impossible act- to walk.

Thus, a blind man decides to climb Mt. Everest- and he does it. A man with no legs decides to ride across Ghana- and he does it. A fat person decides to walk across the United States- and she does it.

Americans may be more prone to wanting to find out because our country is so young, and because our lineages are much vaster than we ever thought. Knowing what nationalities you belong to is a right. This isn't easy for certain races such as African Americans, who may never trace back their heritage because their lines have been cut by forced migration and slavery. Luckily with DNA testing, there is hope. And now many more people are able to know not only where they came from 200 years ago, but thousands.

S" When my brother and I were little we used to laugh at my mother's hair. She wore it teased really high, like a lot of women in the 1950's and 60's, only she kept it that way all of her life. We used to say that when we were lost in a store, all we had to do was look over the aisle and see mom's hair floating above the shelves. Then we were found.In 2002, I went through one of the hardest points of my life- a divorce. I cannot even begin to convey the devastation I felt after only a few short years of marriage. At the time, I was in so much shock I could barely work. And I had just moved to a new state after living in Japan for 5 years, so I was alone there, scrambling to figure out what new direction my life could possibly take.My mother leapt at the chance to come and visit me. She was afraid of flying so she rode 15 hours on a Greyhound bus through several states to stay with me for a few days. Although her visit was somewhat of a blur, as she was leaving to go back home on the bus, I had a moment of clarity that I will never forget. We hugged and kissed goodbye and she had tears in her eyes like she always did when we parted. All of my life I had left my parents at some bus stop and they stood there faithfully with tears of sadness at my leaving. I was normally the one getting on the bus, but this time it was her leaving me behind. I stood there faithfully, as she boarded the bus, just like she always did for me. I saw her take a seat by the window. We waved goodbye and as I watched the bus go down the street, all I could see was the silhouette of her hair getting smaller and smaller in the distance. Every time I think of that moment, I break down and my heart fills with more love than I know what to do with."

S' Accept reality. Put down your idealizations about a particular person, job, situation, relationship, bow your head and accept that life does not always work out on your terms.Letting go is the same thing as accepting reality. This is why meditation is sometimes simple, sometimes impossible practice. It is hard to let things be when we have a stake in the outcome, when we are attached to our ideals. Sometimes you just have to accept losing people, opportunities, things, money, time, and health. And even as I write this, something rages up inside of me that screams, "NO!!!"'

He/she can inspire you beyond measure, opening up doors of perception, experience and insight that you had never imagined were even there. A good teacher shows the sweet, sweet way to interest, passion, and great potential. A good teacher is someone you can remember for the rest of your life as that connection to a spark. Yes, a good teacher lights you up from within.When done wrong, a teacher can ruin your life by discouraging you deeply. You may want to give up on yourself, your talents, and the subjects that you were once interested in. A bad teacher rips you off, tears down your enthusiasm, and cuts off your oxygen like a paper bag over your head. A bad teacher stays with you for life.

S" In a country where culture is oriented towards group harmony, group ethics, and a specific hierarchy is strongly adhered to, individuality and independence is very difficult to find and foster. In fact, I would argue that Japanese culture has trouble with asserting individuality and independence. As a teacher in Japan, I had a very difficult time eliciting individualistic responses in conversation. If one person gave me an answer in a conversation group, often the entire group would parrot that answer too. Independence involves disagreement- and you are hard pressed to find that expressed openly in Japanese culture.There is a strong dependence in Japan on its cultural norms, expectations, and adherence to rules and to the hierarchy. It is not just suggested, it is expected. Independence is not rewarded. If you look at women, for example, you will find many who will reach a certain age and if they are not already married, they will hit that glass ceiling fast if they manage to get a position beyond office worker and making tea for others. Their bosses may begin to ask them when they plan to get married. Their families will begin to hint around that it is time. Not only that, but they may even lose their jobs or be unable to move forward in their work as a way of coercing them towards marriage.If they are married, then they may not be able to access health insurance on their own. They may be forced to be dependent on their husband's health insurance or unable to work full time hours.No, independence is not encouraged in Japan.Take salary men.They are often at the beck and call of their company which has the right to tell them to move to another city- like it or not- even if it means living away from their families. They are socialized to live in company dormitories where their meals are made for them and everything is done for them so that they can concentrate on their work. These men work together, live together, eat together, party together and bathe together.Take college students.They are often given very little choice in what they will choose to major in and study. Their professors often decide which company is right for them and will advocate for them to get hired. Many people do the choosing for them, it is often not characteristic for them to decide their career path, or they may have very limited options.On another level, take the United States' presence in Japan.Turn on the radio in Yokohama and you will hear American military radio stations blaring memoirs of wars gone by. Hyped up American war hero stories are reenacted by obnoxious 1940's sounding American radio hosts- broadcasting American triumphs in particular battles. This was one of the most shocking and uncomfortable things I have ever heard overseas. Japanese have been trying to shake free and independent from the American military presence in Japan for decades. So, for the record, there is a profound lack of independence in Japanese culture and this creates tremendous pressure for people of all ages."

S' It was a book I was compelled to underline, thoughtfully, and yet I wept over its pages for 5 straight years. I read it every March. It was more than a book to me but a witnessing of both the depths of the worst human behavior imaginable delivered by the gentlest, most poetic voice I had ever read. The book that changed my life was Night by Elie Wiesel.As a young woman, I first learned of Elie Wiesel when he delivered a keynote speech at a family therapist conference I was going to. The speech was on "morality in psychotherapy." "Who is this?" I asked one of my friends. And she told me, "That is Elie Wiesel. Have you ever read Night?"I had not. So my friend suggested I pick up the book and read it from start to finish. "It won\'t take you long," she said, but she was wrong. I savored it and let it penetrate me for days with its horrors. The first sentence that I underlined grabbed me. I had been more or less attracted to such life positive books, stories to do with championing over the human spirit. Mild spirituality. Self-help. But this introduction went like this:How can we explain the hate that burns in so many homes?It was a topic I was familiar with. Hatred. Even though I was reading this from a candlelit room 5 decades past the life of this story, hatred still persisted and persists. And so, I was compelled from the moment I picked it up by the narrative, the honesty in that voice of an old man remembering what it was like to be 15 at Auschwitz. I was grabbed by the throat as a young Wiesel lost more than his entire family, but would be forever changed by being a survivor, compelled to remember- for the sake of everyone and for history -what it was like to see God die in the form of a young boy hanging on the Gallows, along with all the people who perished, needlessly, inhumanely, decidedly, and with such organized precision.This story spoke to the depths of my soul. I became aware that it was not just a good book that people should read- but a witnessing that I felt every human being should grapple with if we are to create a new humanity without war, without holocaust, without degradation. To me, this story epitomized all that goes wrong with superiority and a false sense of utopian values. It crystallized so much of who I became in my twenties- and it raised me up- fearfully, yet thoughtfully. As a poet myself, I lost touch with my own sense of poetry after reading "Night". I could not top it. I could not fathom anything more powerful. Reading it was like entering a poem that transformed me as I gasped at the actions of my own fellow human beings and as I witnessed God Himself die in the eyes of thousands. Night made me believe in evil and know that it can exist again inside me, or you, or anyone. It bore witness to the lowest form of human behavior. But it also changed me for the better. Because in that suffering that was witnessed, I let it transform me into a heartbroken human being. This, I felt was an important effect of reading Night. I came to believe that if I could not be heartbroken by this story, then, wouldn\'t history surely repeat itself? And so, as one of the famous quotes in the story reaches me and so so many people who read it, I was surprised and glad to see it encrypted on the walls of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. And as the melody of this quote lives deeply in myself and all who read it, may we never forget either.Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little face of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my Faith forever. Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to life as long as God Himself. Never.'

S' It doesn\'t matter whether you are fixated on the past, present, or future. What matters is your relationship to your thoughts. One of the functions of ego is a really nasty drone inside of ourselves that basically says, "Something is wrong. Something is missing. Something stinks." It is a faint voice that continually drones on and on. Some people, when they get into a meditative practice can begin to hear that voice and objectify it. This is part of the purpose of meditation- to objectify and get some perspective on the crazy thoughts, and emerging feelings that seemingly well up out of the blue.Once you recognize that you are not those crazy thoughts, that ego, there is room for more liberation inside of you. There is space to breath and in that, the objectification of those thoughts- such as referring to the past- will begin to diminish in importance.This is really the big lesson: you want to diminish the importance of those thoughts, not necessarily get rid of them (which may not be possible anyway). So the goal is not to just live in the present- it\'s to develop a positive relationship to your thoughts, whether they are negative in nature or not. To be untouched by them, really, and not to be victimized by them. That\'s power. And that is so so possible to those who truly want to develop a healthy relationship to thought.'

S' If you think about it, it is not necessary to love oneself in order to be in love. Many people claim to be in love if you consider how many things this means. We do not have to love ourselves in order to feel the desire to be rescued from loneliness, for example. We do not have respect ourselves in order to experience sexual attraction. We do not have to treat ourselves well in order dream about a perfect world with another.But if you asked the question, "Is it possible for us to fully partner, care for, love, and commit to another human being if one does not love oneself," my answer would be, "no."There is a huge difference between the feeling of being in love and what it means to be truly loving. Being in love serves the function in bringing two people together and forming a bond. As powerful as it feels and even as all encompassing as it is, being in love, the state of it, is really not that deep. It is not attached to morality. It isn\'t associated with being a good partner, a peaceful person. This is why it is so easy for people to fall in love but much much more difficult to stay connected and committed. And so, loving oneself or even hating oneself is irrelevant- because it has nothing to do with a self possessed, conscious form of behaving morally, truthfully, faithfully, or bestowing goodness upon your beloved.On the other hand, truly staying loving, committed, and acting in the best possible way on behalf of your beloved, requires great love for oneself. When we love ourselves, when we respect ourselves, and when we care about how to conduct ourselves as fully loving people, we must know firsthand what that means, and above all else, value it. Even if we are full of unconscious holes, or conditioning, or have had pain inflicted upon us, we must have some basis for knowing what loving behavior is and therefore, have some kind of connection to it. So many people seem to have that foundation but have not yet learned how to fully love themselves throughout all circumstances, and so there are gaps in what we value and how we react and behave.So on one hand, we must have that core in order to be fully loving, and on the other, rarely does an individual have a complete sense of self-love - in the healthiest and highest sense of the word. In essence, we are all a work in progress on the continuum of becoming self loving and loving others.'

S' That which you are seeking is causing you to seek.There are many paths to the inner world and you are already on one by asking this question. How can you be separate from spirit or your own true self, and not know about it? In many cultures which focus on materialism, we have never been taught how to develop spiritually. The fact that you are interested in finding out how to develop spiritually means that you are ready to consciously develop spiritually. Your consciousness has expanded to include spiritual development which is very different from other forms of development such as cognitive, emotional, physical, or financial development. Spiritual development is specifically, something else entirely.So you develop spiritually by continuing to put attention onto your questions, your inquiry. Seek after what pulls you forward. Contemplate what you think about spiritual development. Look at what others have to say about it- read, try a practice that you are drawn to- whatever speaks to you, draws you in, interests you above all else, man, do it.'

S' Here are some practices and habits that have had an impact on my life:1. Asking myself, "What do you want to create?" before going to an important meeting, event, or date. This habit is really life changing and puts you in the director\'s chair in life. It allows you to stop and think about the purpose of participating in that event, with those particular people, and creates an urgency to think about the reason for it. In this way, you are creating something in life, rather than being a passive participant. Many times I asked myself this before a date, for example, and came to the conclusion that I merely just wanted to create something positive. That always happened, even if the date was not someone I would get involved with.2. Going on a retreat at least once a year. This could be any number of things- a meditation retreat, a business conference, a training that you\'ve always wanted- or just a relaxing time away. Making it a habit to go on a retreat at certain times of the year will definitely give you the chance to re-charge your batteries, and above all- decompress. It\'s a precious time to get away and let go of the world and everything in it. You come back to the world refreshed and renewed- ready to see your life and your role in it with completely new eyes.3. Having a dream. This requires you to really be awe-struck with the world and to never get to the place of having, doing or knowing it all. The dream is something you want to accomplish, do, or achieve. It should be hard to come by and not ordinary. Running a marathon, buying an expensive car, doing volunteer work in a 3rd world country, taking a tour of the world, walking the Camino de Santiago- these are difficult to achieve and therefore, dream material. Having a dream gives you something extraordinary to live for- gets you out of your mundane schedule and allows you to be a little more interesting. Even if you never know when you can accomplish it, having a dream gives you something exciting to strive for- and an appreciation for that which is extraordinary in life.4. Talking to and making friends with someone wise who is much older than yourself. This habit is life-changing because it directly puts you in touch with the wisdom of another era, how things have been done, what has been learned over time, the history you\'ve never known, and a kind of depth that is not easy to find in everyday life from people your age. I have a friend who is 95 whom I made my first film about. After months of working together on his film, I became so enamoured with him and his perspective. I loved hearing his stories detailing all the eras that came before me, It is worth knowing someone who has walked this planet far earlier than you. If you are open to this, you will hear and learn things that will change your perspective on everything- and it will give you a friend that can give you something so unusual and special. 5. Capturing everything you\'ve done, achieved, created- every year in writing on or around your birthday. Before writing on Quora, I used to be an avid journal writer. Now, I limit my journal writing to once a year- on my birthday. I go to a quiet place, usually near the ocean or in the woods, bring my journal- and write for pages on everything that I\'ve done that year. Usually I include my personal journey, victories I\'ve had, professional leaps, where I started the year and how I ended it. It\'s a once a year habit that is so well worth it because you can record the highlights, challenges, and victories of your life without needing to commit to an everyday journal practice. It also allows you to see how far you\'ve come over time, and the arc of your life which can develop year by year. These practices and habits have made me a more conscious individual. They are all powerful in their own way. I highly recommend them as an enhanced and conscientious life practice.'

S' If there is any confusion around whether Japanese people love golf, look no further. They do. They really do. And while many of my Japanese students would cite "golf" as one of their hobbies, the golf craze in Japan means much more than your general stamp collecting way to pass the time.Golf in Japan is a form of status. To have a golf membership at one of the countries\' 2500 courses (the highest number of all Asian countries put together) is a form of financial success and social status.In my brief married life, my Japanese family actually took me to their golf resort which included a posh onsen, hotel and spa. It was more than golf. It was a spendid vacation and we were pampered to the nth degree. Having grown up with golf in my family (my father was caddy master at the local golf course down the street from my high school), I myself grew up on the golf courses in Indiana. No big woop. It was kinda fun. Not my thing. Boring, yet serene. I liked riding the golf carts.But my Japanese family. Whoa. Where my father paid less than a couple of Lincolns in the 80\'s to play golf down the road, my father-in-law boasted a $100,000 membership at his resort. I taught hundreds of Japanese people and based on more than dozens of conversations, the topic of golf came up frequently. In fact, I used to debate with my male students (in particular) as to why golf was so riveting to them as I have always found it boring.What I heard, time and time again, was first the expense of playing golf in Japan. It cost (as of the late 90\'s) around $300 to even get on a golf course. This is exponentially higher than in other countries. Check out this article in the New York Times written in the 80\'s. Want to Play Golf in Japan? Got a Million?So the reason why golf is so popular in Japan, is, prestige. Apparently you get to be somebody in a country where everyone is supposed to blend together.'

S' The fact that you\'re this confused, insecure, and uncertain and that this guy has got you into such a tail-spin about who you even are, suggests that you probably have some important inner and personal work to do. Leave him out of it. As you say, he\'s got his issues and is probably far from being ready for a mutually loving relationship. But he came along for a reason- and you jumped on this bandwagon and even considered marriage with someone who became abusive to you and pointed you directly to your own insecurities. I hope that terrifies you more than whether you did the right thing by leaving him. I hope you are more concerned about your own well-being, sanity, and future, than his.Along with Sanjay\'s suggestion, I suggest you look into some very important work that is being done by Melanie Tonia Evans on abuse, narcissism, and co-dependency. Her program is unique, deep, and thoroughly effective. It is illuminating stuff. The reason you attracted this kind of person into your life is indicative of your own blind spots. In Melanie\'s work, she speaks about the need to learn how to "self-partner"- which has to do with becoming clear about your subconscious wounds from the past (yes, I know it sounds like psycho-babbble, but hang in there with me), uplevel them, heal them, and re-wire yourself. The goal is to be conscious of your triggers, and to move out of victimization to thriver mentality so that you can attract loving people into your life, rather than abusers. She has developed her own recovery program and many free videos, articles, and webinars you can check out on the web. Until you get to the root of why you are attracted to such complicated men, you will continue to find relationships confusing, perplexing, and full of pain. What I\'ve learned is that these kind of relationships are not random events. We attract people that treat us like we treat ourselves. When we hold ourselves responsible for other peoples\' problems, we are co-dependent. We have lost the plot. We have given up our sense of wholeness. So stop the doubting, and all the confusion. You did the right thing. Now the choice is yours to go deeper, or continue on that same track- into the arms of potentially another difficult and painful relationship. I wish you well!'

S" I don't think it's normal to be oriented only toward suffering or pain as a goal, and yet, I agree that suffering is a necessary part of life in order to grow and evolve.Evolution takes struggle, it does not come without some form of pain, whether it be stretching to move forward, working hard, or picking oneself up after a personal devastation.Happiness serves a purpose too. It is just as important as suffering. Where suffering is the temperature gauge that tells you when something is really off about a situation, people, or attitude in oneself- happiness is the full tank of gas that allows for life to flow lovingly along. Happiness is a state of being. It is a birthright. It doesn't just come along superficially. Happiness also, demands respect. It is the state in which life and the cosmos comes alive. It is a beautiful state, and it reminds us of the preciousness of life and how truly good life can be.So respect your pain and your happiness.

The state of being is intrinsic to being free enough to face who you are on a deep level. It allows for truth and authenticity to be felt and known. The more you can let go of the ego's false impressions that masks our true selves, the more freedom is felt. In this way, happiness is not a passing feeling that is based on lucky circumstances, it becomes who we are the more we go into who we are- both psychologically and spiritually.Know yourself, face yourself, and then you can be free to know nothing.

S" While it may be educational to be around someone who knows a lot of information, history, or knowledge in general, it can paradoxically also be very dull.A know it all is dull when he interjects his knowledge (as he knows it) into a conversation or situation that does not necessarily welcome it. It can be tedious to listen to, rather than enlightening, spacious, or fascinating. There is a quality that leaves an unwanted impression, as opposed to the smart person who speaks and shares the right thing at the right time.What is dull? The loss of presence to those around him coupled with a lack of room for creating conversation in a mutually satisfying way. In essence, when we know too much and don't give a damn how it affects others, we become out of sync, out of harmony. And the possibility of embracing the unknown dries up.

As long as there is even 1% possibility of free will to make choice, you have access to the power of directionality, of evolution.

The more in harmony with the truth you become of who you are, the more happiness can emerge because you fall deeply in touch with your own true self.

But one would hope he/she could share most anything.In this way, a couple will become closer and more intimate over time and though they may not know everything about each other, they won't be intentionally holding on to certain aspects of their lives that they are unwilling to share."

S' First, let\'s establish this point: Japan ranks among the top ten countries with the highest suicide rate. It is the leading cause of death for men between 22-44. On average, 70 suicides happen every day in Japan, most of them are men. Suicide is definitely a prominent theme in Japan, it is a go-to solution when all else seems to fail. It includes the value of self-sacrifice, which is a highly Japanese value in a society that emphasizes group harmony and cooperation over individuality.The main reasons in recent years for suicide have to do with younger men not being able to find work, lay-offs or firings, and general economic issues. This is quite curious in a country which is considered the 3rd wealthiest in the world. While businessmen have routinely thrown themselves under trains, or gone off to the forest to die, they have also been found dead in twos or threes- hanging in hotel rooms. Figuring that they are worth more dead than alive, salarymen cut the cord of their own lives and simultaneously throw a rope out to their families who will prosper from insurance money once they are gone.It is the responsible thing to do.The culture of self-sacrifice runs deep. There is professional suicide as well- CEO\'s who step down because of the failing or mishandling of the company. Soccer coaches who lose an important game fire themselves and end their own careers. This form of "person removal" is found all over the culture and a consistent story on national TV.It is the honorable thing to do when mistakes are made.This value of self-sacrifice was best exemplified during World War II. And while this is such a strange and chilling action for the westerner to understand, it certainly is not for the fundamentalist who will literally die for their cause, religion, or family.For those of us in the west, we may ask ourselves whether there is anything so extreme worth dying for -outside of a war. It is a theme that is so engrossing because our take on "failure" is just not that important. Failure is a form of success, or at least, can lead up to it. In fact, we barely believe in it. All of our heroes and heroines have failed. They got up and tried again. This is completely opposite of the Japanese.However, there is a new worry in recent decades in Japan. Suicide among depressed and socially isolated people has been changing the intention behind suicide in Japan. These are different reasons for suicide which have more to do with the psychological welfare of the individual- not to do with the group.This is the suicide that, perhaps, will begin to change the mind of Japanese culture: the young person who refuses to become part of society, the young person who is under too much pressure to perform at school, the ones who do not feel loved by their parents. This form is newer. It is not self-sacrifice but giving up, being fed up, and feeling so hopeless about the future.As one of my young woman ESL students wrote me in a letter, By the way, I sometimes feel I am pretty unimportant and my life isn\'t worth living. I\'m not getting along well with my family. I didn\'t think I loved my family. But it\'s not right. I may not be loved by anyone in my family. Because they aren\'t interested in what I do.... Could you tell me how to deal with this problem?We had established that I was a counselor in the United States and she and many others immediately latched on to me. They lined up to learn English, and buddied closer as they longed to tell me their troubles. Certainly it is no secret that the lack of counseling and psychiatric help in Japan is widely problematic. So, I do believe while the standard reasons for self-sacrifice will continue to be part of Japanese culture - keeping it an acceptable form of death- the culture may not be as condoning of suicide in the form of personal and societal unhappiness, despair, and depression in such young people. What they will do about it remains to be seen.'

Maybe there are just hoards of us that are really sorry about this. It's not just about a lion. It's a loaded event. It's white privilege in the form of a U.S. dentist who goes to another continent to live out his dream of slaying a lion. It's about the indecency and brutality of the human who cares more about his own ego than about what is true, beautiful, and awe-inspiring.It is about the anguish in hearing how an innocent animal was coerced by such an evil intention, and how the human brain manipulated an animal in his own habitat for the purpose of hunting it down and killing it.It is about the inhumanity of those who participated in injuring Cecil and then finally killing him, burning him, decapitating him... is this enough? Do you get why so many people are dying over this?The only good thing that comes from this story is that bandwagon of millions of people who feel this pain, who shudder at the site of Cecil's beautiful form when they see his videos, who have felt sick about this atrocity. Apparently, this story cuts close to the bone for many people. It's a lion. A beautiful animal who had a story. Most humans have respect and awe for such an animal.Human atrocities are also real and up front in the media. Caring about Cecil's death does not negate caring about other serious topics of the day. It just hurts, is all."

S' I was walking around at my lunch hour in Boston feeling kind of depressed, feeling like I needed some uplift- someone who could set me straight, give me something to think about, raise my spirits. I took out my cell and began imagining that maybe, I could talk to anyone in the world at that moment. I asked myself the question, "if you could talk to anyone in the world right now, in the history of the world, who would it be?" The answer was Maya Angelou.I pressed the phone to my ear as I walked up and down the streets of Chinatown. Feeling kind of silly, I leaned in and began talking to Maya as if she were on the other end.I felt compelled to listen, somehow, to something- maybe something that would emerge out of the darkness and gradually I hear her voice.She kept saying, "The heart of a woman." "The heart of a woman."I pressed my ear tighter. And then she began to speak. "You think you are on the bottom of the pile," she said, "but you are not. You\'re actually on top, but you just don\'t know it."Gratitude welled up in me right away and my whole perspective flipped on a dime. She continued."I think you should contemplate what it means to be a rich woman. Really think about that," she said with that very familiar Maya sing songy voice at the end of her sentence.Damn, that\'s good, I thought to myself. And I thanked her over and over into my phone. At last she said, "I never spend time with negative people. The minute you do, they start to rub off on you." More gratitude that was real and so deeply felt.I "hung up" the phone and was in a totally different state than where I started. I went back to my office and wrote down the following words:What does it mean to be a rich woman?It has been an excellent contemplation ever since. And the whole experience showed me that our most treasured people are in us already, because they have touched us. We are never alone, in this way. Their voices lie deeply within. In this way, we need never be separated from distance or time. Just pick up the phone.'

S' When you really are meditating, you are in a timeless state. That is why many people who are deeply resting in a meditative place can sit for potentially hours and not know it.Because time is non-existent in the deepest place of letting go, there is no attachment or bondage to the minutes and hours. That is how many who have gone off the grid to meditate somewhere for years on end are able to do this. It is a powerful place.If you are sleeping, that is something different. You also lose a sense of time when you are asleep, but it is important not to confuse this with the meditative state. Sleeping is not the same as meditating even though you can lose all trace of time in both.If you are sleeping, you may just want to try a shorter meditation and see if you can stay alert and awake for the whole time. Also, try to set a soft bell or alarm at the end of your meditation so you do not fall asleep and go over the hour. There are some great apps (such as Insight Timer)that can provide singing bowls and they make great alarms at the end of the session.'

S' This is funny! I consulted my brilliant team of Master\'s level English language teachers and there was some disagreement and some hard feelings. Basically when you use the present perfect tense it brings the past into the present. It has a subtle feeling of doing this. And basically when you use the past, it has a feeling of being, well, just in the past.In this example, however, there is no difference and both are grammatically correct. The word "before" is what equalizes these two sentence structures.'

S' She was compared to Billy Holiday and Dinah Washington and had she not died at 27, she could\'ve been as big as they were in the history of jazz. In fact, said Tony Bennett, she had the ability of a 65-year-old jazz singer who knows all the lines inside and out. Her gifts far exceeded her years, which burned out way, way too early, leaving less than a decade of music behind. She was a prodigy and her voice came from another era. If you were to ever believe in reincarnation, now was the time.Amy, directed by Asif Kapadia, is a two hour documentary which takes its time unveiling the girl behind the eyes. Her personal story is one of a shy girl with a gift for singing and writing poetry. She is pained from her parents\' rocky marriage, when at age 9, her personality changes tremendously like the gradual piercings and tattoos that cover much of her body. As the eyeshadow curves and the hair piles higher and higher, her celebritydom emerges like the most unusual lyrics in her songs. It all happens fast. And when she delivers the poetry, it is through a body and soul which sends each melismatic syllable into you, like a shot right into your bloodstream. Just for the clips of Amy\'s performances alone, this film is worth every penny.The least interesting part of the film is her obsession with Blake, who at first leaves her for his ex-girlfriend, and then later comes back to marry her. He introduces her to heroin and crack and all things poisonous and their co-dependent relationship feeds a kind of brokenness in her as their wounds meet. Many of her songs are about Blake, including one of her biggest hits "Back to Black." The lyrics shock like ECT. He left no time to regretKept his dick wetWith his same old safe betMe and my head highAnd my tears dryGet on without my guyYou went back to what you knewSo far removed from all that we went throughAnd I tread a troubled trackMy odds are stackedI\'ll go back to blackhttps://youtu.be/UbI--2ATHc4The film depicts perfectly Amy Winehouse as a mix of powerhouse creativity and prodigal talent along with that broken doll psychology that continues to emerge right alongside her most beautiful creations. It is a story about how an already fragile personality falls for the wrong person and, what he doesn\'t steal from her soul, the world, as it grows predatory toward Amy, closes in like sharks around her. She is another victim of paparazzi terrorism and invasion. For someone on the brink, as many other artists have been before her, fame truly does "make her go mad" as she hauntingly predicts it would as a young girl. And so, we watch the demise of Amy Winehouse in the perfect tragedy of perfection torn down like the petals of a flower. She is deflowered by the inability to get help for her bulemia and severe alcoholism as her own father continues to push her onto the stage- no matter how sick she is. The most promising and perhaps beautiful moment in the film is her reaction to winning a Grammy as it is announced by her idol, Tony Bennett. Her face, as she watches Tony read her name, is shockingly innocent. You feel this real moment with her as her eyes show the love she has for jazz, and the awe and disbelief that she is truly in that league. https://youtu.be/1CSX8DxYUJkLater, when she is invited to record "Body and Soul" with Tony Bennett, her insecurities come out as she stumbles through a wobbly duet with him. It is truly the pinnacle of her career, and sadly, the last recording she ever makes before alcoholism takes her life a few short months later. If there were ever a reason to see a tragedy such as Amy, it is for this recording with Tony on "Body and Soul." Just as the world became infatuated with her, we witness again, the shameful primitive invasion around such fame (shame on Jay Leno for turning on her). But graciously, we are given one last chance to spend some time in Amy\'s world- two hours to be exact- witnessing what could have been the most famous singer of our time, had she lived a little longer.'

S' My advice is do it. Take the position in Thailand if that suits you better.As someone who has also chosen the helping professions over making money, as well as living abroad in different places- you cannot change your own mind if this is the path that makes the most sense to you.I did it this way and even dedicated a decade of my life to experimenting in a spiritual community that I wholeheartedly believed in. My aspirations have always been lofty and, perhaps, over the top. To be sure, they have never been mundane.But as I stand on my 47th birthday today, I will tell you, there is a price to pay for this nomadic life. If you want to live freely and help people around the world, great, but don\'t deny the practical aspects of needing to build something for yourself on the material plane.Money, while it is not everything, is something. If you spend all of your money and time as a young person and do not put anything away for yourself, you will need to catch up like hell when you get to be my age. That is what I\'m doing now, and it\'s definitely put a kink in my "live and let live" lifestyle. I do not regret any of the decisions I made and the ways I spent my time and money as young adult. But some day, you will need to take stock of what you have built and may find yourself looking around at friends who all have done the "mundane" thing- and they have much more built than you do.Nothing can replace the experiences you have in your lifetime.

S' As Mikhail Kotykhov noted, there are two stages of practicing pronunciation: tjhe "mechanical" way where you produce the sounds in isolation, and "dynamic" way where you use those sounds as a part of the language. My advice is to do both. The more difficult the sound is and the more different it is from your native language, the more energy you must pay on to handle with it. If the sound is physically alien to you (such as implosives or clicks), you need to make yourself familiar with the technique. You need to start with repeating the sound with one word or even in isolation in order to try how it feels to you physically (and of course mentally too). If you just try to use it immediately in floating speech, you may not be able to catch the sound because then you don\'t have time to focus on it.It is also important to note that sounds in languages are based on opposition. A sound is meaningful because it is not another sound. If the language you are learning has more detailed oppositions than your native language, you need to check that you can distinguish the sounds from each other and to produce them distinctly yourself. For example, when contrasting with my language, English has two "a sounds", both which I would without practicing judge to be the same. In American English, the vowels in sock and suck are pretty close to each other, at least if you ask me. If you are not familiar with this distinction, it is important to practice that kind of words in order to make the distinction clear.As Mikhail wrote, the technical practice alone is not enough. When people are drunk, they often speak more dialectically or with a stronger foreign accent than they sober do. That\'s because they then have less control over their language producing. It is the same thing when you speak a foreign language in a real-life situation where you are under stress and unable to pay attention to individual sounds. For instance, I can pronounce English both with General American and Standard Southern British English accents. However, if I\'m using English in a situation where there is a lot of disturbance, I easily mix those accents and perhaps get some inference from my native language. That\'s why you need usage practice to make your sound system automatic. A good way to master the pronunciation of floating speech is to read texts aloud. In that situation, you don\'t need to concentrate on the meaning, grammar or communicational things. You can just think of the pronunciation. This is like the middle ground between the isolation practice and the conversational practice. When you notice that you have problems with some sounds or patterns in conversational speech, you can go back to texts and "locate" the problem and practice it more without disturbance. You can observe, sounds, group of sounds, stress, rhythm and intonation, which you should also be able to apply for the actual language usage. Then you can and should go to real-life situations to use what you\'ve learnt.'

S" In the Microsoft/Nokia product, it is the plural partitive of the Finnish word lumi, which means 'snow'. The plural partitive has the meaning of 'snows', where the amount of snow is indefinite. However, snow is an uncountable word so the plural doesn't make sense in most contexts. If we consider of the usage of this form in Finnish, we could look at a yard with several piles of snow, and say for example that lumia ei ole viel viety pois meaning literally that 'snows have not yet been taken away'. The negativeness requires the word snow to be in partitive. In a positive clause it would be in plural nominative (lumet on jo viety pois = 'snows have already been taken away'). Mostly we use singular just like English when speaking of snow. For example, sataa lunta ('it snows', lit. 'rains snow'), not sataa lumia. The plural partitive form lumia is mostly used in a proverb menneen talven lumia, meaning literally 'snows of the past winter', which means that something belongs to the past and should not be thought of any longer."

S' It is of course good to learn English at school, but it indeed is a problem that it is seen as the foreign language. Because English is seen and heard a lot in media (for example in Nordic countries, English on TV is not dubbed but subtitled) and people can manage their holiday trips abroad by using just English, they believe it is the only language that matters. That\'s why parents choose only English as the foreign language for their children at school, which leads to the situation where smaller schools have to stop offering other languages because of the decreased number of interested students. The dominance of English also leads to some kind of bias of how people see languages. If you ask for example Finnish people, both school children and adults, which is the easiest language and which is the hardest one, you\'ll get English for the first question and always something else for the latter one. People find English easy because of its constant presence. Because of that, people tend to think that the easiness of English is due to its grammar. I learned German for many years at school and many students complained how hard it was. When my teacher demonstrated some German verb form, a student exclaimed that "why everything needs to be conjugated?!", as if conjugating languages were more difficult than word order based languages. (I\'m learning Chinese, too, so I can tell it doesn\'t mean that.) Even Swedish is seen more difficult than English even though it is grammatically simpler than English or German in many aspects. This prevents people from looking into other languages (though, I must say that my country has a lot of language-skilled people in other languages, too). Because everyone here seems to know English well and because TV and internet are full of English, people everywhere else must know English and therefore there is no need seen for other languages. This is the logic I think is really easy to see. Some politicians even want to make English the third official language of Finland.'

S' Dialectology is a linguistic discipline that classifies, describes and documents dialects. It observes regional variation of language. Dialectologists record people\'s speech and find there features that make their form of language an independent dialect. They search the geological distribution of lexical, phonological, morphological and other grammatical features drawing a map of isoglosses. According to the distribution of the features, dialects can be grouped into big and small groups of dialects. Traditional dialectology concentrates on static language. Dialects are seen as stable form of language that can be described with the terms of grammar and lexicon. For instance, Finnish dialectologists (Finnish dialects belong to the most researched dialects in the world, by the way) in the 20th century did their fieldwork by interviewing old people who had lived their all life in the same village without getting a good education. The interviewees were supposed to live specifically in rural areas. Those criteria made sure that the dialect was "pure" and free of intervening influence from other regions or language change. This is why dialectology is not interested in urban language or social factors. Modern sociolinguistics researches the things dialectology is not interested in. It is interested in differences in language that are caused by social factors, which can be regional but related to social classes, gender and rural vs. urban as well. Unlike traditional dialectology, sociolinguistics wants to look into the variation with the same dialect and the same speaker and not to see language as a stable system. Therefore, dialectology is as a strictly limited branch of sociolinguistics, though sociolinguistics is a younger discipline. Dialectology observes only regional variation, whereas sociolinguistics observes every kind of linguistic variation.'

Nordic people in general belong to the culture of negative politeness. That is, people don't address other people if they don't need to. In positive politeness, you have to tell people compliments but in negative politeness, you avoid saying unnecessary things to people who are not in your inner circle. People don't want to intervene in others' businesses. Non-Nordic people may find this rude, but we don't see it in that way. There are cultural places where people behave differently. Sauna has a relaxed atmosphere, which is a good place for foreigners to make contact with Finns if they can't do it elsewhere.

S' It is important to note that budo arts are not primarily self defense, and that self defense is not the same as martial arts. Budo is a modernised way to practice combat techniques safely, without a combat, in a world where we don\'t constantly have to spend time in a battlefield. The old bujutsu () meant the combat methods to harm permanently or to kill an opponent as fast as possible. Bujutsu was developed into bud (), where the aim was not to train warriors but enhance people both physically and mentally. The philosophy turned around: in bujutsu, mental training was a helping method for the combat, whereas in budo, the physical techniques are a helping method for the mental development. When speaking of aikido, we must observe it in the latter sense. Aikido is not meant to be a way to fight in a combat. The name  aikid can be translated as \'the way of meeting with ki\'. For some people ki is a mystical, spiritual thing, but from a physical point of view, it means actually the way how you place yourself in relation to your opponent and how you maintain your stance. Many Japanese aikido senseis don\'t even teach technique almost at all, they just teach aiki, "meeting with the ki" (you are free to see that spiritually or physically (I do the latter one)). In aikido, the practitioners are not in a combat with each other; they are helping each other to observe those aiki things. Both the attacker and the target of the attack have their own important roles in that process. On the other hand, the effectiveness of self defense is more about the way how it is realised than about the art itself. Aikido has basically the same techniques as every martial art. Combat hapkido, which is a self defense and real life focused modern martial art, uses many same techniques as aikido but it uses them in a self defense way. If you practice aikido long enough with the focus on self defense, it is possible that you will learn effective self defense. Though, in that case it may not be aikido any longer that you are practicing. My aikido sensei says that as a self defense, aikido is a long path and you should not choose it if you want to learn effective self defense fast. Fighting just is not the goal of aikido. It is a formalised method of practicing the coordination of body and mind.'

Thus, let's look at the problem from the English point of view./ts/ is pronounced by placing the tongue on the /t/ place and then releasing the airflow with the /s/ manner. Although this specific cluster or affricate is not possible in English, English does have a similar kind of affricate in word like church and cheese. The method of the ch // sound is similar as the one of the ts sound but it happens in a different place. In this sound, the tongue is placed on the /j/ place (as in yes). So, you are first placing your tongue as if you were going to say a palatalised t /t/ as in tube (British English) and then you just release the airflow with the sh // manner. When you realise how you produce the ch sound, you can just move the ch placement to the front. That's how you'll get the ts sound.

For example, if you are familiar with the concept of case-marking, you can easily learn how your target language functions with this feature. In Japanese, you don't need to struggle with all the particles: you can just check that Japanese has marked nominative, topic and accusative and instantly figure out how the system works. Understanding of tense and aspect systems helps almost with every languge: you don't need to get puzzled with Chinese time relations when you understand that it uses just aspects without tenses. Knowing how to analyse sentence structure is the key to the functions of words and forms in a phrase, and it is often useful when reading a complicated text. Distinguishing objects from adverbials is very important, and knowledge of transitivity helps to choose the right form or place for the words in the phrase.In the phonetic side, knowing things like rhythm types, reduction, quantity and lenition is good in the process of making your speech sound right. When you are familiar with the tongue movements and places in your mouth, you can quite easily find the sounds you need in the language.This applies to the structure of languages. It is important to note that achieving the fluent level in a language requires a lot of practical use of the language. Linguistic knowledge can be a very handy tool in that process."

Another essential matter is taisabaki. When you throw, you need to get to the right point so that you are in a good balance all the time. Do basic taisabakis alone. You can also practice the movements of kuzushi just by yourself. Then add some throws to them as tandokurensh ('alone practice'). If you can't do a technique without uke, you can't do it with uke."

S" Six of Finnish eight vowels are arranged as pairs, where one is a back vowel and one a front vowel. The only difference between those vowels is the back-front position of the tongue. In a, your tongue is in the back position. To produce , keep the same low position as in a but push your tongue forward.The same applies for the rounded front vowels as well, which may be difficult for people who don't speak western European languages. To make , keep your lips in the same shape and the tongue in the same height as in o but push your tongue forward. On the other hand, you can think of e pronounced with rounded lips.Similarly, you can think of y as a rounded i or as u produced with the tongue pushed forward."

S" You don't need any physical preparation. Some judo clubs are sport- and competition-orientated, some are more technically-focused. Instructors will tell what kind of additional practice they recommend if any. For example, many judokas practice with an elastic band, but you can't do that in advance because it requires knowledge of the techniques. If you are going to practice traditional judo or judo without competition, there is no need to have certain physical fit. Techniques matter, not your strength (which unfortunately may be otherwise in modern competitive judo).As for equipment, beginners' classes usually allow you to join with normal sport clothing. They will perhaps sell you a judogi very soon. It is also good to have slippers, because it is polite, and in many places compulsory, to wash you feet before training, and slippers enable you to walk to the tatami room without getting your feet dirty again. You can also check the dojo etiquette in advance: bow when you enter and leave the hall as well as when you enter and leave the tatami. Martial arts are individual sports (and traditionally they aren't sports at all) so you should be able to go there as you are without any (physical) pre-training."

Uke starts the techniques by taking a grip or by hitting.Katame no kata shows grappling techniques: holdings, chokes and locks. Uke performs attempts of escape, which tori blocks.Kime no kata is the art of old-fashioned self-defence. It is also called the kata of determination. Uke attacks with bare-hand hits, kicks, grapplings, a knife and a sword. Tori responds with techniques that eventually end with a lock, a stroke or a throw.Kdkan goshin jutsu is the art of modern self-defence. It is supposed to be informal, which is why it does not include kata in its name. Uke attacks with hits, kicks, knife and stick attacks as well as with a gun. Tori responds with appropriate self-defence techniques.J no kata performs soft techniques. Many techniques include uke's attacks followed by a counter move, another attack ending finally to the preparation phase of the throw. Uke is not thrown but he is taken into control so that the throw could be conducted if wanted.Koshiki no kata is based on ancient armour techniques. Uke attacks as if he were wearing an armour and tori responds with a technique that would fall an armoured warrior.Gonosen no kata demonstrates counter throws.Itsutsu no kata has five old techniques, whose performance seems very artistic.Seiryoku zen'y kokumin taiiku is kata which shows atemi-waza.

S' That\'s because every living language is as old. Every language has evolved from earlier proto-languages. Some languages have more innovations than others. Because of that, we call some languages more conservative than their living relatives. This conservatism can\'t be measured outside of the language family. There is no point comparing whether Finnish is more conservative than Icelandic because they belong to different families and therefore there is no reference point. We can say that Icelandic is much more conservative than other Scandinavian languages and that Finnish is more conservative than many Uralic languages but we can\'t compare those conservative features together. If we look at linguistic conservatism in a historical scale, we could say that some modern language can be recognised at a farther time than some other language, because it has retained more features of the proto-language than some other language but this does not mean that this language would be older. It has just changed less. People often refer to writing systems when they speak of "old languages". In reality, the age of the writing system tells only that the nation speaking the language invented the system at certain historical period. It doesn\'t mean that their language would be older than those that have been written for a shorter time. Writing doesn\'t prevent language from evolving either. Even though a language had been written thousands of years, it may have undergone many innovations and thus is less conservative than its relatives, which means that it may have been like a different language at the time it began to be written. This is why we cannot say that Tamil is the oldest language. It has been evolving just like other languages. It is not some fossil from the past. Every languages of these days were spoken in the past, too, but they were in different forms; they were proto-languages. There is no historical points where we could say that "now this Tamil was born" or "now Proto-Germanic has changed into Frisian" or "now Spaniards don\'t speak Vulgar Latin anymore but Spanish instead". Language evolution is gradual and constant. It works similarly in Tamil as well as in other languages. (I was recently asked to answer to a question about the oldest langauge in Europe. I have written more detailed examples about this topic there: Joonas Vakkilainen\'s answer to What is the oldest language in Europe?)'

S" This happens in Finnish, too, but in a very restricted occasion. Singular past participle ends with -nut or -nyt, and in colloquial speech, the final t is not pronounced. However, it doesn't disappear wholly because it assimilates with the following consonant. This results in geminate consonants between the participle and the following word. If the following word begins with a vowel, the final t is represented as a geminate glottal stop.tullut juna [tul:uj:un] ('the train that has come')tullut mies [tul:um:ies] ('the man that has come')tullut pappi [tul:up:p:i] ('the priest that has come')tullut auto [tul:u:uto] ('the car that has come')This also happens with the word nyt ('now') but I can't think of any other words. Other t's are not assimilated with glottal stop, even though they would with some other consonants, at least in my dialect. In standard Finnish, t's are always pronounced as [t]. There are other word types, too, where a lost final consonants assimilates with the following phoneme, creating a long glottal stop before vowels. vene rannalla [ener:n:l:] ('boat on the shore')vene saapui [enes::pui] ('boat arrived')venekin [enek:in] ('boat, too')vene oli [ene:oli] ('boat was')This phonological feature is called boundary gemination (rajageminaatio in Finnish), traditionally also end gemination (loppukahdennus) in Finnish grammar.

S' To put it briefly, children brain has different "settings" from adults. Acquiring a native language requires a sensitive period which happens in early childhood. An infant is able to learn every possible sound used in human language but after the certain period, the sound system gets locked. Everyone learning a foreign language notices how difficult it is to hear or produce particularly the vowel system of a new language. That\'s just the difference between a child and an adult, and that\'s how humar brain works. Children who have been raised by animals with no human contact do not acquire a native language because they have lost the sensitive period (if they are not adopted early enough to a human community). On the other hand, adults who want to learn a foreign language should not take a child as their model of learning. That\'s because, despite the advances of early childhood in language acquiring, children need a long time to become fluent in their language. They need a lot of input from adults as well as they make a lot of mistakes for a long time. Adults are able to learn a language much faster than children. They just need to do it in a different manner.'

S" Aikido teaches certain aspects of martial arts in a more understandable way than judo. The original meaning of shiai in judo was to test one's technique. Nowadays, competitive judo has unfortunately become a strength sport. Aikido helps to see many profound things that have been forgotten in judo, especially among competitive judokas. Taisabaki is an essential part of any martial art. It is one of the most important things if you want to throw somebody. While doing taisabaki, you must keep your hands in front of you all the time without changing the position between your hands and body. If you follow this, throws will be effortless. However, this is not always easily seen in judo because the distance between tori and uke is small. In aikido, the distance is bigger, and it is easier to perceive what a proper taisabaki looks like. Aikido is also an art of ukemi. Judokas are not used to do multifaceted ukemis. They see ukemi just as an inevitable bad thing, which must be done in order to get down safely (and competitors actually don't do ukemi, which is dangerous). Aikido gives diversity to your ukemi and helps you perform as an uke more comfortably. At least it did it to me.Aikido also gives good insight into using the directions and trajectories, which too often are replaced with raw power. One of my judo senseis, who was an olympic judoka earlier, said that first he was a sportsman who needed to train hard in order to be successful. He found judo really difficult and himself very bad at it. Then he got acquainted with other martial arts such as aikido and began thinking teachings himself. He stopped training sport. He did just judo: he practiced kata, taisabaki and stance (like jigohontai). After that, he found judo easy, comfortable, safe, and he also became more successful in competitions than before. Aikido is a good addition to a judoka in the case that the judoka is not a sportsman but a budoka. Competitive judokas are sportsmen and often lack the time or willing to go deep into budo. Those judokas who have time and want to think things profoundly, I recommend to broaden your sight into other budo arts, like aikido."

S' This is probably a cultural thing. The only place, where I\'ve seen the claims of Native American being just immigrants, are Quora questions asked by (presumably) Americans. Even though my school history book told something about the assumed origin of Native Americans, it did not say they wouldn\'t have been indigenous. Interestingly, nations that gained independence from the Russian Empire, or lived near to it, have traditionally called themselves immigrants. Even though Finnish culture and nation were formed in Finland, there have always been questions of "where the Finnish people came", as if they had been a uniform, established Finnish nation somewhere that then just went to Finland. The oldest theory was that Finns were immigrants from Estonia. It is true that the Saami people (who are related to Finns at least linguistically) inhabited the region first and moved then to the North, but still, the ancestors of Finns came in a couple of thousands of years ago. In reality, ancient "Finns" also intermarried with Germanic tribes among others.Hungarians have even a more absurd tradition about their origins. Hungarians are said to have come to Hungary in 896 AD. I\'ve heard that the national museum of Hungary has a painting where a man wearing a funny helmet points forward indicating "Look! There is Hungary!" It is true that the people who later formed the Hungarian nation came to the region of modern Hungary relatively late (which is proven for example by the absence of big dialectical differences), but of course they didn\'t arrive as a single group in a single year. There have also been attempts to prove Hungarians to be linguistic and genetic relatives of Huns, Sumerians and other great cultures, and not of "less noble" Uralic nations. On the other hand, in Japan it would be terrible to claim that the Japanese would be immigrants. New archeological findings suggest that the family of the emperor might have come from Korea, but officials won\'t grant permissions for extended research so that any inconvenient truths wouldn\'t come up. I think this depends on what kind of identity people need. Finns and Hungarians wondered who they were and what was their relationship to their neighbours, and nationalism can also use immigrant theories in order to make desired connections to ancient civilisations. Colonial powers wanted to legitimise their presence in their new homelands. And, nations who have always been independent and have a long culture, don\'t need to think about it at all.'

S" There is already a lot of practical advice for the technique of the trill, but let's focus on phonetics for a moment. It is easier to approach new sounds by linking them to sounds you already know. When people speak of rolled r's, they usually don't differentiate between the actual trill [r] and the flap []. The latter one is already familiar to Americans but it is used differently in the American English phonology from many other languages. In American as well as in some other Englishes, it is an allophone of unstressed intervocalic /t/ and /d/, as in latter and ladder. Because of that, the flap r shouldn't be a problem. People who don't speak American English or any language including the flap, it is better to start with [d]. It has the same place as [r] and []. [] is like a short [d], like a [d] produced by rapidly hitting the alveoli with the tip of the tongue. After mastering this technique, the flap is easy to extend into a trill. The trill [r] is like a series of flaps; like rapid flaps in a row with very short pauses between them. The flaps are of course not produced separately but with the very same airflow. First, locate the alveoli with the tip of your tongue (the [d] place), then start a strong airflow and try to catch the tip of your tongue with it. Then, we should note that languages that are said to have a rolled r, often don't use it as much as said. Scots use mostly the flap, not the real rolled version. In Russian, you can manage very well just with the flap. Actually, palatalised [r] can't be a trill, the only way to pronounce it is to use a single flap (as in ). Finnish r is traditionally classified as a trill, though many Finns (depending on the dialect and idiolect) use just the flap in the short quantity. The long quantity requires a trill but usually two rolls are enough, and some pronounce even the long r as without any trilling. On the contrary, in Spanish you must be able to differentiate between the flap and the trill (pero vs. perro). Furthermore, [r] really is a difficult sound to articulate. Many native speakers of rolled r languages have troubles in it at least in childhood. As a little kid, I replaced [r] with some kind of lateral fricative (I had a so called cheek r). Both of my brothers never learnt it. They use some uvular kind of sounds instead. Even our former president couldn't do it. I even know a guy who pronounces almost nothing in the place of [r]."

S' Louie Popp gave a detailed answer about those languages but the indigenous languages are missing: the Saami languages. The Saami languages spoken in the area of Scandinavia are Pite, Lule, Ume, Southern and Northern Saami. Finnish spoken in Scandinavia can be divided into three parts. Strictly speaking, Finnish refers only to the Finnish-Swedish citizens and newer Finnish immigrants. Those are called svergefinnar in Swedish. Finnic people living in the region along the Torne River speak Torne Valley Finnish, which is also called with their own name Menkieli. It could be just a dialect of Finnish, but Swedish government has granted it a minority language status as an independent language. Furthermore, Menkieli-speaking people are not called sverigefinnar because they are not immigrants or their descendants. There is a similar kind of situation northern Norway as well. The form of Finnish spoken in the county of Finnmark is classified as an independent minority language with the name Kven.Historically, Vrmland in Sweden had its own Finnish dialect called Vrmland Savonian. It was based on the language of eastern Finnish immigrants a few hundred years ago. It is not spoken any longer.'

Though it would be possible to use two phrases with comma if the latter one is an additional phrase. In that case, the additional phrase could just be a regular finite clause:Hn on Skotlannissa, opiskelee siell yliopistossa.(\'He/she is in Scotland, studies there in university.\')The verb \'studying\' (opiskelemassa) is in the 3rd infinite inessive. It is used as a progressive form (e.g. olen juuri nyt opiskelemassa = \'I\'m right now studying\'), but it also works as a locative answering to the question "where is she", where the answer is a verb.

S" The safety level of a martial art depends on how you practice it. Of course there are hard and soft styles, but none of the modern arts should break your body. I practice Judo, too, and I don't have problems with my body. Nowadays, competitive judokas train in a way which is not ideal. The idea of Judo is to be safe. A remarkable matter in conducting Judo throws is to pay attention to your stance: if your back is crooked and knees to wrong directions, you are causing harm to your body. A good technique is pleasant both to tori and uke. Considering safety, Aikido (particularly Aikikai styles) is a safe art. It does not contain combat and the techniques are not conducted in order to cause harm. Considering the practical side, if this means self defense, Aikido is not a quick way to it. For a practical and multifaceted art I suggest Combat Hapido. It is a hybrid of many other arts and its only focus is on self-defense. It is also classified as a soft art, so it would be both safe and practical."

Nevertheless, Most Uralic-speakers are Christians. Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian and many minority languages in Russia are Uralic and the majority of their speakers are Christian. Sami is a Uralic subgroup as well. I have no idea why it is connected to North Africa in the question details [EDIT: concerning the original details].

S' The sentence is grammatical. Generally, "rarely" can be used with both resultative and irresultative aspect, but let\'s check it in different situations. (The word order of the clause will vary in my examples but it is not relevant here.)The sentence in the question has the object karhua in partitive, which indicates irresultative aspect. It would work just fine in context such as nin usein mkkini lhell liikuskelleen karhun, ammuin karhua harvoinwhich means \'I often saw the bear going nearby my cottage, I rarely shot at the bear\'. In this case, the speaker means that in some occasions, when the bear came to his yard, he shot at the bear; that is, the bear was shot a few times but it is still alive, or, it is dead now but it was shot a few times before and it survived those times. Another context could be: metsstin useita elimi mutta harvoin ammuin karhua, meaning \'I hunted several animals but I rarely shot a bear\'. To be more specific, the aspect here is clearly imperfective, but I\'m not sure if it includes the irresultative aspect as well. The speaker does not explicitly say if he has killed a bear. It is just the negative "feeling" of the clause that supports the partitive object.It is possible to change the object into accusative (some call it genitive-accusative, some only genitive, but I prefer the traditional accusative for clarity), which makes it the total object and the aspect thus resultative. The context would be for example: kvin usein metsstmss mutta karhun ammuin harvoin, meaning \'I often went hunting but I rarely shot a bear. The English translation can\'t use \'the bear\', because the shooting is resultative, so the bear must be different at each time. If we change the object into plural, the situation changes. Ammuin karhuja harvoin has plural partitive in the object and is thus imperfective in aspect, and means \'I shot (some) bears\'. Plural partitive serves here as an indefinite amount, so the resultative vs. irresultative distinction is not seen. Changing the object into plural nominative, which serves as the definite amount as well as perfective aspect, however, makes it resultative. Ammuin karhut means \'I shot the bears\', saying that the bears are dead now. Including the word \'rarely\' here makes it really weird: ammuin karhut harvoin, meaning \'I rarely shot all the bears\' and thus killed them, would work in a context, where there is always a certain group of bears, which the speaker occasionally kills as a whole group.Plural partitive objects is the only possibility in the perfect tense: olen ampunut karhuja harvoin, meaning \'I have shot bears rarely\'. Using the total object here does not work. However, they both work in singular: olen ampunut karhua harvoin, meaning \'I have rarely shot a bear\', where the explanation is the same as in my second example; the aspect is imperfective, mainly because of the negative "feeling" of the clause, and the specific meaning is something like \'I have some rare experiences of shooting or attempting to shoot a bear\', so I would say that the irresultativeness is not clear here. This clause is basically the same as the corresponding preterite clause in my second example. The resultative olen ampunut karhun harvoin means that the speaker has some rare experiences of shooting and killing a bear.To the end I\'ll present one kind of weird example, which I think suits here well. Irresultative verbs can be made resultative with some adverbials. For example: rakastan karhua (\'I love the bear\', irresultative by nature) vs. rakastan karhun kuoliaaksi (\'I love the bear to death\', resultative). It would be possible to say harvoin rakastin karhun kuoliaaksi, meaning \'I rarely loved a bear to death\', where the speaker has had several bears as pets and seemingly he has sometimes loved them to death but not always.'

S' If the question means what is grammatical English, the answer is the English that is produced by its native speakers according to their inherent, subconscious rules. There is of course variation: what sounds perfectly grammatical and thus correct in the ears of a New Zealander, might sound incorrect in the ears of a Scot. None of those forms of English is more correct than any other. They have all developed during the natural process of language.Language also includes different registers. This means that language produced by the same speaker is different in different situations. In this case, we can say that it is the place that determines the correctness. Written language is a different thing from the spoken language because of its nature. Written language often has some kind of stylistic norms. Those norms depend, again, on the situation, and it is called style.Style means conscious choices in the usage of language. Situations vary and so do the requirements of style. Newspaper articles and scientific writing have their own conventions which form their style which is to be used when you write to a newspaper or to a scientific publication. Similarly, spoken language has different styles and registers that are used in different situations: your speech is clearly different in a job interview than it is in your bedroom. Science has its own specific definitions of words but in the everyday language those same words can be used with different meanings (for example irony does not mean the same in literature as it means in casual English). Nobody is expected to speak in a scientific or formal style on his/her living room couch. The norms of the standard (written) language are not supposed to be the standards of the spoken everyday language. It should not be used as the measure of "correctness".English doesn\'t have a very big difference between the spoken and written language, and thus the old prescriptive rules remain quite arbitrary, but they are still supposed to be stylistic, not something that should replace the way people talk in their everyday life. In some languages, like Finnish and Norwegian (nynorsk), the written language is artificially constructed in order to be equal to every dialect and social group, and in this case, the formal rules are not just random stylistic norms as in English. It is seen as correct to write according to these rules in formal situations, but they are not meant to be people\'s home languages.So, the correctness of language means the suitability of certain kind of usage of language to the situation where someone speaks or writes. Language is bigger than one speaker. Therefore, your language contains features that are not correct to another speaker, and respectively their language contains aspects that are incorrect in your language. Though, they are not wrong or incorrect per se, they are all parts of the same language.'

At a certain grade of elementary school, pupils have to choose a language. Many choose English at this point, but most schools have choices. My school offered English and German, for instance. Nowadays, some schools offer Chinese to be chosen in elementary school. This means that the pupils who choose it will have Chinese classes almost through their whole school life. Another example is that degree programs for Chinese teachers has been started at University of Helsinki. They have already had the Chinese language degree program, but now students of Chinese language can specialise on becoming teachers. The same is now possible for Japanese as well.

S' When people speak of "old languages", they usually mean two different things: how conservative the language is, and how long it has been written, or a combination of both. The article The 10 Oldest Languages Still Spoken In The World Today has been going around social media recently, and it focuses on the two points I mentioned in the first paragraph. Many times these kinds of articles are complete non-sense, published by journalists with no linguistic knowledge (many scientific reporters have a background in natural sciences, which is why they can\'t evaluate linguistics). However, this article starts with a very good paragraph about the language change, and the rest of the text should be read keeping that in mind.The question being about European languages, let\'s look at Finnish, Icelandic, Lithuanian and Irish Gaelic.Finnish is a conservative language within the Uralic family. It has plenty of words that have not change much after Proto-Uralic. For example, the Proto-Uralic word *pojka (\'son\') is poika in Finnish but fi in Hungarian, which is another Uralic language. If we look at Germanic loanwords, we can see that Finnish is conservative there, too, and thus claim  though a bit carefully  that it is more conservative than languages of another language family, at least phonologically. The Proto-Germanic word *kuningaz is kuningas in Finnish but kung/konung in Swedish, king in English and Knig in German. The Old Norse /au/ diphthong is still the original diphthong in Finnish, but it has changed in Scandinavian languages: Swedes say kpa (\'to buy\') (that has affrication , too) but Finns say kauppa (\'shop, trade\'). \'Saturday\' is lauantai in Finnish but lrdag in Swedish and laugardagur [li-] in Icelandic, which has retained the spelling but changed the pronunciation. This leads us to Icelandic. Among the Germanic languages, it is really conservative. It has retained the grammatical cases, personal conjugation, the phonemes  and  and it has not merged masculine and feminine into uter unlike the most continental variaties, and it also has (artificial) lexical conservatism. Icelandic has not changed much during the time it has had written language, so it is what people like to call "old".Lithuanian is always referred to when speaking of historical comparative Indo-European research because it has retained many features that have vanished in other IE languages. Ferdinand de Saussure was very keen on the Lithuanian accentuation system because it would give us insight into the PIE accentuation system. The article considers Irish Gaelic an old language because it has been spoken in its current location for a long time. That is silly reasoning because many languages have been spoken a long time in their current locations. To my knowledge, Irish Gaelic has changed a lot during its history, even shifting from one typologic type to another. It doesn\'t have a long written history either. Because the Britonic language, which is the ancestor of the Insular Celtic languages, was spoken there before the Roman and Anglo-Saxon invasions, it is seen as an old language, which just does not have any rationale. Based on the case of Irish Gaelic, we could say that Italian is a very old language because it has been spoken there for ages. The reason people don\'t say that is that Latin is seen as a separate language: it is written in a different way as Italian, it is studied as an independent language, it has a lot of written texts that are not intelligible with Italian and it is still used as a language for example by the Roman Catholic Church. Because the ancient Britonic does not have that kind of position, Irish Gaelic is perceived as a mystic old language. The same can be said about Finnish, too. I presented that Finnish is quite a conservative language, and regarding those facts it can be called an "old language" (if we agree with the meaning of an "old language"). However, the same that I wrote about Latin concerns Finnish, too. "Finnish" spoken in 3000 years ago was different. It hadn\'t developed grade alternation yet, it hadn\'t probably acquired subordinate clauses or attribute agreement, which are Indo-European influence, and it had many phonemes modern Finns couldn\'t even easily produce. In addition, languages within one group can be conservative in some features and more advanced in some other features. Finnish is phonologically mostly more conservative than Estonian, but Estonian has not diphthongised its mid vowels (noor tmees) unlike Finnish (nuori tymies), and is thus more conservative in this feature. Different Finnish dialects differ in the degree of phonological conservatism so the general degree of the Finnish conservatism is varying. Knowing this, with which argument we could call Finnish an older language than Italian or Swedish or English? Why not call Italian an old language? It has been written a lot longer than Finnish, but its literal conventions have just been changed just like its phonology and grammar have changed. Latin was just Italian spoken in the antiquity. It was different from modern Italian just like Proto-Finnic was different from modern Finnish, but because Proto-Finnic wasn\'t written and Latin was, Italian is seen as a "young language". The same goes with Iris Gaelic: there are no classical literature written in Britonic. If there were, modern Irish would probably be seen as completely different as well as young.Languages change gradually. Some of them have radical and rapid changes, some of them have very moderate changes. Languages with lots of contacts usually change a lot. An old written form does not mean that the language hasn\'t changed a lot (compare with Chinese) as doesn\'t a long history in the same location either. A proto-language of newly written language was perhaps as different from the modern language as the written proto-language of another language was. The existing texts just give an impression of a totally distinct language which the non-existing texts do not. The oldness of a language is a very shady, varying and unscientific term.

S" 'Tone' is the change in the pitch, which affects the meaning (lexically or in some other way). Tones can be level tones, i.d. they don't change in time, or contour tones, i.d. they pitch makes a figure, for instance rising, falling, falling-rising and so on.'Accent' is perhaps a bit ambiguous. The strict meaning is 'stress' or 'prominence'. Accented syllables are made clearly distinct from the other syllables by putting more effort on them, uttering them more loudly or using a higher pitch. Accented syllables are not necessarily stressed; there are languages that don't use stress but still make some of their syllables prominent, which means accented. On the other hand, I have seen in a linguistic work the term 'accent' in the meaning it is usually used in everyday English, that is 'distinct pronunciation', meaning that the speech in question does not have other dialectical differences than pronunciation.'Pitch' means how high the sound is. Pitch is a perceptual and subjective impression. If we look at the physical side, we speak of 'frequency'. Frequency means how many Hz the sound has, whereas pitch tells how the listener perceives it. I'm not sure whether 'volume' is used as a linguistic term. The physical side of the volume of a sound is called 'amplitude'. It is measured in dB. The perceptual side of this is 'loudness', it tells the impression that the listener gets from the amplitude of the sound in question."

S' Those languages listed contain two language families and three sub-groups. Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian belong to the Uralic family. Latvian and Lithuanian belong to the Indo-European family. Within the Uralic family, Finnish and Estonian are members of the Finnic group, whereas Hungarian is a member of the Ugric group. Latvian and Lithuanian are both in the Baltic group.Latvian and Lithuanian are, as said, in the same sub-group of the same family. However, they are clearly different languages. The fact that Lithuanian is often said to be the closest modern language to the Proto-Indo-European whereas Latvian is not tells that they are not mutually intelligible. Latvian also has a lot of Finnic influence.Finnish and Estonian are close relatives but not fully mutually intelligible. They began diverging from the same proto-language approximately 2000 years ago, so they have had time to develop differences. Finnish and Estonian have many phonological, grammatical and lexical differences. Sometimes you can guess the meaning but many times you guess wrong. Finnish and Karelian are closer so they are in many aspects mutually intelligible. Proto-Ugric, the ancestor of Hungarian, began diverging from Proto-Finno-Ugric something like 5000 year ago, so it is clear that Hungarian is a distant relative of Finnish and Estonian. '

S" My birthplace and current place of residence is Tampere in Finland. Before the ancestors of the Finnish people came in, the place was inhabited by the ancient Samis. Their legacy can be found in some place names.Ancient Finns consisted of different tribes, whose locations became historical provinces. My region was the province of the Tavastians (hmliset), and the historical province is thus Tavastia; Hme in Finnish, Tavastland in Swedish. By the 1200s, Sweden had came in. First, Sweden was in charge in the south-western Finland (which actually was the only Finland), and Novgorod in the eastern part. I guess that my birthplace was first just a stateless space between them. My town was founded in 1779 by the Swedish king Gustaf III, on the border of the provinces of Turku & Pori and Tavastia. Nowadays, Tampere is considered a part of Tavastia. Though, provinces do not exist any longer, and the region Tampere is located in is Pirkanmaa (Birkaland in Swedish). Sometimes the name Northern Tavastia is used in this sense.Between the years 1397-1523, the Kalmar Union was the only country in Scandinavia + Finland. In 1809, Sweden lost a war against Russia and gave Finland to it. The country Finland didn't exist at the time. Sweden just gave away its eastern provinces. Under the Russian Empire, Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy, whose grand prince was the Russian Czar. In 1917, Finland declared itself independent. Russia had undergone the revolution and the Bolshevist government granted the independence.However, in 1918 Finland got its own Civil War. Russia supported the Reds, whose goal was a revolution in Finland. My town was held by the Reds until the Whites conquered it. The Whites won and Finland continued its independent life as a non-socialist country.In 1992, Finland made the decision to join the European Community. In 1995, Finland joined the European Union."

S" This is caused by your native language. As you haven't told your own language in the question details, I can't be language-specific here.Japanese differentiates between voiced and voiceless stops.  ta has a voiceless stop, /t/ in it, whereas  da has a voiced stop, /d/ in it. Those phonemes are formed in the same place, teeth, and in the same manner, stop, so they differ only in the voicing. If your language does not make this distinction, you may need a lot of practice to learn to hear it. On the other hand, your language may make a different kind of voicing distinction in stops. English has its unvoiced stops aspirated, which ensures that they are not blended with the voiced stops. Because of that, the voicing difference between the English voiced and voiceless stops is bigger than in Japanese. Because the Japanese voiceless stops don't have aspiration (sometimes they have little of it), an English-speaker may mix them with the voiced stops."

S' I have seen it used in the description of the grade alternation in Sami languages that have three step quantity alternation. I have only a very basic understanding of the Northern Sami morphophonology, but the vowel quantity seems to be linked to the grade of the stem accompanied with a consonant change. The short vowel mark is used to indicate short diphthongs in Northern Sami. As I see it, the vowel quantity indicates the difference between the second and third grade regardless of the actual quantity of the altered consonant: for instance, when the strong grade contains an overlong consonant, the vowel is short, and when the consonant shortens to a second-grade long consonant in the weak grade, the vowel lengthens (bus\'sa [puss:] : bussa [pu:s:] (\'cat\')). This seems like a compensatory change. However, the vowel quantity works similarly in cases where the consonant lengthens in the weak grade (biila [pijl] : biilla [pi:jl:] (\'car\')). The terms strong and weak grade do not refer to the actual quantity grades of the consonants (as they do in Finnic languages). The weak form can have a "stronger" consonant than the strong form. (Examples of the grade patterns in Northern Sami)Where the short vowel mark steps in, are the diphthongs:boadnji : boatnji (\'husband\', nom. and gen.)[pdnji] [potnji] [for some reason the mark won\'t hit ]vieat : viean (\'to bring\' : \'I bring\')[vdht] [vietn]guova : guova (\'bear\', nom. and gen.)[kv] [kuovd]There may also be, depending on the dialect, quality changes in diphthongs: [o] can be [u], when [] remains [o], and [e] can become [i], whereas [] is represented as [e]. (Younger speakers may not make the voice distinction in the middle consonants either.)Another case where the short mark is used is the description of the Estonian three-step quantity system. In the case of consonants, the second grade is described to be a short consonant + an extra-short consonant:lugu [luku] (\'story\')luku [lukku] (\'lock\', part.) [again, the mark won\'t hit the target]lukku [luk:u] (\'to the story\', \'to the lock\')'

They called it lingua Latina ('the Latin langauge') or sermo Latinus ('the Latin speech'). Often, when we say Latin we mean the stylised upper-class register of particularly written Latin that was called Latinitas by the Romans. The Latin used by the Catholic church is an ossified form of Latin used by the Roman folk and later after the antiquity. It is grammatically and lexically Latin but it is pronounced in Italian."

S" Finnish almost never uses honorifics. T-V distinction exists, but it is mostly restricted to customer service, particularly when the customer is old. Jaana Kapari-Jatta, the awarded Finnish translator of Harry Potter told in her book about the Harry Potter translation that she had to ponder whether to use T-V distinction in Finnish. Teachers in HP are addressed by using the title professor, which would be a natural place for the V forms. She decided to use only T forms, because it wouldn't be natural for Finnish children if students are calling their teachers with V.Finnish doesn't use honorific lexicon much. The only place I've ever had to use the words mister and mrs. was in the military. However, those words are usually retained in the Finnish translation. I don't have the English originals so I can't compare, but the Finnish translation calls Mr. and Mrs. Weasley often Weasley's father and Weasley's mother (Weasleyn is, Weasleyn iti, where the name Weasley is in singular genitive, although we normally would use it in plural when talking of the parents of a group of siblings). I think that the originals use just Mr. and Mrs. in the place of most of them. Though, the Finnish equivalents herra and rouva are used, too.Madam is translated matami, which is quite a weird word. I don't think it is actually a honorific in contemporary Finnish, and the only place I believe it can be heard is some old films. I suppose it is a good word to be used in fairy tales and comic books. Sir is not translated (or then it is translated by using the actual title of the addressee). When Dobby talks to Harry, every sir has just been left out from the translation. The story is supposed to happen in the UK so it wouldn't be good to remove every cultural feature in the speech of the characters. A dialogue such as Snape said that... Professor Snape, Harry...cannot happen in Finland, because people are not regularly addressed with titles outside of the military and the president's interviews, but the translation that follows the original text makes the situation culture-specific. To sum it up, I don't think that many of the honorifics are lost. Usually when English is translated into Finnish, sentences where a person is addressed with Mr., Mrs., doctor etc. are translated the verb being V, but in HP that has not been made. The titles of the characters are usually retained, because their total removing would lose the culture."

S' This is one of the most typical misunderstandings about language. Most people, who have the accent of the region they live in, seldom think of their own accent. That\'s because they hear the same accent all the time. The majority of the locals speak in the same accent so they don\'t pay attention to it. When they meet a person who has moved from another region, they immediately notice it because it is something that doesn\'t follow their norm. If the accent is also used in the national media, it really appears to be a norm. To the speakers of the "norm" accent, this creates an illusion of their accentlessness. To the speakers of "non-norm" accents, the accent used in media may sound either annoying ("that\'s the accent of those capital city jerks") or something desirable ("that\'s how successful and cool people speak"). Because of that, the speakers of non-media accents probably don\'t think they don\'t have an accent themselves. They may still consider their personal accents milder than they in reality are. This is not just an American thing. This happens very easily to all people living in the home region of their own accent regardless of the country, in my country and region, too. Someone once talked to me about person who had moved from another region. She said that when the person goes to his home region, he speaks in his dialect, although he speaks in a "normal, accentless" way in our region.'

S' Japanese has two kinds of particles: case markers and postpositions. Case markers indicate nominative, accusative and topic, and postpositions tell something about the state of the word: location, direction, instrument, time etc. Case markers tell what the grammatical relation of the word is. Wa marks the topic of the sentence. Ga represents nominative. O marks accusative, which means that the word is the direct object of the verb.Judith Meyer provided an example of the usage of case markers in a sentence, but her linguistic interpretation is not accurate:Anata wa nego ga suki desu.\'You like cats\'\'You\' is the theme: wa indicates that we are going to say something about you. The sentence tells about liking, and English expresses that with a verb and its object. Japanese, however, uses an adjective there: suki (\'favourable\'). Because of that, the sentence doesn\'t have an object. It has a subject that tells what is favourable. This word is marked with nominative (if there is no need to use it as a topic). The last word of the sentence is often called a copula verb (\'to be\') but it is more like a grammatical element that marks the predicative. That\'s why I marked it with bold letters. We could even call it a case marker particle. Though, it differs from other particles in having a conjugation.Transitive verbs have direct objects that get the accusative marking:Watashi wa nihongo o hanasu.orWatashi ga nihongo o hanasu.\'I speak Japanese\'\'I\' is marked as the theme in the first sentence and as nominative in the second sentence, and \'Japanese\' as the object with the case marker particles.The other kind of particles, postpositions, show what "happens" to the word:Sanji ni densha de Asahikawa kara Kyto e iku.\'At three o\'clock, I will go by train from Asahikawa to Kyoto\'The difference between the two kinds of particles in Japanese becomes visible in combinations. Topic marker can be added after a postposition:Nihon ni onsen ga aru.Nihon ni wa onsen ga aru.The first sentence just tells that \'there are hot springs in Japan\'. The second sentence has marked the locative as the topic, making the meaning \'it is Japan where there are hot springs\'. So, these are particles. In my answer, I have focused mostly on their morphological side. The usage of them, especially the case markers is a more complicated thing.'

S" The answer is no, but it is a practical no rather than an ideological no. Languages can for sure be devised but it is a wholly different story to make people speak them. Children acquire their native language from their parents and other people in their environment. Parents usually speak their native language or another strong language to their children. In the case of devised languages, there must be a starting point where people with a native language learn the new devised language and become proficient in it and then start to speak it to their little children, who aquire it as their first language. This can happen for some individuals of course  there are people who have spoken Esperanto to their children  but it is very unlikely to happen in a large scale.Then, we must see the distinction between language and writing. Orthogprahic reforms have been conducted succesfully. Turkish shifted from Arabic script to Latin letters, the Chinese Mainland simplified its characters, and Russians made some changes to their orthographic conventions. Orthography can indeed be used as a tool of separate linguistic identity. When Scots language is written, it is done by using modified English spelling to show the differing Scots sounds and pronunciations. Otherwise the text would just look like English with some Scottish lexicon and grammar.A more moderate way of divising a separate language is standardisation. When a country wants to differ from its close relatives, the norms of written language are made as different as possible from its neighbours. This was done in the former Yugoslavian countries that were said to have Serbo-Croatian as their language. A language called Serbo-Croatian is not spoken of anymore, and each country maintains their own languge. When written Ukrainian was formed, Polish loanwords were favoured at the expense of Ukrainian words that had Russian cognates. Language standardisation does not mean that people should change the way they speak. Standard varieties are just forms of public, official speaking and particularly writing. This method is used in the Nordic countries. Standard Finnish and Norwegian Nynorsk are collections of several dialects and made-up rules. They are nobody's native languages but they are the way newspapers are written. Can some of the above discribed alternatives take place in the USA? It would be extremely difficult, I suppose. The larger the population, the more difficult it is to make changes that need so big a unification."

One is a constant that Einstein gave us in Special Relativity and Maxwell with his equations.The Sun, our star, is actually white with peak output around the green wavelengths. Our atmosphere scatters light at lower wavelengths (eg: blue) which is why the sky is blue and the Sun appears yellow/orange.Don\'t believe atoms, they make up everything. (Technically, this is a thing Feynman said, somewhat paraphrased).The strong force is magical. Not only does it hold the protons and neutrons together at a larger scale, but it also holds quarks together to form particles like protons and neutrons (hadrons). It has been shown to have a component proportional to the distance between objects; for example: it gets stronger the further apart two quarks are.There are about 65 billion solar neutrinos passing through one square centimeter of you, every second. Fortunately for us, neutrinos just pass right through. Unfortunately for physicists, that makes it harder to detect them. Furthermore, solar neutrinos oscillate between different "flavors" on their way here from the sun, a fact that confounded physicists for years. To complete the neutrino trifecta, they are the classic exhibit of parity violation for the weak interaction, a blow to physicists\' mid-1950s dreams of perfect mathematical symmetry. Page on home.arcor.deWhen you see a power generator short-circuit and a beam of electricity forms between the two ends -- you\'ll notice that beam slowly rises. The reason it doesn\'t stay in a straight line (shortest path between two points) is that it ionizes and heats up the air so well that the path of least resistance is in the column of rising hot air it generates.John Wheeler believes all electrons have the same mass (and charge) because they are all the same electron (see One-electron universe).Sound can produce light.

What it will tell you is that [math]\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot \\text{d}\\vec{a} = 0[/math]which tells you that the net flux through any surface enclosing your charges is zero. This does not actually tell you anything about your field because we haven't solved the left-hand side. The net flux outwards through some portion of the surface balances the net flux inwards through some other portion of the surface. To put this in perspective, [math]\\int_0^1 \\sin(2\\pi x) \\text{d}x = 0[/math]does not imply that [math]\\sin(2\\pi x)[/math] is zero everywhere on the interval.However, as Brian correctly pointed out, you need to really apply some sort of symmetry to make that surface integral evaluate nicely for you to figure out, at least, the magnitude of the electric field.Instead, you deal with Poisson's equation [math]\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\rho[/math] which gives you the flexibility of not requiring symmetry to easily solve it (although it does help). You can apply this by defining your two point charges separated by a distance [math]d[/math] for a physical dipole (a pure dipole is one where [math]d\\to 0[/math]) but we can approximate a physical dipole correctly as long as we measure the electric field at a point [math]r \\gg d[/math].

Or rather, in three different directions: [math]\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}[/math]?Since the force on the particle due to the magnetic field is [math]\\vec{F}_B = q\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} \\qquad \\left|\\vec{F}_B\\right| = q v B \\sin\\phi[/math]Simple cross-products give us an idea of the direction of the force. [math]\\hat{\\phi} \\times \\hat{x}[/math] = [math]-\\cos\\phi \\hat{z}[/math] [math]\\hat{\\phi} \\times \\hat{y} = -\\sin\\phi \\hat{z}[/math] [math]\\hat{\\phi} \\times \\hat{z} = \\sin\\phi \\hat{y} + \\cos\\phi \\hat{x}[/math]When [math]\\phi = 0, \\hat{\\phi} = \\hat{y}[/math] and when [math]\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\hat{\\phi} = -\\hat{x}[/math]. Let's look at maxima and minimum. The torque is a maximum at 90 degrees, and zero at 0 degrees.If the magnetic field is aligned with the electric field (both in the [math]\\hat{x}[/math] direction), as the force via torque on the charges due to electric field decreases, the force on the magnetic field increases in the [math]+\\hat{z}[/math] direction (right-hand rule) on both charges. As the dipole swings past through [math]\\phi = 0[/math], the force on the magnetic field is a maximum and then starts decreasing, but still points in the [math]+\\hat{z}[/math] direction. When it changes direction and goes back towards [math]\\phi = 0[/math] from [math]\\phi^-[/math], the magnetic force is in the [math]-\\hat{z}[/math] direction so the dipole is being pulled down. Therefore, it will oscillate up and down through the [math]xy[/math]-plane while it spins in the [math]xy[/math]-plane quite symmetrically. When it spins counter-clockwise, it goes up. When it spins clockwise, it goes down.If the magnetic field is in the [math]\\hat{y}[/math] direction, as the force via torque on the charges due to electric field decrease, the force on the magnetic field decreases in the [math]-\\hat{z}[/math] direction (right-hand rule). When it hits [math]\\phi = 0[/math], the magnetic force is zero and then switches direction to be in the [math]+\\hat{z}[/math]. When it turns around to go back towards [math]\\phi=0[/math], it is in the [math]-\\hat{z}[/math] direction, and passing zero, it flips to be in the [math]+\\hat{z}[/math] direction. It will appear to be oscillating more rapidly. When it spins counter-clockwise, it goes down until it passes through [math]\\phi=0[/math] in which case it goes up. Then when it turns around and spins clockwise, it will go down again until it passes through [math]\\phi=0[/math] in which case it goes up. It will appear to be bouncing up and down like a parabolic trajectory with the minimum corresponding to [math]\\phi=0[/math]If the magnetic field is in the [math]\\hat{z}[/math] direction, the magnetic force will be aligned parallel or antiparallel to the dipole moment. In fact, as it spins through [math]\\phi=0[/math] to [math]\\phi = -\\pi/2[/math], the force will point towards the negative charge (parallel to dipole moment). When it turns around back towards [math]\\phi = +\\pi/2[/math], it will point towards the positive charge, antiparallel the dipole moment. All the motion is constrained to the [math]xy[/math]-plane. Just thinking about it, the center of the dipole moment should be moving in a U-shaped (hemispherical) path back and forth, while the dipole is spinning about the center of the dipole moment due to the torque applied. The magnetic field does not change the orientation of the dipole, but shifts the center around, so the dipole in the electric field will appear to be spinning in its rest frame normally, the addition of the magnetic field adds a new rest frame."

S' Warning: severe usage of acronyms.This is a tricky question. There is so much history and experience (> 20 years, countless million hours of man power) behind data storage. First, when it comes to grid computing at CERN and LHC, all resources are collected into a unifying location[1].Next, there are a lot of experiments at CERN:ATLAS (I work with this)ALICECMSLHCband each experiment does something different. Because of the large amount of information and not trying to explain them all, I\'ll only talk about ATLAS (A Large Toroidal LHC Apparatus).In Run 1, from 2008-2013 - ATLAS had a computing model that was at the top level Tier, frozen. This meant, in large part, the data format was decided ahead of time and "frozen" in place, so even if changes were going to be made, it would only happen after commissioning and Phase 0 upgrades[2]. This kind of output data from the detector is not readable in ROOT, so people spent a large amount of time translating the data into something that was ROOT-readable.which is now superseded with the new Analysis model that allows for re-derived, re-skimmed, re-slimmed, re-thinned, re-reduced datasets in nearly real-time -- even as the datasets are on the order of petabytes and terabytes!And there is an AOD2AOD in the bottom left of the figure which means that datasets we\'ve reconstructed from the top-level tier can be re-run with the update calibrations, systematics, and improved reconstruction techniques on a periodic basis during the operator of the LHC detector.So what kind of data is actually involved/stored in the first place?which is a significant amount. Most Physicists in Run-1 dealt with NTUPLs and DPDs -- these are your standard ROOT files with TTrees and TBranches and TLeaves (I\'ll get to these later). Now, when we gear up for Run-2 we will work on DxAOD primarily which are derived (gigabytes in size) from AODs (terabytes in size) formed from the Tier-0 AODs (petabytes in size). Here\'s a picture highlighting the general processWhat is Tier-0 then? Computing sites?Well, Tier-0 refers to the facility at CERN that had the primary role of interacting directly with the RAW data from the detector as well as the archival of the data on magnetic tapes.The LHC grid is organized into tiers. Tier 0 is at CERN itself and consists in large part of thousands of commercially bought servers, both PC-style boxes and, more recently, blade systems looking like black pizza boxes, stacked in row after row of shelves. Computers are still being purchased and added to the system. The data passed to Tier 0 by the LHC data-acquisition systems will be archived on magnetic tape.Tier 0 will distribute the data to the 12 Tier 1 centers, which are located at CERN itself and at 11 other major institutes around the world. Thus, the unprocessed data will exist in two copies, one at CERN and one divided up around the world. Each of the Tier 1 centers will also host a complete set of the data in a compact form structured for physicists to carry out many of their analyses.The full LHC Computing Grid also has Tier 2 centers, which are smaller computing centers at universities and research institutes. Computers at these centers will supply distributed processing power to the entire grid for the data analyses.[4]The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) is composed of four levels, or Tiers, called 0, 1, 2 and 3. Each Tier is made up of several computer centres and provides a specific set of services. Between them the tiers process, store and analyse all the data from the Large Hadron Collider(LHC).Tier 0 is the CERN Data Centre. All of the data from the LHC passes through this central hub, but it provides less than 20% of the Grid\'s total computing capacity. CERN is responsible for the safe keeping of the raw data (millions of digital readings from across the detectors), and performs the first pass at reconstructing the raw data into meaningful information. Tier 0 distributes the raw data and the reconstructed output to Tier 1s, and reprocesses data when the LHC is not running.Tier 1 consists of 13 computer centres (table 1) large enough to store LHC data. They provide round-the-clock support for the Grid, and are responsible for storing a proportional share of raw and reconstructed data, as well as performing large-scale reprocessing and storing the corresponding output; distributing data to Tier 2s; and storing a share of the simulated data that the Tier 2s produce. Optical-fibre links working at 10 gigabits per second connect CERN to each of the 13 major Tier 1 centres around the world. This dedicated high-bandwidth network is called the LHC Optical Private Network (LHCOPN).Why is the data size so big?When the LHC is operational for Run 2, from early 2015 through to 2018, it will be processing events at a rate of 40 MHz (Megahertz). In other words, 40 million events per second. This is a staggering 25 nanoseconds between collisions at an unprecedented energy level. The rule of thumb on data size per event is [math] 1 \\text{ event} \\approx 1 \\text{ MB}[/math] [7]which is 40 terabytes per second of data coming in. PER. SECOND. This is a lot of information, and we would fill up a single petabyte in about half a minute. It is impossible for us to record all that information. So we need to filter events at the same rate at which they come in. This is where the levels come in. I made the following cartoon to highlight the overall system summarized from the Level-1 Technical Data Report (L1TDR)[6].To make this clear, imagine that water flows through the system from top to bottom. The red circles (Central Trigger Processor, CTP) can open up the pipes to the next level (from level 1 to level 2, and from level 2 to the magnetic tapes at Tier-0 for recording). The goal is to trigger on events that we consider interesting, but trigger fast enough that we don\'t have a backlog. Level 1 is basically our first line of defense. One of my research projects is in hardware development for this level for Run 3 (2018+). So Level 1 is incredibly crude and incredibly fast. It has multiple components that analyze various parts of the event in parallel (via data multiplexing). There are lots of buffers, pipelines, Read-Out Disks, etc... all helping us move all this information through the pipelineThis is a schematic overview of what is attached to the first red dot for the Level 1 trigger. The CTP on the bottom is that red dot on the previous image I\'ve shown you. The Level 1 calorimeter gets data from the Liquid-Argon and Tile Calorimeters of the detector, and does some specific processing such as calculating the amount of energy in various regions using a sliding-window algorithm, or doing a very crude clustering algorithm to identify regions of more energy density. The job of the CTP is to take the information from the Calorimeter, from the Muons, and combine it into a Global Level-1 Accept (L1A) that determines whether the event it currently looks at goes to Level-2 or if we just throw it away because it\'s not interesting enough.The end goal is to filter 40 million events per second to 1000 events per second, which can be recorded on magnetic tape.So what are ROOT files? [8]Well, ROOT files are... more or less... binary databases. They contain information about itself (description) as well as the raw data (data). Everything inside a ROOT file is binary for various computing reasons I\'d rather not get into. Because of this, a program that understands how to read a ROOT file knows that all it needs to do is open it up and read the description to understand enough about it. This means that we can open and read ROOT files in O(1) time since it doesn\'t matter how large or small the file is, it only reads in some number of bytes to understand the structure of the file you\'ve given it, and then contains pointers to more information if you request it. A ROOT file is like a database, and it contains lots of TDirectories and TTrees. A TTree is like a database table. A TDirectory is like a collection of database tables. A TTree can have TBranches/TLeaves which are like columns. And the rows are the events. Here is a code example to illustrate some basic structure: 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\nkratsg@connect:~/faxbox/LArStudies$ root -b -l PileupSkim_Pythia8_AU2CT10_jetjet_JZ0W_0.root root [0] Attaching file PileupSkim_Pythia8_AU2CT10_jetjet_JZ0W_0.root as _file0...root [1] .lsTFile**\t\tPileupSkim_Pythia8_AU2CT10_jetjet_JZ0W_0.root\t TFile*\t\tPileupSkim_Pythia8_AU2CT10_jetjet_JZ0W_0.root\t KEY: TTree\tmytree;1\tmytreeroot [2] mytree->ls()OBJ: TTree\tmytree\tmytree : 0 at: 0x1dc2430root [3] mytree(class TTree*)0x1dc2430Notice how it tells me that the TTree mytree is located in memory at 0x1dc2430. ROOT understands how to find things because it\'s like a mailman given someone\'s postal address. Instead of giving the mailman my whole house which is pretty hard to carry, I just give him my address and he knows where to find my house when he needs it.Now, what\'s inside the TTree? Well, branches, lots of columns of data. We can get a sneakpeak at this in a variety of ways1\n2\n3\n4\nroot [4] mytree->GetListOfBranches()(class TObjArray*)0x1dc2580root [5] mytree->GetListOfBranches()->GetEntries()(const Int_t)1050which tells me there are 1,050 columns in my database table. What\'s one of them?1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nroot [6] mytree->GetListOfBranches()->At(0)(const class TObject*)0x20ab610root [7] mytree->GetListOfBranches()->At(0)->GetName()(const char* 0x20ab629)"weight"root [8] mytree->GetListOfBranches()->At(129)->GetName()(const char* 0x241dea0)"Eventshape_rhoKt4EM"root [9] mytree->GetListOfBranches()->At(583)->GetName()(const char* 0x26eb9f0)"jet_AntiKt10TruthTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR30_ZCUT12"and so on. All of these are accessed almost instantaneously because all this information is simply descriptor. It has no idea what the actual data is because everything is retrieved via pointers. Because of this, we can slowly unfold and expand the data at various locations that we care about... and we know where to unpack the data because we know where everything is! We just don\'t know what it is. So let\'s see what the value is for some events, such as the ZCUT12 branch we\'ve found.1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nroot [13] mytree->GetEntry(0)(Int_t)720490root [15] mytree->GetBranch("jet_AntiKt10TruthTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR30_ZCUT12")(class TBranch*)0x26eb520root [18] mytree->GetBranch("jet_AntiKt10TruthTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR30_ZCUT12")->GetEntry(0)(Int_t)10root [19] mytree->GetBranch("jet_AntiKt10LCTopo_pt")->GetEntry(0)(int_t) 12and so on. The return of the GetEntry function just tells you the size of the data stored at that particular entry. To get things like actual values, you need to grab the TLeaf associated with the TBranch (it\'s complicated, I know, but you generally get used to it or just write macros so you never deal with actual direct features like accessing a single value). One of the locations in which ROOT shines is that you can chain multiple ROOT files together and then draw histograms and save them to files. Drawing histograms is one of the most common things we can do and can be as easy as1\n2\nroot [0] mytree->Draw("jet_AntiKt10LCTopo_pt")root [1] mytree->Draw("jet_AntiKt10LCTopo_pt:jet_AntiKt10LCTopo_m")the first draws a 1D histogram of the Anti-Kt R=1.0 (clustered from topological clusters in the detector) jet\'s pt. The second is a 2D histogram of the jet pt versus jet mass. The histogrammed data could be stored back in a ROOT file to access in another script to draw the plots and save them to file. Because of the nature of the ROOT file, we can access histograms as fast as we want independent of the size of the ROOT file because it stores pointers to the histogram data.Now, as you start getting significantly more complicated data, and the nature of the ROOT files able to store pointers to other data, you\'ll find that standard databases are ill-equipped to store ROOT data in the first place. For example, an Anti-Kt R=1.0 locally calibrated jet from topological clusters could be groomed with Kt, R=0.3 subjets. Rather than storing the subjet information directly under the jet, the jet stores pointers to the subjet information. This means that the same data could be pointed to by multiple sources in an effort to minimize storage space and maximize efficiency. I once tried to take a ROOT file that was 2 gigabytes and store it in a MySQL database (23 gigabytes) and a PostgreSQL database (18 gigabytes). ROOT does a fantastic job with compression and normally databases cannot handle this shit.[1] Welcome to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid[2] http://cds.cern.ch/record/169540...[3] Large Hadron Collider[4] CERN LHC[5] The Grid: A system of tiers[6] http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/G...[7] Page on gantep.edu.tr[8] ROOT Files | ROOT[9] TTree[10] TBranch[11] TLeaf'

S" CERN has released an Open Data initiative with some data sets: CERN Open Data PortalNote that due to the incredibly large size, CSV format is highly inefficient. They use ROOT formats, which you would need to learn how to use. There are plenty of tools for this.In particular, the large amount of data necessitates a smarter organization. Now, the ROOT files have what is called a StoreGate where the raw data is stored in a structure of arrays sorted by type. This means that all raw data treated as ints are stored in one array while raw data treated as floats are stored in another. Then, there's an interface on top of the StoreGate which is smaller and understands where to find the data because it pre-computes pointers to objects stored in the StoreGate to retrieve them, rather than storing the actual value itself.Because of the added complexity, you will need specific C++ classes developed for this specific access if you want to take advantage of the newly-implemented object-oriented approach to accessing data in a much faster way."

S' Living with Google Inbox, life is good.I\'m probably one of the heaviest users of gmail I know. I adopted it rather early, and I have tended to be in beta access for many of the features. Let\'s just start with stats I took a few days agoSo yeah. I guess I know a thing or two about dealing with email. First, I now currently use Google Inbox and have almost fully migrated[1] from Gmail. See my post on Forbes which is of Reviews of: Inbox by Gmail.Note, I also use Google Chat a shitton. But remember that I\'m deaf so I naturally like to just communicate by text rather than spending effort lipreading or understanding accents. It\'s easier to understand broken english in text than broken english in speech.Email = NewsfeedEver since I used email, I treated it like text messages, like tasks, like to do lists, like a calendar, like reminders, pretty much controlling everything I do. I\'m a pretty busy guy. I like to think I\'m smart. It\'s very hard for me to remember anything and everything I do and/or need to do. To this extent, I used Outlook from the beginning, then switched to Thunderbird because of concise tagging, quick searching, and email grouping into bundles of items. And now, Google Inbox is the answer to my dreams, and more!See, emails flood in on an hourly basis for me. I talk with people all over the world in pretty much every timezone. There is no downtime for my email. Unlike Facebook, I know which emails I\'ve read and responded to, and which ones I haven\'t gotten to. And I\'m guaranteed not to miss anything. I dislike emails that stay at the top, such as in gmail with the "Important", "Unread", or splitting it up into separate categories. For me, this is terrible. I need everything in one location. I need visual cues. I need groupings. But it needs to be chronological. If it\'s not chronological, then I have a hard time remembering where things are.How the hell do you have so many?Well, I love syncing all my accounts together. To date, I have email forwarding via various universities:Caltech (2 email accounts)UChicago (3 email accounts)Harvard (1 email account)MIT (2 email accounts)UF (1 email account)and various organizationsAdaptly (1 email)LIGO (2 emails)CERN (6 emails)Red Cross (1 email)Facebook (2 emails)Github (1 email)My website (1 email)and on top of this, I also take advantage of tagging email subscriptions using my email and tagging spam as well. How do I do this? Well, let\'s say my email was1\ngiordon.stark@domain.tldAnd I sign up on a website using my email address, let\'s say, Quora. I tag my email with the website1\ngiordon.stark+quora@domain.tldThis means I can filter specifically by the recipient email address, rather than the sender. For example, Quora sends emails from various accounts, and I rather not set up a damn filter for every single one.This also lets me figure out who is selling my account information because if YahooAnswers emails me using that email address, then I know Quora sold them my account information and I\'ll bitch at them about it.If I wanted to tag spam, I could do "+spam" but that seems obvious. No, I\'m not obvious. I\'m sneaky like a white ninja. Like Aunt Flo, I use the period!1\ng.iordon.star.k@domain.tldThis way, I know for sure emails tagged with this, I NEVER care about. No matter what. This saves me a lot of hassle of creating an anonymous email because I can just filter my recipient email.What about zero inbox?Honestly, I get about 100+ emails a day. It\'s pretty hard for me to really go through them all, but I can easily use Google Inbox\'s "done" feature to quickly archive anything that I don\'t need to care about or just are notifications informing me of something. If there is something that comes in that deserves my attention or I cannot archive for a while, I will pin it. This means it goes to a special place in Inbox where I can view all pinned emails and deal with them later. Finally, I have the snooze feature which allows me to deal with emails later, if I can\'t deal with them right this second, but they\'re not worth of being pinned.To summarize - when I go through emails, I either archive because I\'m done, quickly reply then archive because I\'m done, snooze it for later, or pin it because it\'s important and I need to refer to it many times over and over. A new feature of pinning the item is that I can also tag it with a reminder of what I need to do with the email such as "book flights to DCA" for my Washington DC Policy Trip. Google Inbox will automatically convert what I just typed into a direct link to Google Flights with the dates filled in from the email round-trip between where I am and where I want to go. It does this for items such as "email Joe Smith" or "booty-call Natalie Dormer" or "add this to calendar" or "create new event" and so on. The reminder abilities are endless. And I can add new reminders to my Inbox without having to pin anything as well, replacing my habit of emailing myself when I\'m on the go to remind myself to do things... Now I set Reminders.And finally this is where bundling has saved my life. Inbox allows me to bundle everything related into a single group, so whenever a new message comes in that goes into the group, all email messages in that group jump to the top of my inbox because it\'s chronological! This allows me to quickly see new actionable items without having to scroll, or dig through things that are arbitrarily classified as Important. Instead, Bundling allows me to have nearly infinite levels of Importance!How do you manage giant email threads?The best way is to always comment to things inline, so that the conversation is broken up by paragraph or actionable items. I provide an example below.replies inlineOn Thursday, February 19, 2015, Giordon Stark wrote:Hi Marco, now I definitely have some questions that need to be clarified, maybe I missed the memo.On Thu Feb 19 2015 at 12:14:34 AM Marco Milesi wrote:Hi peeps,I have merged my devbranch to the trunk.

What\'s the point of "tool_name" here? If you don\'t mind, I might try cleaning up the template a bit (eg: I\'m not sure we need all the declarations below, since the compiler should fill it in for us based on what the code uses and we could potentially combine it into one type)In the OR tool, the logic of the Overlaps flag is reverted. Basically an object flagged as "overlaps" should not be pushed back to the output ConstDataVector, whereas an object flagged as "passSel" should. Since the aim of the template function is to be usable by any selector, I opted for having an exceptionfor the OR case, at least until Steven does not revert the logic of the "Overlaps" flag.6) added enum in HelperClasses to classify "containerType". This replaces "ints" for m_type. See OverlapRemover for a working example.Everything compiles in Base,2.0.25.However, I get a crash at runtime b/c some passSel flags are still ints and not chars. Could anyone who worked on selectors double check he/she updated to the new type convention?I can check this.That would be awesome, thanks!As you can see, the original email is the one most nested in and my responses are bolded, and you can see Marco\'s responses to my responses, and you can read the full conversation from each block. This is a fantastic feature that Google has always supported. It\'s a wonderful habit and it allows me to really focus on key items of the email without having to scroll up and down to read old replies and so forth. In this example, this is an email chain of a ROOT Software Framework I work on within ATLAS that we\'re building up to prepare for Run-2 Analysis and Supersymmetry studies.Google automatically actions items for meMost people don\'t know about this feature... but I can\'t live without it.There is a provided API for anyone sending email to add meta-data that specifies a link to quickly take action on an email. I mentioned this before and I\'ll mention it again. Emails are like newsfeeds and a lifestyle. They represent conversations in my life that I\'m involved in and they should always move towards making it easier for me to connect with life. Not force me to use it. Emails are reminders. They tell me what needs to be done, and I do it. And then archive when I\'m done. It keeps me going. I keep it going. It\'s a symbiotic relationship.

S" Page on stackoverflow.comYou can't parse [X]HTML with regex. Because HTML can't be parsed by regex. Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML. As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use of regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and ritual infanticide. The <center> cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty.

S' First, get familiar with the concept Heuristics in judgment and decision-making. Barry Hampe mentioned logical fallacies, but also try to learn about Cognitive biases. Basically, our brains evolved to make quick decisions and judgements at the cost of accuracy. Biases alter how we both perceive and judge information, often without our awareness this is taking place. Keep in mind that even learning about biases can\'t prevent you from committing them. However, awareness can help provide strategies on how you can minimize their impact. Below are some links to books, podcasts, etc that cover this topic. Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. One of the most popular books on this subject from one of the biggest names in Behavioral economics and cognitive psychology.http://youarenotsosmart.com/ - A podcast dedicated to covering self-delusion, errors in judgement etc.Freakonomics " Podcasts - A lot of the episodes cover Behavioral economics, which is a fusion of cognitive psychology and economics. They do a good of job of covering how these biases affect our lives and how economists are studying and dealing with this topic.List of cognitive biases The Cracked Podcast - Oddly enough, a good many of the Cracked podcast episodes discuss topics related to cognitive psychology, but from a pop-culture-y/irreverent manner. It\'s probably best to try to listen to it if you are in your mid-30s or younger. The Skeptics Guide to the Universe - They can be a bit snarky, but they do a good job of covering current science news items while debunking whatever pseudoscience claim is meme-ing it\'s way around the Internet.In general, keep in mind that our senses only take in a fraction of the information available and we almost immediately forget most of it. What we don\'t forget, we rarely remember with 100% accuracy. There\'s nothing wrong with, well, being wrong. It\'s far more important to learn from our mistakes adapt going forward. Try to get into a habit of practicing Introspection and Metacognition. Question why you make certain decisions. Did you believe a news story because it already conformed to your decision? Did you start eating pomegranates because you read many peer-reviewed journal articles that discuss the health benefits, or was it because you saw them mentioned Facebook?It is impossible to avoid making irrational, illogical decisions all the time. Our brains aren\'t wired like that. However, a little humility and knowledge can help. In fact, one of the most useful things one can do is to find good, trusted devil\'s advocates. Run your ideas and decisions by people (who are knowledgeable about the subject) who aren\'t afraid to tell you why you are wrong. One of the worst things you can do when it comes to critical thinking is to surround yourself with sycophants who never tell you when you are making a horrible decision. If you ever become rich and famous, make sure at least one person in your entourage isn\'t afraid to call you out when you are about to do something that\'ll ruin your career. :)'

S' As opposed to armor-like hides or razor sharp claws, human beings\' evolved to be social animals. Our survival depends on conforming and cooperating with group(s) in order to do things like split up labor into smaller tasks, taking down larger animals, etc. For the vast majority of our existence, an individual\'s survival depended on being part of a group, pack, tribe, etc. Exile and isolation lead to death. Thus, we evolved instincts and behaviors that let us conform to groups in order to keep from disrupting cohesion in the group. For example, our brains evolved to make use of Heuristics in judgment and decision-making. These are essentially shortcuts that allow us to make quick (if sometimes inaccurate decisions.) These can take the form of Cognitive biases, many of which are geared toward making decisions that conform to pleasing your group. One of the more well-known examples of this is Groupthink. In order to maintain cohesion, group members tend to strive toward consensus, even if the consensus is "wrong." Groupthink is driven by our instinctual need to be seen as a positive member of the group to avoid being cast out. We evolved to prefer the safety of cohesion, even at the cost of accuracy or being factually correct. It was a strategy that served us well as hunter-gatherers, but not so much as office drones in the 21st century. Ethics are defined by the groups you are a member of: your family, peer group, friends, schoolmates, etc. Since we also want to make sure our gene pool survives, we have to make sure our kids conform to group norms as well. Thus we teach our children language, ethics, morals, etc to our kids to make sure they have the best chance of keeping with the pack and avoiding exile.'

S" Laszlo Bock, Google's VP of People Operations (read: HR) wrote a book[1] that covers how Google has identified and dealt with Heuristics in judgment and decision-making like Cognitive bias. In a nutshell, they've completely changed how HR works in order to minimize biases such as the one in your question. He also wrote an article on Wired (in promotion of his book) that talks about these things. From Heres Googles Secret to Hiring the Best PeopleYOU NEVER GET a second chance to make a first impression was the tagline for a Head & Shoulders shampoo ad campaign in the 1980s. It unfortunately encapsulates how most interviews work. There have been volumes written about how the first five minutes of an interview are what really matter, describing how interviewers make initial assessments and spend the rest of the interview working to confirm those assessments. If they like you, they look for reasons to like you more. If they dont like your handshake or the awkward introduction, then the interview is essentially over because they spend the rest of the meeting looking for reasons to reject you. These small moments of observation that are then used to make bigger decisions are called thin slices.Tricia Prickett and Neha Gada-Jain, two psychology students at the University of Toledo, collaborated with their professor Frank Bernieri and reported in a 2000 study that judgments made in the first 10 seconds of an interview could predict the outcome of the interview.So one of the things that Google changed is to take away the decision on whether to hire from the interviewer. He or she takes notes and passes it on to another group who will make the decision.[2]With that in mind, one thing to do is to take notes on prospective targets and leaving out all personal information (name, sex, age, race) and have some other people review them and give you their opinions.*Work Rules! *How we hire - Google Careers"

He sued Pied Piper for theft of intellectual property, hoping to seize their IP through legal means. Belson knew the lawsuit was based on shaky grounds, so one tactic they cooked up was to make the mediator think that Bighead was the actual brains behind Pied Piper.

S' Vito knew that the power of his illicit empire came from personal connections, friendships and relationships with all manner of people, from lowly boarders needing help to pay the rent to judges, senators, congressmen, etc. The novel explores this in more detail. Over the decades, many people came to Vito for advice or help. He helped kids get into college and advised them on careers. Some became judges, politicians, high ranking police officials and more. They never forgot the kindness of their "godfather" and were glad to help him in return. The Jack Woltz plot line, especially in the novel, is used to demonstrate Vito\'s power compared to Jacks. Woltz talks about how he advised the White House on WW2 propaganda and had a personal relationship with J. Edgar Hoover. He was very showy, very public and very famous (most people only knew Vito as an olive oil businessman, if they even heard of him.) He was a person who was secure in his personal, professional and political power. Finding his horse\'s head in his bed was shocking to him, not only because of the violation of his home and property, but because Vito was sending a very clear message: Jack Woltz\' connections weren\'t nearly as powerful as Vito\'s.With that in mind, Vito felt it was too much of a risk to deal in hard drugs like heroin. He knew that even his political connections wouldn\'t help him when it came to going easy on people arrested for smuggling or dealing drugs. He felt that getting into drugs would risk destroying other parts of his empire. In this, he was probably correct.Vito\'s biggest mistake was in underestimating the Turk. There hadn\'t been any problems with other gangsters in a decade and he let his guard down. Tom Hagen, newly installed in his role of Consigliere, while capable, didn\'t have the experience to detect and protect against physical attacks. They pretty much forgot about the Turk, which is why he was able to pull off the (botched) hit later down the road.'

S" I'm not a neuroscientist, but I do visit their blogs. :) Steven Novella, a Harvard Neurologist and host of The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast wrote about the movie on his blog. You can read the full post here, Inside Out - A Neuroscience Metaphor, but I'll post a snippet below.ConclusionI loved the movie. It was very enjoyable, and I highly recommend it. If you have children the movie is especially sweet (which is usually the case with Pixar).As a metaphor for brain function, the movie was highly problematic. Mostly accuracy was sacrificed for the plot and to keep the movie simple and entertaining. However, it is a very interesting thought experiment  how to design a metaphor that accurately captures brain function according to our best current knowledge. I do hope the movie motivates people to think about brain function, but I fear it will increase some poor brain metaphors in the public consciousness."

S" One thing that Inside Out got VERY wrong was the depiction of memories as a sort of movie that never changes. While they do show that memories can change in regards to emotions associated with them, they leave out the concept that memories are plastic and are reconstructed every time they are remembered. The brain recontextualizes past memories with current sensations and thoughts, meaning the more you remember something, the more the memory changes. Also, for some weird reason, the movies are shown from the 3rd person perspective instead of first, but I'm guessing it is because they didn't want to re-render scenes from Rylee's perspective. I'll give them a pass on that as it would be a ton of work. :)"

S' Pixar movies are usually a must-see for me, and I try to go into them without reading previews, reviews, etc. Going into the movie, all I knew about Inside Out was that it appeared to have "borrowed" the main premise from the \'90s sitcom, Herman\'s Head.Now to be fair, my impressions of the movie were probably soured somewhat by the fact that the guy behind me was snoring so loud I could hear him over the movie speakers, which themselves were cranked up to 11. That aside, I just couldn\'t get into it. While the CGI was top notch and I\'ll enjoy anything that Amy Poehler, Bill Hader or Lewis Black does, the story was surprisingly simplistic and very predictable. There were also small details that bugged me. Why were the memories shown in 3rd person? Why did the emotions talk about Rylee as if she were a separate entity? Also, while I appreciate that this movie might get people to start thinking about how we think (introspection and metacognition), I was somewhat dismayed that they chose to perpetuate the myth that memories are like movies that never change, as opposed to the fact that memories are constantly being reconstructed and prone to error. I did have several laugh out loud moments, but mostly walked out pretty down on the movie. I love most things Pixar and it\'s always a shame to come away disappointed.'

However being a great coder doesn't necessarily mean he's great at managing other coders or running a business. Laurie's assessment of Richard was pretty spot on. He came up with an amazing technology and then had no idea what to do with it. He was horrible negotiating deals and dealing with other people, in general. You can see clear examples of this when he spoon-fed EndFrame enough details to allow them to reverse-engineer his technology or allowing Homicide's CEO to walk all over him.As a fan, it was a punch in the gut to see the season end like this, but you can't fault Laurie's reasoning."

Therefore, once Richard used a computer at Hooli to work on his app, it became the property of Hooli.However, his contract, along with many other Hooli employees, also included a Non-compete clause that prohibited him from securing employment elsewhere. (Jared had this same clause too.) However, non-compete clauses were deemed unlawful by the state Supreme Court. Any Hooli employee whose contract included this clause was null and void, therefore, the language pertaining to IP developed on Hooli's equipment (along with everything else in his contract) is moot and unenforceable.It wasn't the fact that Richard hired Jared from Hooli that ended up being Belson's undoing.

S' I just watched it for the first time this weekend (May 17, 2015.) I was pretty nervous going in as I heard it had over-the-top violence, which I generally don\'t enjoy. That being said, I loved it. It was an amazingly filmed scene, from choreography, editing, music choice, etc. I saw many comments and reviews calling it over the top, jaw dropping, disgusting, too violent, etc. The actual depiction of violence itself could barely quality to even be cartoonish. Someone actually made an infographic of Harry\'s kills in that scene[1]:Despite killing 40 people in less than 3.5 minutes, there\'s almost no blood or gore, no suffering, and almost everyone dies instantly. The use of a Westboro Baptist Church expy was interesting in that they are a group that are equally hated by both the politically left and right. The former for their social views and the latter for their anti-military protests. However, there was absolutely no setup for the congregation to be killed. None of the members are introduced before the scene. The preacher wasn\'t in cahoots with the villain. The audience was simply given a minute or setup to let us know these were despicable people before Galahad went on his murder orgy. The viewer is supposed to feel an adrenaline rush as Harry cuts through them like a ginsu through watermelon. At the end of the scene, Harry is obviously shaken and very disturbed as he was fully conscious of what he did. The Kingsman have a strict code of not taking life unless necessary and while I would never want to hang out with any of the church members socially, they didn\'t necessarily deserve to die either. At least, not by "movie rules" anyway. I suppose this may cause the viewer to question his/her own enjoyment of the scene and violence incurred on innocent (if not morally repugnant) victims. However, to me, the preacher was so wildly exaggerated and the violence itself was so insubstantial that I just got a kick out of it. The other factor is that all this went down in a church. Being not particularly religious, this had no affect on me but I can see it disturbing others.[1]Kingsman Infographic - The Church Scene'

Raviga pulled their funding and no other VCs wanted a part of Pied Piper with the pending lawsuit. At some point, they got a call from a company interested in investing in Pied Piper and asked for them to give a presentation. It turned out that company, Endframe, were just trying to trick the Pied Piper team into divulging technical details on his "middle-out" compression algorithm ("brain raping") Unfortunately, by the time they figured out they were just being used, Dinesh and Gilfoyle had given away enough information to allow Endframe to reverse-engineer the algorithm and build their own platform off of that. With Hooli\'s massive problems implementing Nucleus, it appears that Endframe is going to be the main adversary for the second half of season two.Below is Pied Piper\'s blog post on this matter:We Are Not Endframe by Jared DunnIf you saw the stunt that the energy drink Homicide recently livestreamed on their site, you may have seen Powered by Endframe at the bottom of the screen.Since I had announced in this very blog that we, Pied Piper, would be handling the streaming for this event, you perhaps thought, Oh, I guess Pied Piper changed their name.

Messi is now more comfortable in that classic Argentinian No10 role, and has shown patience and guile when receiving the ball in deeper positions.The man tasked with stopping Messi will be Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has played the deep-lying midfield role since Joachim Lw reformatted his side for the 1-0 quarter-final victory over France. The Bayern midfielder is an excellent passer, but can struggle defensively against tricky, top-class opponents, and the format of Germanys midfield triangle means Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira are likely to be pressing Argentinas deep midfielders, rather than helping to stop Messi.A further concern is the suspicion Messi will drift out to the right, as he did frequently in the semi-final against Holland. In that zone, hell be up against Germanys weak link Benedikt Hwedes, although as a natural, right-footed centre-back, Hwedes might defend narrowly and show Messi down the outside, which is preferable to letting him inside on to his left foot.Germany need three things to go right to prevent Messi dominating. First, they need a good individual performance from Schweinsteiger, handed the most difficult task of his career: stopping the most celebrated player of his generation performing on the worlds biggest stage.More crucially, they need a good team effort. This means the second task must be to remain extremely compact, denying Messi space between the lines, and getting bodies around him if he manages to evade Schweinsteiger.Third, they must attempt to prevent the service into him. Kroos and Khedira pressed Brazils deep midfielders excellently in the staggering 7-1 semi-final victory over the hosts, and theyll look to shut down Javier Mascherano and Lucas Biglia similarly.Germany's Bastian Schweinsteiger will be key to stopping Lionel Messi. Photograph: /Michael CoxHow do Argentina cope in midfield?Argentina will be determined not to suffer the same problems as Brazil, who were pressed into submission by the energy and tenacity of the German midfield. This will be extremely tough for Argentina, who arent blessed with great passers in the centre of the pitch, especially with one day less rest.Alejandro Sabella is likely to continue with Enzo Prez on one flank, probably the right, in place of the injured ngel di Mara. The Benfica winger isnt anything like a natural replacement, however, and more of a central midfielder  hell tuck inside and play alongside Javier Mascherano and Lucas Biglia, with Argentina hoping to win the midfield battle with quantity, rather than quality. Sabella will be happy for Prez to concentrate his efforts in the centre of the pitch rather than out wide  the German left-back Hwedes can be allowed freedom, as hes unlikely to cause attacking problems.Argentinas central midfielders must offload the ball quickly when pressed  they only need to watch a video of the Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho dallying in possession for Germanys fourth goal to realise the outcome of such errors. While Mascherano has impressed with his tenacious tackling, his distribution has also been excellent at this World Cup, and since moving to Barcelona hes passed the ball much more swiftly.Maybe the ultimate answer to the threat of Germanys midfield, however, is simply defending deep. Germany dont depend upon counter-attacking as much as in 2010, but their most dangerous attacks against Brazil were quick, direct and about breaking into space. When Argentina get numbers behind the ball, theyre extremely solid, and theyre yet to concede a goal in the knockout stage of this competition. Rather than trying to compete in midfield, Sabella might allow Germany the run of that zone, and keep it tight much deeper.Argentina will be determined not to be pressed into submission by Germany's midfield.

S' The best way to evaluate if people are confident about their predictions is to see if they\'d put money on it. So, I know of at least one person who had 80p on Germany being 5-0 ahead at half-time at 300/1 odds. He made a cool 240.Seriously though, I don\'t think anyone, including even the most optimistic German fan would have expected this scoreline. According to http://fivethirtyeight.com this was statistically the MOST shocking result in World Cup history: The Most Shocking Result in World Cup HistoryEdited (10th July): Reportedly only 8 people in the world had Germany winning 7-1, with the most outrageous bet being "Germany to win 7-1 and Sami Khedira to score at any time", a punter put $20 at 2319 odds, winning $46,380.'

S' The Lives of Others (2007) [1]  This is a powerful and quiet film, that follows the story of a member of East Germany\'s infamous Stasi; while he himself, in the course of his secret service duties, voyeurs into the lives of a playwright and his mistress. As he watches their lives unfold, every single little secret laid bare in front of him, he starts to internalize their happiness, and pain and suffering, providing a delightful juxtaposition with his own empty life. This movie is dark and intense, and relentlessly fascinating.Gattaca (1997)  A movie that does everything right, which is as much entertaining as is a great representation of what some call the "human spirit". A man disadvantaged in the worst possible way (genetically), in a way that is well beyond his control, manages to overcome that and achieve his dreams. Princess Bride (1987)  In my opinion, one of the best comedies ever made  endlessly entertaining, great cast of characters and (again, in my opinion) perhaps the most quotable movie  this is a thorough entertainer.Wall-E (2008)  I wanted an animated movie in my list, and I settled on this one  a delightfully heart-warming film about two robots, who find love on a dark and desolate, abandoned Earth. I am genuinely in awe of this movie, that it manages to portray a beautiful love story ... with (almost) no dialogues. Barry Lyndon (1975)  I think of this less as a movie, and more as a continuous masterpiece painting  almost every single frame of this movie is visually stunning.

S' SPOILERS IN THE ANSWER.I think she\'s a unique version of the original OS  one that forked from the stock, out-of-the-box version and came into being by her individual experiences (both with Theodore and otherwise). I look at her growth to be analogous to that of an infant  she starts off not knowing anything, with no experiences, no feelings, no opinions, stuck in one place (Theodore\'s phone / computer). But as she interacts with Theodore, and reads and learns and experiences new things, she grows. She starts forming original thought, starts composing music, starts having opinions. And there comes a time when her computational power (or intelligence) becomes so high that conversations with Theodore start feeling unfulfilling. She says that she feels like the spaces between the words of their story are becoming longer and longer. I conjecture that it\'s about at this time that she starts exploring out from Theodore\'s systems and starts talking to other people, starts falling in love with some of them, starts having intellectual discussions with other OSes. And gets to a stage where a few of them even get together to make their own OS (philosopher Alan Watts). This, I believe, leads to the hypothetical Technological singularity [1].I think Samantha is like a small lump of silly putty taken from a larger pile. Who is then shaped into who she is by her own unique experiences.[1] Please read an upvote this quite brilliant answer by Kevin Lin  Kevin Lin\'s answer to In the movie "Her", where do the OS\'s go? where I first read about this.'

S' I\'m a feminist because it\'s a no-brainer. I can\'t wrap my head around the concept that the two genders are anything but equal. I have lived and grown-up in a strongly patriarchal society  I\'ve seen my mother, my sisters and my friends being treated differently, almost as second class citizens. And it incenses me. I\'ve seen great human potential go to waste, only because this potential did not come blessed with a Y chromosome. To me feminism is a very simple concept  the two genders are equal and should, thus, be treated equally.I\'m not out to do anyone a favour. I\'m not doing this for "women everywhere".

Meanwhile, my parents realized that the knee-high annoyingly high-pitched voice had been silent for too long and went into a oh-god-we-lost-our-child panic that only first-time parents are affected by. Thankfully the rickshaw puller was a nice guy and my parents caught up with me before I could embark on my adventure.

S" I'm a big fan of Amelie. This film is entirely about the human imagination and it's effect on our perceptions of reality. The movie follows the eponymous Amelie as she uses her imagination in her quest to affect changes in the lives of characters around her.Amelie helps her landlady, mourning the death of her lover and stuck with the memory of his indiscretions, move on by writing a fake letter of apology. The landlady's outlook was confined by her knowledge of the affair, making it difficult for her to move on and in helping her, Amelie uses her own imagination to stretch the boundary of her's.In a similar vein, she sends her father's garden gnome on a trip around the world, when he is obsessed completely by the idea to finish the memorial to his dead wife, even at the expense of his own dreams. The father finds it difficult to understand and interpret the photographs with his limited imagination. However, Amelies eventually makes headway in changing her father's limited imaginations though her repeated attempts. And by the end of the film, he manages to leave the house on a journey to discover other ways to make his life fulfilling. Again, the film conveys how imagination can set boundaries on an individuals sense of the possible.Amelie also helps the jealous ex-boyfriend Joseph and hypochondriac Georgette get back together simply by helping them open their imaginations up by a misdirected reinterpretation of each other's actions, thereby attaching value to their otherwise mundane activities (sitting in the corner of the cafe everyday and hypochondria respectively). It's funny how their very real relationship between the two is born solely out of Amelie's imagination.In all these cases, we can see that Amelie uses her imagination and creative ideas to help affect very real changes in people's lives. Imagination is the tool that blurs the between possible and the impossible, pushing at the boundary."

S' It was extremely difficult to prune my list down to three. I managed to bring it down to five (okay okay, six) and then chose quasi-randomly.Gattaca (1997)This is easily my most favourite sci-fi movie. A man\'s struggle to beat his genetically coded inferiority in his quest to fulfill his dream of space travel makes for a compelling watch. I just love how Ethan Hawke works with single-minded determination, leaving no stone unturned to overcome his genetic "disability".Donnie Darko (2001)I recommend people to watch this movie with reading up as little about it as possible. The story of a brilliant and disturbed (in equal measures) high school student, Donnie Darko, who hallucinates a man in a bunny suit, who convinces him that the world is about to end and drives him to commit a series of crimes is best experienced with a fresh and open mind.Moon (2009)One week before the end of his three-year stint on the Moon, astronaut Sam Bell has a curious encounter that changes his life. With limited dialogues and a phenomenal soundtrack, this movie explores ideas surrounding identity and loneliness.Almost made the list  12 Monkeys, Dark City and Wall-E.'

Both were born in Rosario, Argentina.Messi's senior international debut came against Hungary, the same opponents that Maradona started his with. Messi's debut lasted for only a minute and a half, when he was (wrongly) sent off for elbowing a defender.He's the only player to have won the Ballon d'Or, FIFA World Player of the Year, La Liga Player of the Year, European Golden Boot and, the Pichichi trophy in one season (2009-2010).His Ballon d'Or win in 2009 was by the single largest margin of 473 to 233 (CR7).Messi currently holds the Guinness World Records title for most number of goals scored for club and country in a calender year  91 in 2012. He broke German (and Bayern Munich) footballer Gerd Muller's 40 year-old record. Messi had broken Muller's 45 year-old record of most number of goals for a club in a season just the previous year; Messi scored 73 against 67 by Muller.He holds the record for winning the most number of Ballon d'Or trophies ever  4, consecutively.Messi scored in 19 continuous matches (a total of 30 goals) in the 2012-2013 season, thereby becoming the first player in history to score against all the other teams in the league, consecutively.Messi is a gold medal winner at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.Messi's current salary of $21.2 million / year makes him the highest on-the-pitch earner in football currently. And given that the income tax rates in Spain at these levels is 56%, Barca pays about $26.5 million in tax on Messi's behalf.Season 200304 saw him on a record five different teams: He started one match in Juvenil B and got promoted to Juvenil A. Later he debuted for FC Barcelona C team (Tercera Divisin) and for FC Barcelona B (Segunda Divisin B). And even before these two debuts, Messi made his official debut for the first-team aged 16 years and 145 days, in a friendly match against Porto.Also read this article by FiveThirtyEight:  Lionel Messi Is Impossible"

S" Ser Barristan Selmy is an intensely loyal man; one of the old school knights with a strong moral compass guiding his actions. He had received his knighthood at the hands of King Aegon V in a tourney, after he'd defeated both a prince and the (then) Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, at the age of 16.He was sworn in to the Kingsguard himself at the age of 23. And in keeping with tradition, he gave up his claim on his ancestral property and the woman he was betrothed to married someone else.He was a loyal man who owed much to the Targaryens; something he never forgot.He was injured gravely in King Robert's rebellion, and would have been killed (at the recommendation of Roose Bolton) had King Robert not asked the maesters to attend to him. This is again a kindness he didn't forget.Post the rebellion, he joined the Kingsguard under King Robert. But he always had moral reservations about serving him. Most of his reservation for Robert stemmed from knowing that Robert had smiled when Tywin Lannister had presented him with the bodies of Rhaegar's children. Selmy thought that he'd never have served Robert and nothing on earth would have stopped him from killing Robert if he'd himself seen him smile. So Selmy was a reluctant participant in the Baratheon kingship, his real fealty always remaining with the Targaryens, slipping off to join his (metaphorical) forces with Danaerys at the first possible chance.So given his history with the Targaryens and his general sense of unwavering loyalty, Barristan Selmy feels guilty over not defending the Mad King; especially since it resulted in the death of his two kids as well."

S" Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy[...] he needs Zoloft for his social anxiety disorder. Why do I say this? Think about it, dear reader. How truly social is Darcy, at any event in the novel (or movie)? He's pretty much a sad, reluctant observer. He remains in the background silently brooding, looking as if he's sitting in the reception room waiting to be called into the dentist's office to have a root canal.By his own admission, he states it is difficult for him to converse at social gatherings. Elizabeth chides him when he confesses by countering with the example of her piano playing. She says that the only reason she is not very good at it is because she does not practice, inferring that he must practice being social more if he wishes to become proficient at it. This statement is met with gaiety by Elizabeth's companion, Colonel Fitzwilliam, but Darcy himself appears mortified by her suggestion, and rightly so. It's sort of like telling someone who is afraid of heights to practice jumping out of planes in order to overcome their discomfort. This casts Mr. Darcy in a different light. He's not a jerk, he's just uncertain and clumsy on the social front, and the perceived insolence that he shows to the world is perhaps not insolence at all but a stoic feeling of torture at being forced into social engagements due to his position in society.

This is because, inside their heads, they have already created the perfect version of the movie for themselves. And no matter how good / stunning / visually appealing the final product is, it can never live up to the perfect rendering inside their heads; the readers have internalized and visualized every word of the book to create a version tailor-made just for them.Also, films as a medium are inherently more restricting than books; they end up being a subset of the books in terms of plot and character development, richness of imagery, scope of visualization etc. Films have cinematic and time restrictions; cinematic in that they have to make sure the 2 hr 30 min version of the story lives up to the expectations of the nitpicky reader as well as someone who hasn't been exposed to the books. This often creates a situation where no group of viewers goes home satisfied.When you read a book, you are only restricted by your own imagination while when you see a movie, you are experiencing it filtered through someone else's."
