 Marcus GeduldBack when I was in school, I didn't feel bad about it, either. I think it's because I didn't choose to go to school. I was forced against my will, and I hated it. I knew most of the work the made me do was busy work. I learned very little from it when I did do it. And most of my teachers didn't go out of their way to show they respected me as a person. Some people, even under those circumstances, will feel guilty for lying, but it's not odd for people who feel imprisoned to lie to their jailers without guilt feelings. As an adult, my feelings about school haven't changed, but I have more empathy for the teachers. Most of them are terribly stressed and living near poverty. Many don't have a lot of say over what they do in the classroom. I'm not sure that my lying to them was that big a deal. Teacher know students lie. Still, I see them as people in a way I couldn't back when I was a kid. The one other thing I've realized, as I've aged, is that lying can become a habit. Even if you start out only doing it when you're being unfairly treated, it soon becomes a strategy. Each lie tends to make the next one easier. When I realized how much I was relying on lies, I pulled back. Now I'm honest most of the time. I still slip up occasionally, but when I do, I don't say, "He deserved it" or "It's okay, because he's just a stranger." I problem-solve to see what honest strategies I can use when similar situations crop up in the future. Even from a selfish perspective, I'd rather not lie if I can avoid it. Liars sometimes get caught, and the penalties for being caught lying tend to be severe--even more so as an adult than as a kid.
