 Marcus GeduldYou need to make a distinction between feeling-love and behaving-in-a-loving-way. The phase "loving someone" can mean both of those things. Autistics can very easily feel love towards another person. There's no difference between their feelings of love and the feelings non-autistic people have. It's common for autistics to feel affection, to feel attraction, to miss the other person when he or she is gone, to feel the need to sacrifice for the target of their love, to feel proud of the target, to feel possessive of him or her, to feel giving, to feel partnered, etc. Most autistic people aren't totally incapable of understanding other people's feelings. They just have some deficits when it comes to reading social cues. Often, these can be overcome by (slow) learning and by simply asking questions. Also, in many cases an autistic person will have an easier time understanding the social signals of a close friend or lover than those of a stranger or slight acquaintance. He may not know you're tired, but he understands the feeling of tiredness, and he's capable of empathy, so if you tell him you're tired, he'll get it and act appropriately. If an autistic person is partnered with someone who needs to have his or her social cues instantly understood--to the degree that a non-autistic person would probably understand them--then the relationship may not work. At least not at first, before the autistic person has time to learn his partner's signals. However, it's not the case that all non-autistics have high emotional intelligence. It's pretty common for folks who are married to neuro-typicals to complain, "He (or she) doesn't get me!"
