 Marcus GeduldPeople define it in various ways. Here's one traditional way to think about it: In most stories, there's a protagonist who has difficulty achieving some sort of goal. Which may be "getting the girl," "robbing the bank," "solving the crime," or "overthrowing the evil empire."The obstacles he faces get harder and harder to overcome, until finally, near the end of the story, he reaches a point where they will get solved-for-good or become impossible-to-solve. The hero has finally managed to disarm all the bad guy's henchmen. But now he's face-to-face with the bad guy himself, and the bad guy has a gun pointed at the hero's chest. The hero must either find a way to kill or stop the bad guy from shooting him or die. That's the climax. It's when the story's conflict has reached it's final, most-dire peak, and you (the audience) know that the hero is, right now, either going to win or loose for good. The bad guy pulls the trigger, the good guy ducks just in time, the bullet ricochets off a beam and hits the bad guy between the eyes, killing him instantly, solving all the hero's problems. Or the bad guy shoots the hero, who drops to the ground, mortally wounded. We now know the stories is going to have a happy or sad ending. All that's left is a few minutes for the character to react and for the plot to tie up loose ends. Most stories end very quickly after the climax is over.
