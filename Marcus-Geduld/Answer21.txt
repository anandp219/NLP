 Marcus GeduldMost scientists do not dismiss the supernatural. They don't have anything to do with the supernatural, pro or con. Most scientists spend their careers studying things the effect of corrosives on certain kinds of plastics or the life cycle of a particular species of termite.Are you confusing "scientists" with "people who write books and articles that are skeptical of supernatural claims, some of whom happen to be scientists"? Are you confusing "scientists" with "the sort of people who debate on the web--the ones who tend to think of themselves as rationalists, atheists, etc"? There may be some overlap between them and scientist, but scientist is a specific sort of job, and most people who are employed that way have little to do with the supernatural. Science itself is the study of Nature, not Supernature. So this is like asking why plumbers dismiss sewing machines. An individual plumber might like to sew, but his field has nothing to do with sewing. A key aspect of the Scientific Method is crafting falsifiable hypotheses. It's really hard to come up with them for supernatural claims. Some supernatural claims have been studied in the lab. Psychic phenomena have been researched for decades, without so far producing scientific evidence in their favor.
