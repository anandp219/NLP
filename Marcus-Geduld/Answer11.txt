 Marcus GeduldWhat do you mean by "objective information"? If you mean the sort of facts you'd find in a textbook, then no, there's very little on Quora that you couldn't find elsewhere via a google search or by checking sites like wikipedia. What you will find here and nowhere else is lots of personal information. (I don't mean that Quora is the only site where people post personal information. I mean much of the specific personal information here is unique to Quora.) For instance, I have shared a great deal about my productions of Shakespeare plays. Much of it is objective in the sense that it could be verified by 3rd parties, such as the actors involved. There are also some unique-t0-this-site explanations of complex information. Consider that we don't have access to raw data, except when we're the ones who collect it ourselves. All other information, whether we get it from Quora, wikipedia, or the Straight Dope forums, is passed to us via language--usually in the form of text, but sometimes as images, sounds, videos, etc. I've read explanations on Quora that were so well-written, they clarified ideas I'd come across before but hadn't been able to understand. Unless you're searching for incredibly simple facts, such as the capital of Russia, it's worth thinking of all information as within the context of an explanation. A single unit is information+delivery rather than just information, so a wikipedia article on recursion and a Quora user's explanation of it are two different beasts.
