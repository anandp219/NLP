 Marcus GeduldIt's possible that there's a slowest man alive, but his existence or non-existence has nothing to do with whether or not there's a fastest man alive.There could be ...1. One really fast man and a group of other men who are equally the slowest.2. A group of men why are all equally the fastest. And also a group of men who are all equally the slowest. So, you can see, there could be no slowest man whether or not there's a fastest man.There could also be ...1. A fastest man and a slowest man.2. A group of fast men who are all equally fast, with no one faster, and a single slowest man. So, as you can see, there could also be a slowest man, irregardless of whether or not there's a fastest one. You could change this question to "Is it possible to have a slowest man alive?" The if-clause is gratuitous.By the way, there is definitely a slowest man alive. It may seem like there isn't, but, if so, that's an illusion based on limitations of our measuring instruments. If we held a race and three people all ran "equally" slowly, it would turn out, if we could measure with greater accuracy, that each one had actually run at a different speed. Maybe there was less than a thousandth of a millisecond's difference between their times, but that's still a difference.
