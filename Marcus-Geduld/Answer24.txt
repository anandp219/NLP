 Marcus GeduldPeople define intelligence in a variety of ways, so if you want to maximize the number of people who believe you, you'll have to use a variety of proofs or be more specific about what you're trying to prove, e.g. "I have a higher IQ than everyone I know." General Intelligence tests are so easy to find, the first thing you should do is make sure none of your friends see this question. The fact that you needed to ask this, rather than figure it our for yourself with a quick google search, will blunt your credibility. Some IQ tests: - IQ Test- IQ Test (Intelligence Test). More than 50 Intelligence Tests for all ages- Classical IQ TestYou could also join MENSA, which requires you to take an IQ test and which won't admit you unless you have a high score: Mensa International. One admitted, you can show your friends your MENSA credentials. There are many quick tasks you can perform which will convince many people that you're highly intelligence:- Go to a local chess club and beat most of the best players there.- Submit a paper to a highly-respected Science journal, such as "Nature," and get it published.- Spend a month learning a difficult skill, such as playing the piano, speaking Russian (or some other language you don't already know), or programming assembly language. Then get vetted by an expert. Explain that you only had a month to get to your present skill level, and have him go on record about how amazing your progress was.
