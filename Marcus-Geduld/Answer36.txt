 Marcus GeduldIt's not a site for certain things to happen, it's a site where certain things happen. It's a site that makes possible certain sorts of behaviors, and, since people who wish to engage in those behaviors know about the site, those behaviors occur on it. Quora's architecture makes it possible for members to give information to others who seek answers. Some people want to do that, realize that they can do it, and so do it.Quora's architecture also makes it possible for people to get ego strokes, assuming their egos enjoy certain sorts of stimulation that are possible to gain here and also assuming they have the skills needed to use Quora for that end. Since such people exist, they do use Quora for that end. Quora's architecture allows people to pursue both those goals simultaneously, to flip back and forth between them, or to stick to just one of them. All such behaviors are manifested here.To the best of my knowledge, the founders of the site are more desirous of people using it to spread knowledge than for other purposes, but that doesn't change the fact that it can be used for a variety of purposes, including but not-limited-to the one the founders like best.It is virtually impossible to design a complex system, open it up to many people, and ensure it's only used for a single purpose.
