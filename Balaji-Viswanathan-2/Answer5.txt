 Balaji ViswanathanThere is a huge distance between the plains of Ganges & Indus and the plains of Yellow river & Yangtze - separated by more than 5000 km - twice the distance between say Moscow & Paris. It is not just the distance. You have to either walk across this distance over the world's tallest mountains or go around thousands of kilometers by ship through the pirate infested straits of malacca. This geographic barrier has always limited deep links between India and China. That said, the Silk Road between Europe and Asia helped the transfer of ideas between the two civilizations. The Kushans had deep interests in the land route, while the later Cholas had often times controlled the sea route. Indian ideas like Chess (Chaturanga), Buddhism went to China, while getting items like silk and tea in return. Ancient Indian texts like Arthasastra mention of links with China as early as 2nd century BCE and the Hindu epic of Mahabharata is alleged to contain references to China. In the same way, ancient Chinese historical works like Records of the Grand Historian refer to the Indus river.Indian monks such as Batuo and Bodhidharma are also believed to have been instrumental in spreading martial arts culture in China. In return Chinese monks such as Xuanzang and Faxian who toured around India have written precious historical works that are instrumental in understanding medieval Indian history.
