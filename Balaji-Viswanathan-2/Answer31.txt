 Balaji ViswanathanFrance did have a large empire with large territories in South East Asia, north and west Africa. Vietnam was its colony & its war until the Americans "generously" took the mess. Here are the various parts of the world that were one time under French influence. Source: French colonial empireWhy it did not have more?France started late in the colonization game as it didn't have major incentives to go beyond its land while there were major distractions at home (French Wars of Religion and French Revolution). In general, major colonial powers were in the periphery and traditionally had less say in Europe - forcing them to look outward for growth. As the biggest economy in Europe French focus [especially at its heights in Napoleonic period] was in Europe.When its government did conquer overseas territories, the people were not desperate enough to move & settle these new territories. While a number of people of British Isles were moving due to religious persecution and other reasons, relatively less people from France migrated elsewhere. In the absence of big French settlements, many of these territories [like the Louisiana territory] had a lot less French influence and easily assimilated with other regions.French colonization also overlapped with that of the British - leading to major confrontations with a superpower. This was in contrast with Portugal that had a long period of friendship with Britain and other powers, and Spain that had quickly spread its culture to its colonies - leading to its continued influence. Eventually France lost its colonies in the United States, Canada, Caribbean and India to Britain in the decades post the seven years' war. France in the Seven Years' WarAfter Napoleon lost at Waterloo it increasingly had to play second fiddle to Britain and a century later it came under the might of an unified Germany with which it had no natural protections. Both of which further curtailed France from colonizing more.
