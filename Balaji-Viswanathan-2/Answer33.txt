 Balaji ViswanathanAs Rohan Shankar mentions, there is very little hatred for Hindi. Even in Tamil Nadu, the state as far away from Hindi region as possible, Bollywood used to be quite popular and there was always an exchange of movies and musicians between the two regions. Tamil region always had a sizable north Indian population since yore with large Saurashtrian communities in Madurai, Marwari communities in Chennai, Vijayanagar heritage in most of the state and Maratha history in Thanjavur. The biggest bone of contention was not in having Hindi as India's official language, but having Hindi alone as India's official language. People have to learn English anyway as without that we are just frogs in a well. What will be the second language? Will it be Hindi or their mother tongue? When people take Hindi as the second language they effectively get lose their mother tongues and this already seems the case among many elites in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Some people do learn Hindi as the third language, but given the lack of infrastructure it is not always possible to do justice to the third language. Ideally people should be able to learn 3 or more languages. If there are enough teachers and other resources that should be the case. However, if only two languages are to be taught - which one of the three would you drop - the world language, the mother language or Hindi?
