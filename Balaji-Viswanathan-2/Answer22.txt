Page on google.com In 1500, Germany had 4 times the GDP of what is now UK and in 1600 it was about 2 times. Since then colonialism & pro-trade policies helped Britain catch up to Germany and in 19th century even overtook Germany for a brief period. But, it was only brief. By, around 1907, Germany again overtook UK as the former rapidly industrialized in the late 19th century. In the 1930s, Germany was so strong that it could single-handedly take on UK, France and Russia and without the entry of US & missteps of Hitler, the allies were toast. Such economic power don't go away easily. After war, Germany was rebuilt with the help of Marshall plan and was tightly integrated with rest of European economy through EEC and EU.As US and Germany took away its industrial superiority in the late 19th century, UK's economy started a slow slide and by the first world war its economy was weak, living on borrowed money from the US. After the second world war, it lost most of its colonies - on whose back a sizable chunk of the wealth was made - and its economy was not as well integrated with Europe's as Germany's. While Thatcher brought some reforms to get the economy back on track in the late 2oth century, German GDP sprung even further that time with the reunification and the inauguration of the Euro.Japan also carried quite a bit of momentum from its growth spurt in the early 20th century and quickly became the leader of Asian economy. The destruction of the war allowed it to focus almost entirely on the economy, while UK was still distracted in unnecessary conflicts in Suez, Kenya and elsewhere.
