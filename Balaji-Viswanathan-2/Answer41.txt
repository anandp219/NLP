 Balaji ViswanathanWhen you talk about cars from international manufacturers sold in India, you need to understand only some of them are manufactured in India. For instance, Honda makes its City and Jazz in India and for Indian markets. These are relatively cheap, while a Civic that is no longer manufactured in India would be quite expensive. In the same way, not all Volkswagen cars are manufactured in India. Among those that are manufactured in large volumes - Polo and Vento, the prices are in the range of $9000-$11000 and you cannot get any new car in the US for that price. Volkswagen sells Polo in UK for upwards of 11k pounds (New Polo : Volkswagen UK) that is nearly double of its price in India (Instant Free New Car Price Quote). On the other hand, it doesn't manufacture Jetta in India and thus its prices will be significantly high.When you select a car that is not manufactured for India, it gets quite expensive for a variety of reasons:Some or all of the car parts might be imported. That would make it quite expensive. For instance, even if Accord is assembled in India, most of the parts for it is made outside. On the other hand, Honda's other car that is mostly made in & for India - Jazz goes for less than a fourth of its price. The car might not have enough volumes even if manufactured locally. When volumes are low, it increases manufacturing and retail costs dramatically.By looking for a model that is not made for India, you tell the car maker that you are a rich person from whom they would love to make the highest margins. In the US, only entry level buyers buy a Civic while even the middle class go for a Camry or an Accord . Thus, a Civic sold in the US would have lower margins than the one sold in India.
