 Balaji ViswanathanIn the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, Wall Street Journal ran a post about the security condition in India. In that post, there was a quote from a top security consultant who was consulting American tourists heading to India. I will just try to paraphrase his quote from my memory.You should be worried about traveling to India. You should especially be worried about driving to the airport - the riskiest part of the trip. You are many times more likely to die of a road accident in the US than be victim of a terrorist attack in India. The riskiest part of your trip lies in the road between your home and your airport. If you don't fear that, the rest of the trip has far less odds of hurting you. That said, follow the basic safety guidelines [avoid traveling alone in unfamiliar surroundings, avoid walking in the dark, don't get into a stranger's vehicle, don't eat what a stranger offers, don't advertise your plans in the public, don't flaunt expensive things]PS: There is no ISIS operation in India. And Syria is far more closer to UK, France and rest of Europe than India. The distance between Agra and Syria where ISIS operates is more than the distance between Boston and Honduras. If you don't usually worry about the drug cartels of Central America while in the US, you don't have to worry about ISIS while enjoying the Taj.
