 Balaji ViswanathanCommunist Party of India agrees to Indian democracy and in 1951 it made an explicit slogan change from "People's Democracy" to "National Democracy"(See: Communist Party of India (CPI)). Since it doesn't violate any law set by the Constitution and various Parliamentary acts, it continues to be recognized.India has often had an uneasy relationship with the Communist party. The colonial administration had the party banned until 1942 due to Meerut Conspiracy Case and other activities in the 1920s. Soviet Union and Communism was a huge fear for the west at that time. In 1942, the ban was lifted as Soviet Union was fighting along the Allies and Britain needed a counterweight against the Congress that was now calling for "Quit India movement" (Read more: Censorship).The Communist Party of India then started to pick up steam and in 1946 brought successful peasant revolts in Bengal (Tebhaga movement) and Hyderabad (Telangana Rebellion). While these rebellions initially helped the Union - by helping bring Hyderabad to the union, once it was found hard to control the army had to crush the rebellion (Peasant Movements: Telangana Peasant Struggle (1947-51)).As the violent rebellions got crushed, the CPI had to switch from the goal of revolution and had to accept democracy as a way to push social reforms. Even then, suspicions were cast. The state of Travancore had banned the party in the 1952 elections and after they were unbanned in the new state of Kerala to win their first elections in 1957, their government was dismissed by Nehru's central government (Liberation Struggle). In the 1962 Sino-Indian War, further tensions between the union government and communists was found as many communists termed the "internationalists" openly side China in its war against India. However, by the late 1960s, Congress once again warmed to the Communists, as Indira found it hard to fight the Syndicate of old timers (THE LADY v. THE SYNDICATE) and needed new allies.
