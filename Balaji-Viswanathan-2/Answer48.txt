 Balaji ViswanathanIndia doesn't have any developed state. The richest state in percapita income is Goa with an average income around $5000 (GDP per capita of Indian States) and this is comparable to Angola, Jordan or Iran. The reason why we are a single country is because the states can use each other's resources to climb up to the top. Mumbai alone accounts for 10% of factory employment, 35% of corporate taxes and 90% percent of banking transactions. Taxes collected from Mumbai is used for rest of India's development. Page on ied.co.ukIn return, rest of India provides Mumbai the security, the market, the labour pool, etc. Mumbai cannot exist without rest of India and vice versa. Let me cover the emotional, pragmatic and fair aspects here. Imagine India to be a body. The body organs all look different from each other. Are the eyes same as the legs? Are the eyes less important than the legs because they are small? Harm to any organ damages the body as a whole. You cannot cut off the bottom of the leg and ignore that. In the same way, harm to any specific region harms India as a whole. Bihar's poor economy drags India's ratings down. If we don't reduce the number of poor Bihar and UP has, rest of India would also be hurt. If Bihar reduces into a revolution, rest of India would pay a lot in increased security and poorer economy. On the other hand, if Bihar grows rest of India also would grow as companies can sell more and produce more. We have seen the emotional appeal and the pragmatic appeal. Now, let's take fairness. Over the years, Bihar and rest of India's east was ignored both by local politicians as well as national ones. When the outsiders didn't ruin the state, the local leaders made it a point to ruin themselves. Through policies such as the Freight equalization policy Bihar's resources were carted off to rest of India to be used by factories in Mumbai and elsewhere. This hurt the east while the rest grew. Now, it is time to redress the problem and rebuild.
