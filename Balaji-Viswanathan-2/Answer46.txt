 Balaji ViswanathanThere are four Groups that shape the contemporary world politics. Those four are:Religious groupsNationalist groupsMarxist groupsConsumerists / LiberalsThese groups often form a variety of alliances, but still have quite different characteristics. In Indian sense, the first 3 groups roughly corresponded to BJP, Congress and CPI (M). However, in elections like 2014, BJP also attracted nationalists while in a few other elections, Congress has brought the religious groups to them. The Indian Communists center their focus on the class struggle and see the world as a collection of worker class fighting the owner class. In some sense, the nation matters to them less than the class. They often went so close to China that even during war they failed to support India [During China war, comrades cracked down on VS for saying lets give blood to jawans]In 2011, the Communists lost both their core states - Kerala and West Bengal and as the nationalists and religious groups would not vote for the Communists, the party has to rely on fringe groups to get its votes. Thus, it supports whatever random causes it can to get some attention and scrap a few votes. Shouting against nationalists and majority community is a good way to get mentioned in the media.
