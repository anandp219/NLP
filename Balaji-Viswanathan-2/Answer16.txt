 Balaji ViswanathanThere is no proof that this is an blockade, leave alone the Prime Minister is involved in that. Claiming such a thing belies an understanding of the Indian politics. Modi cannot even control the Parliament to get basic bills passed. Indian government can only control its border security forces and that has not happened. Indian government cannot control the truck drivers who would want to make a quick buck. Assuming that the truck drivers would want to listen to PM for no reason and lose their income is plain nonsense. If the truck drivers had gotten instructions from the Indian government not to ply to Nepal, at least one of them would have brought that instructions to the media [truck drivers often support left-leaning parties and both they & the media are anti-Modi]. None of that happened. The drivers would fear random attacks to the truck from protestors than Indian government. The roadblocks seem not to be in India but in the Madhesi dominated territories in Nepal and that is what neutral news sources [not Indian media] report. Nepalese protesters block major trading checkpoint on Indian borderIt is possible that some of the protestors are paid/instigated by the Indian government or not. Again, there is no proof for that. India's neighbors often think of Indian leaders as super powerful men who can build elaborate conspiracies and can get things done at a push of a button. They also assume that the government has the media and rest of the society in control. The truth is they are not bond villains and cannot get even basic things done. They find it hard to manage even basic things in India, leave alone pulling elaborate conspiracies abroad without detection.
