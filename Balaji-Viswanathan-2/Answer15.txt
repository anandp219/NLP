There are a number of reasons this clause is present:Humans want to find if there are living organisms in Mars. That is very important for science. If we contaminate with earthly organisms, we might not ever know about that as earth's organisms could falsely trigger the life detection systems. Introduction of harmful bacteria might affect future human colonization of these planets. In the 1960s, it was also thought that the harmful contamination of these bodies could even potentially affect earth.Finally, in the heights of the cold war, both the superpowers feared the potential for extending the earth's arms race elsewhere and makes for global collaboration in these uninhabited places [other treaties also include Antartica under similar protections]Reading: Preventing the Forward Contamination of Marsaffirms that the search for extraterrestrial life is an important objective of space research, that the planet of Mars may offer the only feasible opportunity to conduct this search during the foreseeable future, that contamination of this planet would make such a search far more difficult and possibly even prevent for all time an unequivocal resultThe National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America urges that scientists plan lunar and planetary studies with great care and deep concern so that initial operations do not compromise and make impossible forever after critical scientific experiments.The need for sterilization is only temporary. Mars and possibly Venus need to remain uncontaminated only until study by manned ships becomes possible Also see: Why Curiosity can't touch that Mars water - CNET
